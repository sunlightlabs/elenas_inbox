May marks both teen pregnancy prevention month and the first anniversary of the National
Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. Today, in recognition of both these events, The First
Lady recognizes the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy's first 12 honorees --
individuals from around the country whose community-based efforts to prevent teen pregnancy
are making a difference. The First Lady also discusses two new teen pregnancy prevention grant
programs and findings from a new study of childbearing and family planning to be released later
this month by the Department of Health and Human Services, both announced yesterday in
California by Sec. Shalala.

Background

The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy is a private nonprofit organization dedicated
to preventing teen pregnancy by supporting values and stimulating actions that are consistent
with a pregnancy-free adolescence. The "Campaign" was stimulated by President Clinton's
challenge issued in his 1995 State ofthe Union address that "parents and leaders across the
country ... join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference."
May 1997 marks the first ariniversary of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.

Following his 1995 State of the Union comments, the President held a meeting at the White
House with a group of prominent teen pregnancy prevention experts and advocates to discuss
what might be done to combat the problem. From that meeting emerged a serious private sector
planning effort that led to the creation of the National Campaign. The Campaign is chaired by
former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean and has a distinguished Board of Director including
Katherine Graham, Whoopi Goldberg, The Hon. Nancy Kassebaum, The Hon. Warren B.
Rudman, William A. Galston, and others. Isabel Sawhill, President of the Campaign, was
President Clinton's former Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

To commemorate the anniversary of the National Campaign, the First Lady is recognizing 12
honorees whom the Campaign chose for their outstanding leadership in the area of teen
pregnancy prevention. Each of these people represent community-based prevention approaches
that are are making the incidences of teen pregnancy more rare and are, at the same time,
strengthening the surrounding communities.

The honorees' work embodies several key themes that are essential to preventing teen pregnancy:
emphasizing values and self-esteem in working with adolescents; forging partnerships with the
corporate sector; encouraging adult-child communication; involving youth in the discussion;
emphasizing the importance of male involvement in prevention; and involving the media.
Honorees from Elayne Bennett, President of the Best Friends Foundation to Wade Hom, Director
ofthe National Fatherhood Initiative, Sheila Johnson of Black Entertainment Television, Inc. and
the other honorees represent the diverse approaches needed to tackle the problem of teen
pregnancy.

Just yesterday, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, announced two new
community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote responsible behavior. One
program will be aimed at teenage girls and the other at teenage boys. Both grants grow out of
Secretary Donna Shalala's new Girl Power! Campaign which is aimed at enhancing self-esteem,
promoting good health, and preventing unhealthy behaviors among girls 9 to 14 years old. Each
ofthe grant programs will total about $1 million per year and involve public-private partnerships
organized by individual communities.

The Secretary also discussed a new study, to be released later this month by HHS, that shows the
percentage of teenagers who have had sex declined in the 1990s after increasing steadily for more
than two decades. The decline is small -- 5 percent -- but is significant because it shows that the
long-term increase in teenage sexual activity may finally be over. This data is part of a new study
of child bearing and family planning covering all women 15-44.

Administration Accomplishments

May marks both teen pregnancy prevention month and the first anniversary of the National
Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. Over the past five years, this Administration has made
progress toward reducing teen pregnancy rates, and continues to work to tackle this problem.
However, it is important to note that, despite our progress, there is still much work to do. Teen
pregnancy is a tough problem t\1at demands everyone's involvement from the community level
on up.

      Just yesterday, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, announced
       two new community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote responsible
       behavior. One program will be aimed at teenage girls and the other at teenage boys. Both
       grants grow out of Secretary Donna Shalala's new Girl Power! Campaign which is aimed
       at enhancing self-esteem, promoting good health, and preventing unhealthy behaviors
       among girls 9 to 14 years old. Each of the grant programs will total about $1 million per
       year and involve public-private partnerships organized by individual communities.

      The Secretary also discussed a new study, to be released later this month by HHS, that
       shows the percentage of teenagers who have had sex declined in the 1990s after
       increasing steadily for more than two decades. The decline is small -- 5 percent -- but is
       significant because it shows that the long-term increase in teenage sexual activity may
       finally be over. This data is part of a new study of child bearing and family planning
       covering all women 15-44.

      This past January, President Clinton launched a comprehensive effort by his
       Administration to prevent teen pregnan~y in this country. The initiative, led by the
       Department of Health and Human Services, responded to a call from the President and
       Congress as part of the new welfare reform legislation and builds upon work already
       underway in the Administration.

      HHS last October released data showing an 8 percent drop in teen birth rates from 1991
       to 1995, and the latest data available though June 1996 indicates that the decline has
       continued. The birth rate for teenagers as ofJune 1996 stood at 55.6 births per 1,000
       women aged 15-19 years, compared to 62.1 in 1991.

      The new welfare law signed by the President on August 22, 1996 contains several
       provisions addressing teen pregnancy prevention: unmarried minor parents are required to
       stay in school and live at home, or in an adult-supervised setting in order to receive
       assistance; Second Chance Homes" -- adult supervised residential homes designed to
       provide teen parents with the skills and supports they need to finish school, become good
       role models, and providers for their children -- are allowed and encouraged; $50 million a
       year in new funding for state abstinence education activities is provided starting FY 1998;
       finally, the new law includes tough child support measurements that send the strongest
       possible message to young boys and girls that they should not have children until they are
       ready to provide for those children.

                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
      across the country ... to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to
      make a difference." In response to his challenge, last may The National Campaign to
      Prevent Teen Pregnancy was formed. The National Campaign is a private nonprofit
      organization dedicated to preventing teen pregnancy by supporting values and stimulating
      actions that are consistent with a pregnancy-free adolescence. May 1997 marks the first
      anniversary of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.

     Since 1993, the Administration has supported innovative and promising teen pregnancy
      prevention strategies tailored to the unique needs of communities. HHS-supported
      programs already reach about 30 percent or 1,410 communities in the United States.

     The Administration Strategy is also building partnerships among national, state and local
      organizations, including the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy; schools,
      businesses; religious institutions; federal, state and local governments; tribes and tribal
      organizations; parents; and teenagers, uniting efforts to send a strong message of
      abstinence and personal responsibility to young people and provide them with
      opportunities for the future.

     Finally, the Administration is committed to improving data collection, research and
      evaluation to further our understanding of the magnitUde, trends, and causes of teen
      pregnancies and births. To develop targeted prevention strategies, and to assess how well
      these strategies work.

The Challenge

     However, as much as we have done and as much progress as we have seen, there is much
      more work to do. Teen pregnancy remains a major social problem for this country and
      one that none of us can ignore.

     Every year in this country, over 1 million teenagers become pregnant and four in 10 girls
      become pregnant as least once before turning 20.

     The encouraging recent decline in the U.S. teen birth rate is counterbalanced by a
      negative trend: today, nearly three-quarters of teen births are to unmarried teens, while as
      recently as 1960, only 50 percent were. Today, teen mothers make up the largest group
      (48 percent) of all first births to unmarried women.

     Early parenting limits a young mother's likelihood of completing high school -- less than
      one-third of teens who begin their families before age 18 ever complete high school --
      and increases the likelihood that that young mother W'ill end up in poverty.

     We should be especially concerned about the children of teen parents. When compared to
      children of older mothers, children of teen mothers have more health problems, do much
      worse in school, live in home environments of lower quality, suffer higher rates of abuse
      and neglect, and are more likely to become teen mothers themselves.

                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
                        Whatever Happened to Childhood?
         Published by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy

Following is a brief summary of the key findings from the National Campaign To Prevent Teen
Pregnancy draft report, "Whatever Happened to Childhood,?" to be published in two to four
weeks.

The report aptly illustrates teen pregnancy as a social crisis that continues to break down family,
community and common culture. The message the report sends is twofold: 1) although we are
making some progress, there is much more work to do and we must not let our attention stray
from this critical national issue and, 2) despite consistent community-based efforts, the evidence
has not born out a simple solution to the problem so we must continue to be creative, innovative
and persistent in our efforts.

Of the many community experiments around the country, the report states, most have exhibited
mixed outcomes, and no one program stands out as having produced clear, replicable results.
Community approaches include sex education aimed at delaying sexual activity and reducing the
number of sexual partners and using birth control; abstinence only programs; support for
community-based family planning services; comprehensive approaches stresses components
from each approach and; programs dedicated to nurturing and guiding young people.

In addition to these conclusions, the report also presents some interesting observations that may
have future policy implications.

First, the vast majority (85 percent) of pregnancies among teens are not fully planned or
unintended. Rather they result from teens' ambivalence about pregnancy, accidents, their
confusion about preventing pregnancy, and sometimes their failure to make any clear decision
about sexual activity.

Second, many communities do not address the problem at all because the conflict over which
approach to use can become so intense and destructive' to the community that a community
decides to do nothing at all. Therefore, the report states, a new and emerging approach to teen
pregnancy prevention is community conflict resolution. The report lays out an excellent example
of this approach at work. In 1990, the rural community of Tillamook County, Oregon had the
highest teen pregnancy rate in the state but fought bitterly over a solution, including the Board of
Education voting down several proposals. Finally, the County decided to embrace a new ethic of
"unity of purpose, diversity of means," allowing various segments of the community to develop
their own intensive initiatives, from creating a church-based abstinence program to improving
access to family planning programs. By 1994, the county teen pregnancy rate had dropped by 70
percent, becoming the lowest in the state. This story bares out research by Dr. Kristen Moore
that says teen pregnancy programs that send mixed messages to teens actually work because the
teen will be exposed to all messages and will take what works for her or him, whether it be
abstinence, birth control, or self-esteem raising.

Third, although the teen birth rate has decreased in the past few years, the number of births to
teens increased in 1993 and 1994, reflecting an overall increase in the U.S. teen population.
Because the number of teens is expected to increase further, so will the number of pregnancies
                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


The report tells its story using mostly previously released data that remain relevant. Following
are facts from the report worth reviewing.

      Every year in this country, over 1 million teenagers become pregnant and four in 10 girls
       become pregnant as least once before turning 20.

      The pregnancy rate increased among all girls age 15-19 by 23 percent between 1972 and
       1990 from 95 to 117 pregnancies per 1,000 women, and then declined to 112 per 1,000
       women in 1992 ( the year for which the most recent data is available). At the same time,
       the pregnancy rate among sexually experienced girls decreased 19 percent, largely due to
       increased use of contraception.

      By 1991, the teen birth rate had reached 62 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19, its
       highest point in the past two decades. Since then, that rate has fallen slowly to 57 births
       per 1,000 women in 1995.

      The encouraging recent decline in the U.S. teen birth rate is counterbalanced by a
       negative trend: today, nearly three-quarters of teen births are to unmarried teens, while as
       recently as 1960, only 50 percent were. Today, teen mothers make up the largest group
       (48 percent) of all first births to unmarried women.

      Birth rates are higher among African-American and Hispanic teens than among white
       teens

      While most pregnant teens are 18 or 19 years old, about 40 percent are 17 or younger and
       about half of all pregnant teens ages 15-19 are white.

      Many of the fathers of children born to teen mothers are older -- nearly 40 percent of
       those young men who impregnate a minor teen (under 18) are 20 years old or older.

      More than half of the teen pregnancies result in a birth (1/3 end in abortion and 14 percent
       in miscarriage) and of those who give birth most keep their child rather than put it up for
       adoption.

      Early parenting limits a young mother's likelihood of completing high school-- less than
       one-third of teens who begin their families before age 18 ever complete high school.

      When compared to children of older mothers, children of teen mothers have more health
       problems, do much worse in school, live in home environments oflower quality, suffer
       higher rates of abuse and neglect, and are more likely to become teen mothers themselves.
