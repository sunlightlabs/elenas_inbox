     MEMORANDUM FOR ELENA KAGAN AND SALLY KATZEN


     FROM:          JULIE FERNANDES AND CECILIA ROUSE

     SUBJECT:       ASSESSMENT OF H-2A "IDEAS INVENTORY"

     DATE: April 24, 2009


     Attached is our assessment ofthe positions of USDA and DOL regarding the proposals put forth
     in DOL's "ideas inventory." The shaded boxes indicate important proposals for which there is
     agency disagreement and thus should be discussed at today's meeting. We have also attached a
     list of the current program requirements that includes definitions of the most important terms.

     In order to better understand the agencies' positions, it is useful to understand the underlying
     policy tensions. Growers see themselves as having a choice between three categories of workers:
     legal U.S. workers, illegal workers, and H-2A workers. Which category they draw from is
     almost exclusively determined by total cost. For example, if the total cost of hiring a U.S.
     worker (including wages, taxes, housing, etc.) is higher than the total cost of hiring an H-2A
     worker, the grower will hire the H-2A worker. Therefore, the total compensation offered by the
     H-2A program becomes the effective total compensation ceiling for U.S. workers. In addition,
     the presence of large numbers of illegal farmworkers distorts the labor market such that the
     growers' response to an inability to find sufficient legal U.S. workers is to hire illegal workers,
     rather than increase wages or improve working conditions. Thus, though we may want to require
     fair wages and working conditions in the H-2A program, if the cost of using the program is too
     high, the growers will hire undocumented workers.                                            .

     USDA's goal is to provide a steady, reliable source of farrnworkers for U.S. growers. USDA
     believes that the domestic labor force can never completely satisfy the labor needs of agriculture,
     particularly during peak times, and therefore there will always be a need for temporary foreign
     agricultural workers. In a world in which the INS is increasingly cracking down on the
     employment of undocumented workers, the USDA (and the growers) would prefer that the
     foreign workers that they employ be authorized to work. Their goal is thus to set a wage (or total
     compensation) floor that is low enough that growers will readily use the H-2A program (rather
     than hire undocumented workers), but that is high enough to continue to attract existing U.S.
     farmworkers. However, they believe that an H-2A program that would set the wage (or total
     compensation) floor high enough to attract many more U.S. workers would drive growers into
     the illegal labor market.

     DOL is concerned that a low wage (or total compensation) floor becomes a low ceiling for U.S.
     workers and therefore hurts these already impoverished workers. They are not as convinced that
     the domestic labor force could never satisfy growers needs at a reasonable wage; rather, they
     argue that agricultural wages have been kept artificially low because of the large presence of
     undocumented workers. Labor believes that if agricultural wages were allowed to rise, additional



                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
job of facilitating matches between workers and employers that would give domestic farm
workers more stable employment and growers access to a steady supply of workers.

As you read through the following list of proposals, you will notice that in many areas (e.g.,
wages, housing, transportation) the issue is whether the proposal increases the total cost to the
employer or shifts those costs to the government or the farmworker. USDA generally opposes
reforms that would increase grower costs. The Labor Department generally opposes reforms that
transfer costs to the government or the farmworker, and favors reforms that aim at improving
labor conditions or wages for U.S. and foreign farmworkers. Because the focus is on total costs
(with wages and housing being the most significant areas of concern) we cannot decide on
individual reform components in isolation.

                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

       Recruitment: The agricultural employer must engage in independent positive (i.e.,
        active) recruitment of U.S. workers, including newspaper and radio advertising in areas of
        expected labor supply. Such recruitment must be at least equivalent to that conducted by
        non-H-2A agricultural employers to secure U.S. workers.

      . Wages: Employers must pay H-2A workers the "adverse effect wage rate" (AEWR),
         the applicable prevailing wage rate, or the statutory minimum wage rate, whichever is
         higher. The AEWRs are the minimum wage rates which the DOL has determined must
         be offered and paid to U.S. and H-2A workers, and they are established for each state.
         The region- or state-wide AEWR for all agricultural employment for which H-2A
         certification is being sought, is equal to the annual weighted average hourly wage rate for
         field and livestock workers (combined) for the region as published annually by the
         USDA. I The AEWRs are designed to prevent the employment of these nonimmigrant
         alien workers from adversely affecting the wages of !)imilarly employed U.S. agricultural
         workers.

       Housing: The employer must provide free and approved housing to all workers, both
        foreign and domestic, who are not able to return to their residences the same day.

       Meals: The employer must provide either three meals a day to each worker or furnish free
        and convenient cooking/kitchen facilities. If meals are provided, then the employer may
        charge each worker a certain amount per day for these meals.

       Transportation: The employer is responsible for the following types of transportation for
        workers: I) After a worker has completed fifty percent of the work contract period, the
        employer must reimburse the worker for the cost of transportation and subsistence from
        the place of recruitment to the place of work; 2) The employer must provide free
        transportation between any required housing site and the work site for any worker who is
        eligible for such housing; 3) Upon completion of the work contract, the employer must
        pay return transportation to the worker's prior residence or transportation to the next job.

       Workers' Compensation Insurance: The employer must provide Workers'
        Compensation or equivalent insurance for all workers, both foreign and domestic.

          Three-fourths Guarantee: The employer must guarantee to offer each worker employment for at least three-fourths of the
           workdays in the work contract and any extensions. In applying this guarantee and determining any additional wages due, the
           following facts must be established: 1) The beginning and ending dates of employment; 2) The number of workdays between
           the established beginning and ending dates of the guarantee period; and 3)The hours of worktime for the guarantee. The
           guarantee is then established by computing seventy-five percent of the established total hours of work time in the contract
           period. Note that the employer may not count any hours offered on such days in which the worker refused or failed to work.

          Fifty Percent Rule: The employer must employ any qualified U.S. worker who applies for an available job until fifty percent
           of the contract period has elapsed.

          Tools and Supplies: The employer must furnish at no cost to the worker all necessary tools and supplies, unless it is common
           practice for the worker to provide certain items.

          Labor Dispute: The employer must ensure that the available job for which the employer is requesting H-2A certification is not
           vacant due to a strike or lockout.

          Certification Fee: A fee will be charged to an employer granted temporary alien agricultural labor certification. The fee is
           $100, plus $10 for each available job certified, up to a maximum fee of $1 ,000 for each certification granted.

          Farm Labor Contractors (Crewleaders): A farm labor contractor is an organization or entity that either supervises, recruits,
           transports, houses, or solicits farm labor other than the owner of the work site. Bona fide registered farm labor contractors may
           be eligible to apply for and receive H-2A certification, although they generally deal with domestic laborers. Farm labor
           contractors would be required, as employers, to provide all the minimum benefits specified by the H-2A regulations, including
           th e three- D h s guarantee and tel y percent ru Ie.
