    LOW-INCOME MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE
                             July 6,1998

Today, the President announced a new outreach campaign to help millions of low-income seniors
and people with disabilities get assistance in paying Medicare premiums. A study by Families
USA reports that over 3 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries are not enrolled in the
Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) and related programs that pay for Medicare premiums
and (for some) copayments and deductibles. This assistance was expanded last year in the
Balanced Budget Act. However, as this new report underscores, many eligible beneficiaries are
not aware of these cost-sharing protections and others have difficulty accessing this critically
needed assistance.

To address this problem, the President has requested that the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) and the SoCial Security Administration (SSA) launch a multi-faceted effort to
enroll eligible Medicare beneficiaries in QMB and related programs. These new initiatives,
which build on existing efforts to help identify and enroll eligible beneficiaries and parallel the
President's efforts on children's health outreach, include:

    Launching major new initiatives to educate Medicare beneficiaries about premium
     assistance programs. HHS and SSA will make unprecedented efforts to ensuring that
     beneficiaries know about these programs by distributing clear, plainly written information
     about these programs by:

        Sending written information to all 38 million Medicare beneficiaries about this
        program through pamphlets that will be sent to all beneficiaries this fall.

        Informing everyone of the 1.8 million new Medicare beneficiaries about this program
        in the Medicare initial enrollment package that is sent to these beneficiaries.
        Including information describing this program and an eligibility screening
        worksheet on the new Medicare Internet site, "www.medicare.gov," which is used by
        millions of older Americans and their families, as well as others who work with the
        elderly and people with the disabilities.

        Sending program information to more than 36 million individuals receiving Social
        Security benefits in the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) notices this fall.

        Distributing 450,000 pamphlets as well as placing posters in SSA's 1,300 field offices
        where millions of beneficiaries go to enroll and ask questions about these programs. SSA
        will direct its field office employees to reach out to the millions of beneficiaries they see
        every day to ensure they are informed about QMB and related programs.



   Encouraging the use of a simplified application process. In July, the Health Care
    Financing Administration (HCF A) will send a letter to State Medicaid agencies that includes

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

                    a model, simplified application as well as examples of successful outreach and enrollment
                    programs. HCFA will encourage states to adopt simple, user-friendly procedures such as a
                    mail-in application.

                   Creating a Federal-State-consumer advocate task force to develop new strategies to
                    enroll eligible beneficiaries. Beginning this month, HHS, SSA, the National Governors'
                    Association, and advocates of the elderly and people with disabilities will collaborate to
                    identify and implement strategies to educate beneficiaries about this program and to make it
                    easier to enroll.

                   Targeting eligible beneficiaries through direct mailings. This fall, HCFA will send a
                    letter to a targeted group of beneficiaries who are likely to be eligible for these protections.
                    The targeting population list will come from a list of beneficiaries supplied by SSA that the
                    agency believes may be eligible. The letter will explain the program and encourage
                    beneficiaries to apply.

                   Providing the State Insurance Counseling and Assistance Programs (ICAs) with
                    materials to assist beneficiaries in enrolling in the premium assistance programs. ICAs
                    provide assistance on insurance and benefits to millions of older and disabled Americans.

             These new initiatives build on an ongoing commitment by HCF A and SSA to target and enroll
             these vulnerable, low income Americans. For example, HCFA has provided training materials
             on identifying and assisting potential beneficiaries to providers, advocates and States. SSA has
             included information on programs in SSA pamphlets and handouts that could reach potential
             candidates and conducted training for staff who interact with beneficiaries.

             premium and cost sharing assistance programs, which are offered in all States.
