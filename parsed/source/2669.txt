                      assistance to States and, through the States, to local agencies, to provide educational services to
                      children and youth who are neglected or delinquent.

                              Section 141, program name. Section 141 of the bill would amend the heading of Part D
                      of Title I of the ESEA to read, "State Agency Programs for Children and Youth Who Are
                      Neglected or Delinquent", This name would more accurately reflect the bill's proposed deletion
                      of the authority for local programs in Subpart 2 of Part D.

                             Section 142 findings; pumose; program authorized [ESEA, §1401]. Section 142(a) of the
                      bill would update the findings in section 1401(a) of the ESEA, and shorten them to reflect the
                      proposed deletion of Subpart 2.

                             Section 142(b) would amend the statement of purpose in section 1401(b) to reflect the
                      proposed deletion of Subpart 2.

                      would delete section 1402(b) of the ESEA, which requires that States retain funds generated
                      throughout the State under Part A of Title I (Basic Grants) on the basis of youth residing in local
                      correctional facilities or attending community day programs for delinquent children and youth,
                      and use those Part A funds for local programs under Subpart 2 of Part D. This conforms to the
                      bill's proposal to delete Subpart 2. Section 142 would also make other conforming amendments
                      to section 1402.

                              Section 144, allocation offunds [ESEA, § 14121. Section 144 of the bill would make
                      editorial amendments to section 1412 of the ESEA, relating to the allocation of Part D sub grants
                      to eligible State agencies.

                              Section 145, State plan and State agency applications [ESEA, §1414]. Section 145(2)(A)
                      of the bill would amend section 1414(a)(2) of the Act, relating to the contents of a State's plan,
                      to require the plan to provide that participating children will be held to the same challenging
                      academic standards, as well as given the same opportunity to learn, as they would if they were
                      attending local public schools. Section 145 would also correct erroneous citations in section
                      1414.

                             Section 146, use offunds [ESEA, §1415]. Section 146 of the bill would correct an
                      erroneous citation in section 1415 of the ESEA, relating to the pennissible use of Part D funds.

                              Section 147, local agency programs [ESEA, §§1421-14261. Section 147 of the bill would
                      repeal Subpart 2 (Local Agency Programs) of Part D and redesignate Subpart 3 (General
                                                                     I-D-l
                                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion




                Provisions) as Subpart 2. The local agency program is unduly complicated for States to
                administer and does not promote effective services for children who are, or have been, neglected
                or delinquent. Those services are better provided through other local, State, and Federal
                programs, including other ESEA programs, such as Basic Grants under Part A.

                      Section 148, program evaluations rESEA, §1431]. Section 148(1) of the bill would
                amend section 1431(a) of the ESEA, relating to the scope of evaluations under Part D, to
                confonn to the proposed repeal of Subpart 2.

                        Section 148(2) would amend section 1431(b) to require that the multiple measures of
                student progress that a State agency must use in conducting program evaluations, while
                consistent with section 1414's requirement to provide participating children the same
                opportunities to learn and to hold them to the same standards that would apply if they were
                attending local public schools, must be appropriate for the students and feasible for the agency.
                This modification would recognize that, for a variety of reasons, it may not be appropriate to
                administer the same tests to students who are, or have been, neglected or delinquent, as are given
                to children of the same age who are in traditional public schools.

                        Section 148(3) of the bill would amend section 1431(c), relating to the results of
                evaluations, to reflect the proposed repeal of Subpart 2.

                        Section 149, definitions rESEA, §14321. Section 149 of the bill would delete the
                definition of "at-risk youth" in paragraph (2) of section 1432, and renumber the remaining
                paragraphs. The deleted tenn is used only in Subpart 2, which would be repealed.

                       Section 150, confonning amendments rESEA, §§14302, 14307]. Section 150 of the bill
                would make confonning amendments to section 14302 and 14307 of the ESEA, to reflect the
                proposed repeal of Subpart 2 ofPart D of Title I of the ESEA.
