MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                    Bruce Reed, Elena Kagan
                         Gene Sperling, Sally Katzen

SUBJECT:                 Summer Announcements and Events

       Listed below are ideas for announcements and events that you-could do this summer. We
have noted which of our offices has primary responsibility for each idea.

Health (DPCINEC as noted below)

Release New Executive Order Authorizing OPM to Terminate FEHBP Insurance Plans
That Are Out of Compliance with Kennedy-Kassebaum Law. This policy would strengthen
enforcement of the Kennedy-Kassebaum law by allowing the Federal Employees' Health
Benefits Plan (FEHBP) to take action against any insurer that discriminates against sicker
patients -- including by terminating the insurance plan. Although we have not seen many reports
of discrimination recently, advocates would characterize this action as reducing the likelihood of
future abuses. We would announce the policy at an event including men and women who have
suffered from these kinds of insurance practices. (DPC)

Release New HHS Report on Long-Term Care and Announce Policy Initiative(s). A new
report from HHS shows that millions of American families care for chronically ill elderly .
relatives and friends, and that this care places a significant strain on families. The President
could announce an initiative to encourage private long-term care insurance by offering it through
the FEHBP and/or counseling Medicare beneficiaries to consider private insurance. In addition,
if we are willing to consider proposals with budgetary effects, we could announce a new respite
care tax credit, which we are in the preliminary stages of reviewing. (DPCINEC)

Approve the 25th State Children'S Health Insurance Program. As of today, HHS has
approved the CHIP plans of20 states, which should cover about 2.5 million children when fully
implemented; we expect to reach the half-way mark by approving the 25th CHIP plan early next
month. We could use this occasion to release another progress report and hold an event featuring
families already helped by the program and a bipartisan group of governors. (DPC)

Enhance Welfare-to-Work Commitment by Giving States Option to Maintain Health
Insurance for Working Adults. We may be able to issue a new HHS regulation that would
allow more states to provide Medicaid coverage to more low-income two-parent families.
(Current federal law, applicable in all states without pre-welfare law waivers on this subject,



                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              HeX-Dump Conversion

limits Medicaid to only those two-parent families in which the parents work less than 100 hours
per month.) States believe that this regulation would enhance welfare-to-work efforts and
encourage two-parent families. The regulation, however, has large cost implications (about $800
million over five years), and we are currently discussing with OMB whether an offset for such a
regulation is needed. (DPC)

Announce Policies for People with Disabilities. We have been working on administrative and
legislative policies to enable people with disabilities to (1) reside in their communities, rather
than institutions, and (2) return to work activities. For example, we are working on a legislative
proposal to provide personal care assistance services to enable people with disabilities to return
to work. We also are exploring ways to develop and spread new technologies that enable people
with disabilities to live and work more easily. These proposals generally will have budget
implications; we are currently working with OMB on finding appropriate offsets. We could
announce these actions on July 26, the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
(DPCINEC)

Announce Outreach Effort for Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries. A new report,
to be released by Families USA in early July, will show that about 3.9 million eligible Medicare
beneficiaries -- nearly half of all eligible beneficiaries -- do not get premium assistance. We
could release an executive directive to RCF A, SSA, and the Administration on Aging to
implement new outreach and enrollment initiatives. (At the very least, such an action would
inoculate us against the Families USA report, which is likely to receive a great deal of attention).
 (NEC)

Education (DPC/NEC as noted below)

Announce New Legislation, With Offsets, to Reduce Class Size. Senator Murray intends to
introduce legislation with as many as 20 co-sponsors to implement your class size initiative.
DPC and OMB are working with Murray's staff on potential offsets that she could use in making
this announcement. We think you could participate in the announcement of this legislation (as
you previously expressed interest in doing) without binding yourself to using the offsets for this
(and only this) purpose. (DPC)

Announce New Bilingual Education Plan. You could transmit legislation to reform the federal
bilingual program, including by requiring school districts to establish a goal of moving all
Limited English Proficient (LEP) students into regular English language classes within three
years. Weare sending you a separate memo on the pros and cons of taking this action.
Irrespective of whether you decide to transmit such legislation, you could take other actions to
assist LEP students -- for example (1) propose ways to strengthen teaching for LEP students
(~, by recruitment and training initiatives); (2) issue a directive to the Secretary of Education to
report on best practices of teaching English to LEP students, as well as to conduct or support
further research in this area; (3) support community-based initiatives that supplement school
programs for LEP students; and (4) propose ways of strengthening foreign language education




                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

for English-speaking students. Some of these proposals would have budgetary implications, but
we do not yet have good cost estimates. (DPC)

Announce First Grants of Comprehensive School Reform (Obey/Porter) Program. The
Education Department will soon be ready to announce grants under the new
Comprehensive School Reform program. These grants will support proven school reforms
in hundreds ofschools. You or the Vice President could make this announcement. (DPC)

Launch the Ed'ucation Department's Summer Reading Initiative. Seventy partnerships
across the country will launch summer reading programs aimed at young children next
month. You could help to kick off these programs, while calling on Congress again to enact
America Reads (if it has not yet done so). (DPC)

Announce Grant to DC Training Alliance. You could announce a Labor Department pilot
program that would give a $1.2 million planning grant (the "metro-tech grant") to the DC, MD,
and VA job-training systems to train workers to meet the demand in this area's high-tech
industry. The pilot program will fund 100 workers. We expect the pilot to lead to a
demonstration project serving 3,000 people at a cost of $17 million. We can announce this grant
anytime the near future. (NEC)

Participate in School Construction and Smaller Class Size Day. You, the Vice President,
Mrs. Clinton, and Mrs. Gore all could participate in a back-to-school day that would focus on
school construction and smaller class sizes. In advance of this day, you would ask parents,
volunteers, Members of Congress, and community leaders to join together to help rebuild,
renovate, and modernize local public schoo is. The event would provide a terrific visual and give
Democrats in Congress a chance to highlight this important issue in the fall. (NEC)

Report on Success of School-to-Work Program. We expect a major study to be released soon
on School-ta-Work, one of the signature programs of your first year in office. Ifit is positive, we
might use the release of this study to highlight the program, call for the business community's
continued participation in it, and attack right-wing opposition. We are not sure ofthe timing of
this report. One problem with this event is that our current budget scales back the school-to-
work program (from $400 million to $250 million). (NEC)

Crime and Drugs (DPC)

Announce Support for Child Access Prevention Legislation, Issue Child-Proof Gun
Challenge, and Issue Regulation on New Gun Signs. You could (1) support child access
prevention legislation (both Sen. Durbin and Rep. McCarthy have bills) that would hold adults
liable if they give children easy access to guns; (2) challenge industry to get a child-proof gun
(i.e., a gun that can be shot only by authorized adults) on the market by the year 2000; and/or (3)
announce a Treasury Department regulation (responding to a directive you signed a few months
ago) requiring gun dealers to post signs warning gun purchasers about their responsibility to keep




                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

guns away from children.

Report on Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative and Press for Congress to Fund Our
Budget Request. The second anniversary of your gun tracing initiative falls in July, and we may
have a report by then on the continued success of this program. (If not, the report will be ready
later in the summer.) Our budget asked for $28 million to expand this initiative, which the
House appropriations subcommittee fully funded last week. An event could keep up the pressure
for full funding ofthis initiative. We could combine the event with the actions on youth access
to guns described above.

Announce Federal Drug Strike Force for Chicago and Support for Chicago's Anti-Gang·
Ordinance. DOJ is prepared to announce that it will dedicate some 300 federal agents and 20
prosecutors to form a drug strike force in Chicago. We have promised Mayor Daley that we will
make this announcement soon. At the same time, we could comment on the brief we just filed in
the Supreme Court supporting Chicago's anti-gang ordinance.

Announce New Demonstration Project to Fund Faith-Based Anti-Crime Programs. DOJ is
now considering whether and how to put together a demonstration project to fund faith-based
anti-crime programs, such as the one profiled recently in a Newsweek cover story. We will have
to work through some constitutional concerns, but we could be ready to go on this new effort by
mid-summer. Some of your advisors, however, have reservations about such a religiously-
oriented grant program.

Announce New COPS Grants. We will have several opportunities this summer to announce
new cop grants, including grants targeted to combating methamphetamine use and extensions of
prior grants (i.e., a fourth year of funding) in small cities. We should try to time such an
announcement to coincide with new crime statistics.

COPS in Schools. By the end of the summer, the Departments of Justice and Education should
be ready to (1) offer recommendations to you for getting more police to work with schools (in
response to your directive last week); (2) release COPS grants to provide additional law
enforcement assistance in schools; (3) hold a conference on how law enforcement officers can
help to keep schools safe; and (4) issue a report on the success of the Safe and Drug Free Schools
Program.. We could try to package these announcements in a single event.

Release Early Warning Guide for Schools; Follow Up With Annual Report on School
Safety. In compliance with your recent directive, the Departments of Justice and Education are
scheduled to complete by the end of summer a guide for schools on how to identify and respond
to early warning signs of troubled youth. We could combine release of this report with a White
House meeting with officials of the cities that recently have suffered school shootings. A month
or so later, in early October, the Justice Department will be ready to release the annual report on
school safety that you ordered in the wake of the Paducah shooting. This document will compile
all data on school crime, discuss successful strategies to reduce school violence, and include a




                                                               Automated Recorc!S Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

checklist for parents on school safety. You could use the release of this report as an opportunity
to address hundreds of schools by satellite on school violence issues.

Laun~h   Nationwide Phase of Our Anti-Drug Media Campaign. You are currently scheduled
to announce the national roll-out of the $195 million media campaign in July. ONDCP will buy
a "roadblock" on network TV that night, unveil new ads, and host local events in scores of
participating cities.

Release Drug Court Grants. You could announce the latest drug court grants from DOJ and
highlight the success of this program, as you previously have indicated some interest in doing.
(As you know, a recent study showed some very good results.) You could combine the release of
these grants with the launch of the anti-drug media campaign discussed just above, or
alternatively combine it with the release of new DUF/ADAM (Drug Use Forecasting/Arrestee
Drug Abuse Monitoring) data, which will almost certainly show that most arrestees in our major
cities test positive for drugs, and that more resources are needed to test, treat, and sanction these
offenders.

Release Results of Household Survey. The Household Survey -- one of two major drug'
surveys on teen drug use -- should be out by August. Last year's survey was the first to indicate a
dip in teenage drug use, and this year's is likely to show the same. The Survey also will contain
new data on youth tobacco use.

Release Stalking Report and Associated Policies. DOJ is preparing a report showing that
about eight million women in this country report having been stalked. Weare working with DOJ
on policy recommendations to go with this report, but have not yet determined their exact
content.

Tobacco (DPC)

Bring Medicare Suits Against Tobacco Companies? We and the Counsel's Office will advise
you within the next couple of weeks on whether the federal government should bring suit against
the tobacco companies for losses to the Medicare program caused by tobacco-related disease. If
you choose to go ahead with these suits, you can direct the Attorney General to prepare the suit
for filing. (There is little chance that the suit will actually be ready to file this summer.)

Prevent Filmmakers from Using Federal Facilities for Films that Contain Youth Smoking.
We are exploring whether agencies that oversee federal facilities (~, DOD, the Forest Service)
can require, as a condition of granting a permit to film a movie on those facilities, that the movie
not show (or perhaps, not glamorize) youth smoking or drug use. Your advisors are very split on
this idea -- some love it, some hate it -- and we are continuing to explore it.

Release Report on Effects of Price Increases on Youth Smoking. We are ready to release a
Treasury Department report showing how price increases can dramatically reduce youth



                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

smoking. This report should be useful to show the absurdity of the House Republicans' "no-
money" approach to this problem. When they release that bill, we will have Treasury (or
commission an independent expert) to do a report on the likely effects of the bill on youth
smoking.

Release Results of Household Survey. As discussed above.

Welfare-to-Work (DPC/NEC as noted below)

Release Report Showing the Increase in the Proportion of Welfare Recipients Going to
Work. Following on the GAO report last week, HHS is scheduled to report to Congress on the
increase in work among welfare recipients. The report should have some new data, although it
also will collate previously released figures. Sometime this summer, HHS also will receive
information from the states on whether they are meeting the welfare law's work participation
rates. This information should generate a fair bit of interest, but it is not yet clear whether the
news will be good. (DPC)

Endorse Individual Development Account Bill. You have indicated interest in doing an event
to endorse and highlight the Coats-Harkin IDA legislation. This bill would establish a four-year,
$100 million demonstration program under which state, local, and nonprofit entities would match
money deposited into IDAs by low-income families. One event idea is for you to go to a
community development bank and help a welfare recipient open a bank account; we could use
such an event to push for CDFI funding at the same time. Another, simpler idea is to do a Rose
Garden event with the sponsors of the bill and welfare recipients. (DPCINEC)

Food Safety (DPC)

Call for Congress to Fund Our Food Safety Initiative and Pass Legislation Giving FDA and
USDA More Enforcement Authority. The relevant House and Senate subcommittees allocated
almost no funds to our food safety initiative; at the same time, our proposals to give USDA
additional recall authority and give FDA additional authority over imported foods are
languishing. You could do an event with members of Congress and food safety advocates urging
Congress to act on these measures. (Summer is the time when people think most about these
issues.) We must ensure, however, that such an event is consistent with our overall strategy on
the Agriculture Appropriations bill.

Veterans (DPC)

Announce Coordinated Effort to Assist Homeless Veterans. We have been working with the
Veterans' Administration on a plan to help the 250,000 homeless veterans in this country. The
plan would involve outreach efforts, substance abuse treatment, and mental health care, in
addition to housing assistance. The annual cost would be about $30 million. Assuming we
believe we can find this amount of money in next year's budget, you could direct the VA now to




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

come back to you with a plan on how to address this issue.

Rural Issues (DPC/NEC)

Deliver Speech on Rural Issues. DPC, NEC, and USDA have prepared a rural agenda for a
speech sometime this summer. The agenda includes: (1) the use of new technologies, such as
distance learning and telemedicine, to benefit rural areas; (2) the enforcement of antitrust laws in
agricultural-related industries; (3) the expansion of programs that help farmers manage risk; (4)
the promotion of free trade; (5) the expansion of agricultural cooperatives; and (6) the renewal of
the ethanol subsidy. We also could announce alI or part of this agenda though a radio press·
conference in which you, the Vice President, and Secretary Glickman could participate.

Financial Services (DPC/NEC)

Announce Consumer Credit and Financial Services Bill of Rights. DPC and NEC are
developing an initiative -- including both administrative actions and a legislative proposal --
aimed at educating consumers about the use of credit and bank services, improving the
information consumers receive, and targeting predatory practices. This initiative is still at an
early stage of development, but we probably will be ready by near the end of the summer.

Pensions (NEC)

Announce Pension Proposals. Your advisors have reached consensus on two pension proposals
(in addition to the proposals announced in January). The joint and two-thirds/three-quarters
survivor annuity proposal would increase benefits for some surviving spouses of pension plan
participants, while the other proposal, initially advanced by Rep. Price (D-NC), would allow
workers to count FMLA time toward pension vesting requirements. This would ensure that those
(relatively few) workers close to the I,OOO-hour minimum requirement for vesting do not lose a
year of vesting because of time taken off under FMLA. This can be billed as a women's pension
item.

Housing (NEC)

Announce HUD-N_-\"'~ "One America" Agreement. HUD and the National Association of
Realtors (NAR) have reached a final agreement on the "One America Broker" program. Under
the program, NAR will sponsor training for real estate professionals on how to better serve
minority and immigrant home buyers. The training will address adherence to Fair Housing Act
principles, as well as ways to expand the housing choices available to minorities and other
underserved groups. Realtors who complete the course and commit to serving these groups
would be able to use the "One America" logo in advertising and promotional materials, which
could help them to attract additional clients. To be certified, realtors must be free of any Fair
Housing Act violations. The agreement could be announcedlhighlighted by you or the Vice
President at an event with a minority or immigrant new home buyer who previously experienced

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

discrimination and (possibly) a realtor with an outstanding record serving underserved groups.

International Economics (NEC)

Announce Trade Adjustment Assistance Package. We could do an event on helping everyone
benefit from a global economy. This event could have four different components, focused on
both worker and community adjustment:
o You could announce the consolidation and reform of the Trade Adjustment Assistance
        (TAA) program and the NAFTA-TAA program. This would more than fulfill your
        promise to strengthen the TAAINAFTA-TAA programs during the fast track debate.
o A possible Executive Order establishing a coordinating committee on community
        adjustment issues. This could be modeled after the Executive Order on defense
        adjustment programs.
o You could call on Congress to pass your EDA budget and NADBank budget, so that we
        can effectively deal with communities that have severe and sudden economic distress.
o Memorandum of Understanding between NADBank and EDA so that they work better
        together. This is important to Rep. Torres and the Hispanic Caucus. NADBank/CAIP
        and EDA have done a lot of work together, but it could be an important symbolic
        message to the Hispanic Caucus for the relationship between the two to be formalized.

Announce New Sanctions Policy. You could announce the release of a Presidential Decision
Directive on Sanctions which would establish a joint NECINSC interagency sanctions review
group to monitor and coordinate broad United States government sanctions policy. The group
would ensure that prior to sanctions being implemented the Administration would conduct a
costibenefit analysis. The group could also review existing sanctions in place to determine
whether they are still serving an important purpose in fulfilling our policy objectives. The time
could be ripe for such an announcement because of the keen awareness on the Hill and elsewhere
about the proliferation of new sanctions regimes and their cost to the U.S. economy. An
interagency process has been working on such a directive; work could be finalized in time for an
announcement. Because the Glenn Amendment has crystallized opinion about the problems with
unilateral sanctions, this can and should be done sooner rather than later (i.e., over the next
couple of weeks).

Give Major International Trade Speech. You could articulate U.S. trade objectives for the year
leading up to the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference, which we are hosting. You could also
announce the selection of the city for such an announcement. Over 20 cities have expressed
interest; the conference will bring international attention and over lO,OOO attendees from foreign
government, business, press and NGOs. The policy initiative would be a refinement of the goals
outlined at the May 1998 WTO Anniversary in Geneva.
