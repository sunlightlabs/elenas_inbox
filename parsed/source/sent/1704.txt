MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                    Bruce Reed
                         Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                 DPC Weekly Report

         Welfare -- California Caseload Numbers: New data from California show that
caseloads there have begun to drop steeply. In 1993 and 1994, the welfare rolls rose in the State;
in 1995 and 1996, the caseloads fell, but only by 2 percent and 7 percent respectively. The rate
of decline this year has nearly doubled from last, with caseloads dropping 7 percent in only seven
months. The LA Times carried an article on Thursday noting this caseload "plummet." Twenty
two percent of the nation's welfare recipients live in California.

          Welfare -- Studies on Welfare Reform: We have received some preliminary data from
two studies tracking individuals who left the welfare rolls in Massachusetts and Maryland. The
Massachusetts study found that six months after going off welfare, about 50 percent of these
people were working; about 30 percent had other means of support or had left the state; 9 percent
had children who had grown too old to qualify; and 6 percent were in the process of reapplying
for welfare. The average wage offormer recipients was $6.72 per hour, with the majority of
those employed working in the clerical, sales, health care, and service industries. The Maryland
study similalrly found that 54 percent of former recipients were working within three months of
leaving the rolls and that four-fifths were still off the rolls after six months. The study did not
account for the remaining recipients, but plans to do so in a follow-up report to be released next
year. The study found that welfare recipients with younger children were more likely to return to
the rolls. It found no increase in foster care caseloads as a result of welfare reform.

         Welfare -- Exempting Workfare from FICA Taxes: We have expressed support for
Rep. Shaw's new proposal to exempt workfare participants from FICA and FUTA. Unlike
Shaw's earlier proposals, this one applies only to employment taxes: it does not exempt workfare
participants from minimum wage, health and safety, antidiscrimination, and other worker
protection laws; neither does it undermine the welfare law's work requirements. Governors
strongly support the legislation, though many think it does not go far enough; unions will not
actively oppose it. The Department of Labor has some concern that employers will try to
interpret the FICAIFUT A exemption to coyer not only participants in traditional workfare
programs, but also recipients of subsidized private sector jobs. DPC and the Department agree,
however, that we can address this potential problem through regulation. It is unclear what
vehicle Shaw will use to move his legislation. He tried to add the proposal to a tax technicals bill




                                                                         .      Management System
                                                              Automated Records
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
vote could be taken.

        Welfare -- Senator Murray's Proposal: As you may know, Senator Murray has long
advocated a proposal that would wholly exclude individuals with a history of domestic violence
from the welfare work requirements and time limits. Currently, states can exempt these women
from work requirements and time limits, but still must put 30 percent of their overall caseload to
work and move 80 percent off of welfare after 5 years. Under Senator Murray's approach, if 10
percent ofthe caseload were granted domestic violence waivers, then only 20 percent of the total
caseload would have to work and only 70 percent would be subject to the time limit. This
proposal has passed the Senate several times -- most recently as part of the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill -- but has always been dropped in Conference. Murray now is lobbying the
Administration to make a push for the amendment.

        DPC and HHS have told Murray that we have serious concerns with her approach and
have suggested some alternative language. (We also have made clear that irrespective of any
legislation, we are intending to address this issue in regulations.) We believe that adoption of the
Murray proposal would (I) give states a way to "game" the work rates and time limits by handing
out waivers to people who don't need them two-fold, and (2) allow states to ignore these women,
rather than giving them the services and supports that will help them become self-sufficient. Our
preferred approach is for HHS to excuse states from penalties for failing to meet work rates if the
states show (1) that their failure is attributable to granting temporary waivers to victims of
domestic violence and (2) that they have provided these women with needed services. We
believe that this approach will both limit states' ability to game the system and ensure that states
provide needed services to victims of domestic violence.

         Welfare -- Review of SSA's Children's Disability Determination Process: In a
meeting with you last month, disability advocates expressed concern about the process for
redetermining the eligibility of288,000 children for SSI benefits under the new childhood
disability standard. At that meeting, you stated that you had asked SSA to send you a report on
its process in 30 days. While that meeting was going on, Ken Apfel was testifying at his
confirmation hearing that he would begin a "top-to-bottom" 30-day review of the process as soon
as he was confirmed. He was confirmed a few weeks later. SSA has requested that, instead of
having two overlapping 30-day reviews, we have a single 30-day review beginning from the date
of Apfel's confirmation. Advocates appear to be comfortable with this revised timetable, and we
have approved it.

        Adoption -- Senate Legislation: A bipartisan group of Senators led by Rockefeller
and Chafee and including Craig, Jeffords, Dewine, Bond, Coats, Levin and Landrieu have
announced agreement on child welfare legislation called the P.romotion of Adoption, Safety and
Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act (PASS). As you know, the House passed a
child welfare bill last spring, but Senate action had been stalled. Like the House bill, PASS
incorporates many provisions of your Adoption 2002 proposal. It also includes other measures


                                                 2


                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex.Dwnp Conve~ion
Support Act. The Senate bill, however, also contains a provision that we do not like to "delink"
federal adoption assistance from means-tested programs (effectively providing such assistance
regardless of income). We do not believe this provision will increase the number of adoptions;
in addition, it costs $2.4 billion and is paid for with an offset that the Administration had hoped
to use for other priorities (such as child care). We therefore are working with HHS, OMB, and
the First Lady's Office to develop a less expensive and more sensible proposal that Chafee and
Rockefeller might accept.

        . Education -- Charter Schools Bill: Ten Democrats and fourteen Republicans on the
House Education Committee voted on Thursday to approve amendments to the Charter Schools
Program. The bill would provide incentives to states that allow the number of charter schools to
increase, give charter schools significant autonomy, and periodically review charter schools to
ensure that academic perfonnance requirements are met. The bill also incorporates your goal of
increasing the number of charter schools to 3,000 by the year 2000. Prior to committee action,
the DPC and Department of Education worked with members to make substantial improvements
in the bill. One outstanding issue is that the bill would allow grants to existing charter schools to
continue for five years, potentially reducing start-up funds for new schools and risking long-tenn
dependence on federal funding. We will continue to work with the sponsors, but you can now
give the bill your strong support.

         8. Education: National Tests -- As the Labor/HHS conference proceeds, Obey, Porter
and a number of others have begun to float possible compromises on the national tests. Each of
the proposals presumes that we receive the funds and authority to develop the tests under NAB's
control. They differ primarily with respect to the circumstances under which test implementation
would be pennitted to proceed. Specific proposals include (1) requiring specific Congressional
authorization before implementation; (2) requiring a majority of states to sign up before
implementation could begin; and, (3) making test implementation an allowable state and local
use of Chapter II funds, but providing no specific funding for initial implementation. An option
reflecting a different approach would require that we undertake the R&D to statistically link tests
already used by states and local school districts to the NAEP perfonnance standards so that states
could continue to administer the same tests and provide students with a statistically-derived score
on the national test as well. Most of these alternatives have some clear advantages as well as
clear down sides, with none emerging as a clear favorite for us. We are working to identify
modifications that could strengthen each of them, and to identify additional possibilities as well.
As of yet, none of these has gained any significant backing among conferees, or support from
Goodling.

       Goodling and Ashcroft publicly are hardening their opposition to the tests. Ashcroft has
announced that he.now has 35 Senators lined up in opposition to the tests (though he has not
produced a list of them), up from the 27 he named a week ago. Both Goodling and Ashcroft
have sent Secretary Riley a series of letters continuing to criticize steps the Education
Department had taken prior to its temporary halt on test development.


                                                 3


                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion




                In addition, Goodling announced at Thursday's scheduled mark-up on America Reads that
       he was postponing action on the bill until we reversed our position on national testing. In reality,
       Goodling is under strong pressure from the right wing on his committee not to advance a reading
       bill that reflects our priorities. Consequently, Goodling is now in the position of blocking two
       key steps to improve early reading--higher standards and tests and a reading program that helps
       families, schools and volunteers help kids learn to read.

               On Wednesday, John Doerr, Jim Barkesdale and 4 additional high-tech CEO's met with
       Gingrich, Lott, Goodling, and a number of other Republicans in both houses to urge them to
       support the tests. Feedback from their meetings as well meetings Leg. Affairs has had suggest
       that both Lott and Goodling are urging that a compromise be found.

                10. Health Care: Surgeon General Confirmation -- The Senate Labor and Human
       Resources Committee held its confirmation hearing for Dr. David Satcher this Wednesday. The
       hearing went extremely well, and Senators on both sides of the aisle praised Dr. Satcher. Few
       controversial issues were raised. He was not questioned on many of the high profile issues we
       were expecting, including needle exchange and AIDS research in Africa. It appears likely that
       the final full Senate vote on Dr. Satcher's confirmation will take place as early as the week of
       October 20th.

                11. Health Care: New York Provider Tax -- On Thursday HHS met with Governor
       Pataki and members of the New York delegation as it released its announcement of how the
       Administration will work towards ensuring that all states' provider taxes are in compliance with
       the law. Clearly Governor Pataki chose to portray our response as being completely
       unsatisfactory. This is the case despite the fact that our position on provider taxes is the most
       favorable position we could have taken for New York (and all other states with potentially
       impermissible provider taxes) within the constraints of the law. If this wasn't the case, we would
       not be having to ask for legislation to give the Secretary authority she does not now have to
       waive up to all past liability for currently impermissible taxes. It is further validated by those
       staff members of the House Committee of Jurisdiction (who hate provider taxes) who are
       criticizing us for being too favorable to New York and resentful that we are pushing a legislative
       strategy. All things considered, however, we believe that our positioning on this issue is as well
       as could be hoped for and most realistically positions us to eventually and most expeditiously
       ensure that all states come into compliance.

               13. Health Care: Kassebaum-Kennedy Implementation -- As you know, there was a
       story in The New York Times last Sunday that reported that some insurers are giving agents
       incentives to not enroll high-risk populations. Such actions are completely inconsistent with the
       spirit of the Kassebaum-Kennedy law. We are meeting with HCFA, the agency responsible for
       administering this provision of the new law, to review all of the Federal and State statutory
       authority to stop such practices. We will keep you apprised as we move forward.




                                                        4


                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, your new appointment for HCFA Administrator, has had two Senate
holds placed on her confirmation. Senator Harkin (D-IA) has placed a hold because of his
frustration with the Administration's lack of enforcement of his fraud and abuse priority
initiatives. Senator Kyl (R-AZ) has just placed a hold apparently because of his concern about
the Administration's opposition to his amendment to reopen up the balanced budget act to allow
physicians negotiate private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries.

       On Wednesday Nancy-Ann met with Senator Harkin's staff and made a commitment to
address many of the Senator's priorities. The Senator and his staff seemed quite pleased and it
appears likely that Harkin will soon release his hold. Since Senator Kyl's hold was placed on
Thursday of this week, we have not had the opportunity to arrange an acceptable arrangement to
remove his hold. We are still conducting a thorough policy review on the Kyl Amendment, but
are concerned that it could lead to more fraud and abuse in Medicare and dramatically increase
beneficiary out-of-pocket costs.

         We believe that the fact that Nancy-Ann has not been confirmed undermines her ability to
be as effective as possible in administering one of the most complex and complicated agencies in
the Federal government. We have and will continue to make her confirmation one of our highest
priorities this fall.
