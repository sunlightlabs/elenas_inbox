                                       Talking Points on FLSA
                                                 5/16/97

          The Labor Department has concluded that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) applies
           to welfare recipients in workfare or other subsidized employment programs in the same
           way as that law applies to all other employees.

          This means that many, if not most, welfare recipients in theseprograms will receive at
           least the minimum wage for their work activities.

          Welfare recipients in these programs will not have to be paid the minimum wage if they
           fall within the FLSA's exception for "trainees." Some states will probably try to structure
           their workfare programs so that recipients fall within the "trainee" exception.

          In most cases in which the minimum wage is required, both cash assistance and food
           stamps will count toward the minimum wage. The Department of Agriculture will take
           necessary administrative action to ensure that food stamps can be counted to the greatest
           degree possible.

          This will not affect the work requirements of the welfare law. States will still be able to
           meet those requirements, not only by putting recipients in workfare, but by placing people
           in private sector jobs (where the minimum wage already applies). With both cash
           assistance and food stamps counting toward the minimum wage, very few states will have
           to increase their assistance payments. In fact every state but one (Mississippi) can
           comply with the welfare law's current work requirements (now 20 hours per week for a
           welfare recipient) and pay minimum wage without increasing their current benefit level.

          The Labor Department will provide guidance within the next week or two on the specifics
           of this policy and will engage in extensive consultation with states on how to apply this
           policy with the least disruption.

          The Treasury Department is still exploring how the tax laws apply to welfare recipients in
           workfare programs. We hope to be able to give states an answer to that question very
           shortly.




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion




                                               Q&A


     Question:   Won't this end welfare reform as we know it by making work more expensive?

     Answer:    Not at all. With both T ANF and food stamps counting toward the minimum
                 wage, every state except Mississippi will be able to give welfare recipients
                 workfare slots for 20 hours each week (the welfare law's current work
                 requirement) without raising their benefit levels. And of course states should be
                 trying to place welfare recipients in private sector jobs where the minimum wage
                 already applies.


     Question:   Are most welfare recipients who are working going to be considered
                 "employees"?

     Answer:     Most welfare recipients participating in the work activities described in the new
                 welfare law probably will count as "employees," entitled to the minimum wage,
                 under the FLSA. But some individuals, engaged in such activities as job search,
                 vocational education, and secondary school, may count as "trainees" instead. The
                 Labor Department will advise states on how the FLSA applies to particular
                 programs and individuals engaged in them.


     Question:   What's the difference between a trainee and a worker under FLSA?

     Answer:     An individual is in training if:
                       Training is similar to that given in a vocational school;
                       Training is for the benefit of the trainee;
                       Trainees do not displace regular workers;
                       The employer derives no immediate advantage from the trainees' activites;
                       Trainees are not entitled to ajob after training is completed; or
                 .     The employer and trainee understand that the trainee is not paid.


     Question:   Can Food Stamps count as wages?

     Answer:     We believe that through waivers or other mechanisms such as the Simplified Food
                 Program option now in law, states will be able to count food stamps toward the
                 minimum wage for all those required to work under the new welfare law.

                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
            programs can unionize?

Answer:     No -- that is a different question entirely. Whether and when workers can
            unionize is a function of the National Labor Relations Act. The National Labor
            Relations Board, an independent entity that administers that Act, has not ruled on
            the unionization question.
