                                      May 8, 1999

In his radio address to the nation, the President will unveil new proposals to help make our
schools safer and drug-free including initiatives to: require counseling for students who bring
firearms and bombs to school, promote programs that educate students on the risks associated
with firearms, and allow more education funds to be spent on alternative schools, character
education, and other programs. These proposals will be included in the Administration's
proposal to reauthorize the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA), which
will be transmitted to Congress next week. In addition, the President will call on the
Departments of Education and Justice to work together and provide funds to facilitate
information sharing on troubled youth between schools and other agencies.

Improving school response to kids bringing weapons to school. The President's Safe and Drug-
Free Schools proposal will contain a number of measures to help schools prevent and respond to
kids who bring weapons to school. Specifically, the proposal will:

      Require counseling for gun-toting students. Under current law, schools are generally
       required to expel any student who brings a gun or explosive device to school, as well as
       to report that student to local law enforcement o-fficials and juvenile justice authorities.
       During the 1996-97 school year, this national policy of "zero tolerance" for guns resulted
       in more than 6,000 students being expelled from school. Under the President's new
       proposal, schools will now also be required to refer every student who brings a gun on to
       campus to a mental health professional for assessment. If the student is determined to
       pose an imminent threat to himself or others, he will be required to receive appropriate
       treatment before being permitted to return to school.

      Support programs that educate students about risks associated with guns. Although
       the current SDFSCA Program funds a broad range of drug and violence prevention
       programs, gun safety education programs are generally not funded. The President's new
       initiative will allow funding for programs that educate students about the risks and
       possible consequences associated with firearms and helps them to make safe choices and
       avoid injuries.

Dealing with disruptive students and helping to instill common sense values.

      Facilitate information sharing on troubled youth. Maintaining a safe school
       environment requires the forging of partnerships to share information between schools
       and other agencies that serve young people -- such as police departments, courts, and
       youth parole and probation offices. The President will instruct the Departments of Justice
       and Education to work together to identify more effective mechanisms for sharing
       information consistent with current law, and to provide $1 million for training and
       technical assistance on information sharing to educators, law enforcement, juvenile
       justice authorities, and social service providers.


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  HeX-Dump Conversion
       disrupt classes and engage in fights make it more difficult for teachers to teach and for
       other students to learn. The President's SDFSCA initiative will provide additional
       funding incentives to allow schools to fund "second chance" programs that enforce clear,
       consistent discipline codes; require counseling for problem students; and separate
       chronically disruptive and violent kids from the rest of the class by placing them in
       alternative schools and other similar programs. The President's FY 2000 budget also
       includes $9 million for the development of model programs and strategies that establish
       consequences for disruptive students while keeping them on track academically.

      Expand character education programs. Current law prevents the Secretary of
       Education from making more than 10 grants per year for character education programs,
       and limits overall funding for each state to $1 million over a 5-year period. The President
       will recommend lifting these restrictions so that more states can implement character
       education programs that help instill common sense values in our children.

Helping communities respond to school shootings. The President's Safe and Drug Free .
Schools reauthorization will contain his Project SERV initiative -- developed with the help of the
communities impacted by recent schools shootings -- to provide immediate assistance as soon as
a school-related violent or traumatic incident occurs, through:

      A $12 million Emergency Response Fund to help communities meet urgent and
       unplanned needs, such as additional security personnel, emergency mental health crisis
       counseling, and longer-term counseling to students, faculty, and their families. Officials
       from the Departments of Justice, Education, HHS, and FEMA worked together to help
       schools impacted by last year's shootings. These agencies will continue to work together
       as part of Project SERV, and improve ongoing federal crisis response efforts.

      Crisis response experts identified and funded by the Departments of Education, Justice,
       Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Federal Emergency Management
       Administration (FEMA), who can help local officials identify and respond to community
       needs, help in developing a plan to address those needs, and assist in locating necessary
       financial and human resources.

The New Safe, Disciplined, and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program
The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program represents the federal government's
largest effort to prevent youth drug use and school violence. At the White House Conference on
School Safety, the President proposed overhauling the SDFSC program to provide more effective
prevention programs for the reduction of drugs and violence in schools, more accountability for
results, and better targeting to those schools that need the most assistance. Under the President's
new Safe, Disciplined, and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program, school districts will
be expected to develop comprehensive plans that:

       Adopt and enforce, clear and fair discipline polices, such as zero tolerance polices for
       guns and drugs, school uniforms, closed campus policies, and parent notification and


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

      Establish security procedures for schools which could include the use of metal
      detectors and to implement formal agreements with law enforcement officials to patrol
      school grounds and pathways to school.

      Provide effective anti-drug and violence prevention programs, including research-
      based, proven effective programs that teach responsible decision-making, mentoring,
      mediation, or other activities aimed at changing behaviors.

      Increase accountability by collecting data and reporting results to the public
      through annual report cards on the number and type of school-related drug and/or
      violence incidents.

      Assess and intervene for troubled youth through procedures to identify students for
      evaluation and counseling; training for teachers and staff; and providing linkages
      between district officials, mental health, and other community professionals where
      appropriate.

      Connect students to responsible adults in the community through after-school activities
      to extend the school day or mentoring programs, to keep students away from drugs
      and violence -- and out of trouble.

      Develop a plan for crisis management that responds to traumatic incidents on school
      grounds, such as shootings on school grounds or drug overdoses.

Building on a Record ofAccomplishment

     Funding comprehensive school safety efforts. The President's Safe Schools-Healthy
      Students initiative represents an unprecedented collaboration between the Departments of
      Justice, Education, and HHS to allow 50 communities to receive up to $3 million for each
      of the next three years to adopt comprehensive, community-wide approaches to violence
      and drug prevention. Through this $380 million initiative, communities will receive
      assistance to fund school counselors and other mental health services, metal detectors,
      officers for schools, and after school and conflict resolution programs by the start of the
      1999-2000 school year. The President's Safe and Drug-Free Schools reauthorization
      proposal will help schools to engage in comprehensive community-wide efforts like the
      Safe-Schools initiative.

     Adding more law enforcement to prevent crime, violence, and drugs in schools.
      School resource officers provide schools with on-site security and a direct link to law
      enforcement agencies. Last month, President Clinton announced $70 million in Justice
      Department COPS Office grants to hire more than 600 police officers in schools in 336
      communities across the country. This was the first installment in meeting the President's
      pledge made at the White House Conference on School Safety to provide funds for up to
