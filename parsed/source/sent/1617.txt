                    Access and Licensing

                            The access and licensing provisions of the settlement significantly enhance the ability of
                    the government to prevent youth access to tobacco products. The current FDA rule establishes
                    18 as the federal minimum age of sale, requires retailers to check photo identification of anyone
                    under 27, and eliminates free samples and the sale of single cigarettes. The proposed settlement
                    incorporates these access restrictions while also banning all cigarette vending machines and
                    requiring tobacco products to be placed out of reach of consumers in ariy facility that children
                    may enter. Even more important, the settlement would establish a retail licensing scheme to
                    enforce these access restrictions. FDA and Treasury agree that such a system is necessary for
                    adequate enforcement of youth access provisions. Assuming adequate funding, legislation
                    creating a licensing system could count as one of the principal virtues of the settlement
                    agreement.

                            As written, however, the licensing provision of the settlement contains some important
                    ambiguities. Most critically, the settlement is vague as to who -- state authorities, federal
                    authorities, or some combination of the two -- will administer the licensing scheme. We are not
                    yet in a position to make a final recommendation on this question. FDA's current inclination is
                    to give responsibility for running the scheme to the states, but to retain the power to revoke
                    licenses. We are not yet sure whether such an approach would work (or even how it could be
                    done); rather than recommending a specific scheme, we should commit only to working with
                    Congress and the Attorneys General on this question.

                            The licensing provision also now contains an inadequate penalty structure. Most
                    troublesome, the settlement provides for permanent license revocation only after a licensee's
                    tenth offense within two years. Because licensing officials are unlikely to conduct ten
                    compliance checks on a single retailer in a two-year time frame, this provision is essentially
                    meaningless. We should insist on strengthening the penalty scheme -- including by making
                    mandatory revocation a real weapon -- without getting into a level of detail unsuitable at this
                    stage of the process.

                            These provisions are not particularly high-profile. They have not attracted much
                    attention, and nothing we say about them will alter the politics of the deal in either direction. But
                    the provisions, if strengthened and clarified along the lines suggested, could prove one of the
                    great virtues of accepting a settlement.



                    Marketing, Advertising, and Labeling

                             The advertising and marketing restrictions in the settlement are very strong. They include
                    all the restrictions in the FDA rule -- most notably, requirements of black-on-white advertising
                    and bans on tobacco brand names in non-tobacco merchandise. The district court struck down
                    these restrictions as inconsistent with the FDA's statutory authority. The Court of Appeals
                    clearly will not reverse this decision, and the Supreme Court probably will leave it alone as well.


                                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
rule, such as restrictions on point-of-sale advertising and bans on outdoor advertising, Internet
advertising, the use of human images and cartoon characters, and payments for tobacco product
placement in movies and other media. Congress could not enact such restrictions consistent with
the Constitution.

           The Department of Justice believes that these restrictions on advertising should not be
  part of any legislation, but only of the consent decrees or other contracts entered into by the
  industry and Attorneys General. To the extent the restrictions are a part of the legislation -- or
  seen as a condition of the legislation -- serious constitutional issues will arise. To the extent the
  restrictions are a part only ofthe settlement agreements, they probably will be permissible as
. voluntary relinquishments of rights.

         Assuming we follow the Justice Department's recommendation, serious questions
relating to enforcement of the advertising restrictions arise. We know that each Attorney General
will be able to enforce the restrictions in his or her state. But what of states in which there is no
consent decree? Or what of states with inattentive Attorneys General? The proposed settlement
agreement makes reference to a "national protocol" -- a contract of some kind designed to
enhance enforcement of the advertising restrictions (and other provisions) in the consent decrees.
 But no two of the parties (let alone mere readers ofthe agreement) have precisely the same idea
of who will sign the protocol or how it will work in practice. We must keep a close eye on this
scheme -- ·and on any legislative references to it -- to ensure that it provides an effective
mechanism for enforcing the advertising restrictions while not increasing the vulnerability of the
restrictions to constitutional challenge (by making their enforcement something other than a
simple matter of contract law).

        We also should insist on statutory confirmation of FDA authority over the advertising and
marketing of tobacco products. This grant of authority is valuable even though the settlement
agreements will go further than the FDA could, precisely because the FDA will have no authority
to enforce the contracts between the industry and the states. With a specific grant of authority,
the FDA itself could enforce the restrictions contained in its 1996 rule, as well as any other
constitutionally permissible restrictions it might wish to impose in the future. Such a provision
should be acceptable to all parties.

         In addition to including restrictions on advertising, the settlement contains provisions to
require "Canadian-style" warning labels -- i.e., strengthened warnings (such as "cigarettes cause
cancer" and "smoking can kill you") that appear on 25% of the fiont or display panel of tobacco
products, printed in alternating black-on-white or white-on-black type. These provisions would
strengthen significantly the existing warning labels, both in the starkness of the message and in
its size and placement on tobacco products. We do not recommend any changes to them.




Liability and Other Legal Issues
liability. The settlement limits total liability to $5 billion each year (with any unspent portion of
a base $4 billion fund reverting to the government), prohibits class action and other joinder
devices, and eliminates punitive damage claims (but requires a payment of more than $20 billion
in punitive damages directly payable to the public). There is little doubt about the value of these
provisions to the tobacco companies. [Do we have estimates from Treasury about what the
value is, based on stock prices, etc?)

         On the other hand, it is not at all clear that these provisions harm public health interests.
Instituting a comprehensive regulatory scheme, while keeping in place the possibility of $5
billion in annual compensatory damages ($5 billion more than the industry has ever paid before),
shouid influence future corporate behavior at least as weB as the litigation syslem usually
manages to do. Moreover, making the companies pay a punitive damage award for past
misconduct to the public (for use in health research, etc.) makes far more sense from a public
health perspective than allowing such funds to go as windfalls to individual plaintiffs. Of course,
these provisions do decrease the likelihood of bankrupting the tobacco companies. But as long
as Americans are addicted to tobacco products, it is very unclear that this result would serve the
public health; indeed, the exact opposite argument is at least equally plausible.

         We should further advance public health interests by insisting on the removal of any
limits on punitive damages for future misconduct. We would make clear that plaintiffs can seek
such awards, and that these awards shall not count toward or be subject to yearly limits. The
continued potential for unrestricted punitive damages will support the regulatory aspects of the
legislation in deterring willful misconduct and otherwise changing corporate behavior. At the
same time, this change will enable the legal system to punish the industry, over and above
compensatory damages, for any future misbehavior. The industry can hardly argue against this
change to the settlement agreement.

        We might also consider whether to draw the line at prohibition of class actions, while
allowing plaintiffs to use other joinder devices. The Justice Department would be more
comfortable with this limited prohibition, on the ground that [awaiting statement from Justice).
 The industry claims it will not accept such a modification (though given the cap on damages, it
is hard to see why this change would matter so much to the industry). More important, [awaiting
statement from Bruce re why this isn't such a good idea).

        The FTC and Antitrust Division of the Justice Department are both concerned about the
breadth of the antitrust exemption contained in the proposed settlement agreement, noting that it
might protect such activities as price-fixing, mergers to monopoly, predatory pricing, and
agreements not to produce reduced-risk products. The FTC and Antitrust Division have not
come to closure on exact language to include in legislation, but agree that the exemption should
allow collusion only for the purpose of reducing youth smoking (by uniformly passing on the
costs of the settlement and penalties and agreeing on advertising restrictions). [Bruce -- is this
right?) We should insist on a narrowing of the antitrust exemption, but not yet propose specific
language. The industry almost certainly will accept this change.

aspects -- muddled, internally contradictory, and seemingly senseless. We should try to clarify
them so that they preserve current FDA authority, while enabling states in appropriate
circumstances to go beyond the provisions of the settlement agreement. More specifically, where
existing law requires states to petition the FDA to regulate tobacco, states would remain under
that obligation and the FDA would retain its current authority; where existing law allows states to
regulate tobacco on their own, states could impose any regulations more stringent than the new
federal standards. It is very difficult to know how much (if at all) this scheme deviates from
what the drafters of the settlement intended. In any case, it is hard to imagine that the issue
would drive any party from the table.
