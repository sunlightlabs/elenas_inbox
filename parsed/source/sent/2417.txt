      Here is a draft of the one-pager; it reflects comments from Chow, Shireman
      and Broderick Johnson, though they are seeing this draft at the same time
      you are.  It's a pretty good first approximation, but still needs some
      work, and should be vetted with Daschle and Gephardt's staff at some point.

    Draft
                     ONE DAY FOR AMERICA'S SCHOOLS: ONE DAY ONE VOTE


    ONE DAY FOR AMERICA'S SCHOOLS. President Clinton will urge Congress--before it
    goes home in two short weeks--to help ensure every American student receives a world-class
    education. Joined by Vice President Gore and more than 20 Congressional Democrats,
    President Clinton will urge the Congress to set aside one of the few remaining days this year to
    vote on and pass his education agenda to reduce class size to a national average of 18, modernize
    5,000 schools nationwide, and make the needed investments to provide schools and students with
    after-school programs, technology, and other tools to bring our schools into the 21st century.

               Smaller Classes With Well-Prepared Teachers. President Clinton will urge Congress
                to pass the Class Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Act, his proposal to provide $12
                billion over 7 years to help local communities hire 100,000 teachers and reduce class size
                to a national average of 18 in grades 1-3. Studies show that smaller classes help teachers
                provide more personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline, and help
                students to learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills.

               Modern Schools for the 21st Century. President Clinton will urge Congress to pass his
                School Modernization initiative, which will provide local communities with $22 billion
                in interest-free bonds to help renovate, modernize and build over 5,000 schools
                nationwide to reduce overcrowding, fix leaky roofs, and make schools safer.

               Critical Investments in After-School Programs, Education Technology and Basic
                Education. President Clinton will urge the Congress to fully fund his FY 1999 budget
                request to strengthen public schools by raising standards, increasing accountability,
                expanding public school choice, strengthening teaching and learning and keeping our
                schools safe and drug free.

                       After-School programs for academic enrichment and extra help in a safe,
                       supervised environment. The President's budget would provide after-school
                       opportunities to more than 425,000 [check number] students, with important
                       tutoring, academic enrichment programs, supervised recreation and
                       community service opportunities in safe, drug-free environments.

                       Education Technology. The President has made an unprecedented
                       committment to bringing technology to the classroom and called for
                       technology training for teachers and expanded access for teachers and
                       students to computers in the classroom.

                       Strengthening Public Schools. Overall, the House Labor/HHS
                       appropriations bill is $2 billion below the President's funding request, and
                       fails to make critical investments needed to raise academic standards, help
                       young children learn to read and all students master the basics, keep our


                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

        schools drug free, and give disadvantaged students and their families
        pathways to college. While the Senate bill rejects the extreme cuts made by
        the House, it is still X billion below the President's request, and shortchanges
        programs that help young children learn to read, help children become
        proficient in English and learn academic subjects, establish innovative
        Charter Schools, and keep middle schools safe and drug~free.
