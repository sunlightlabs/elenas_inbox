MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

THROUGH:                 Erskine Bowles

FROM:                    Bruce Reed
                         Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                 Tobacco Idea

         Dick Scruggs called us yesterday with an idea for how to achieve our goals on tobacco
without legislation. We have discussed this idea with Erskine, and all of us believe that it is very
interesting. If you agree that Scruggs's suggestion is worth pursuing, Erskine will take the steps
necessary to do so. Until he does, we should not raise this idea with anyone else.

        Scruggs proposes that the federal government enter into a consent decree with the tobacco
companies to settle our claims for Medicare costs. As a matter of mechanics, we probably would
do this by filing two documents simultaneously with a court: a complaint against the companies
and a proposed settlement agreement.

        Under Scruggs's proposed consent decree, the companies would make the payments
called for in the June 20th settlement agreement -- i.e., $368 billion plus capped industry-wide
lookbacks. About $200 billion of this amount would go to states settling their own suits against
the companies, with the remainder going to the federal government. Any state that wished to
continue its suit against the companies could do so, but the state's share of the money then would
revert to the federal government. Scruggs had no view on whether the states should have to use
some portion of their money for specified purposes (~, child care). He did note that the federal
government would have to leave the full $200 billion with the states, rather than seek to
recapture its usual share of Medicaid recoveries.

         In addition to containing these monetary provisions, the consent decree would require the
companies to drop their legal challenge to the FDA rule and to accept the FDA's assertion of
jurisdiction over tobacco products. The decree also would mandate that the companies adhere to
all the youth access and advertising restrictions contained in the June 20th settlement agreement.


       The consent decree of course could not give the companies the liability protections
contemplated in the June 20th agreement; for that, an act of Congress is necessary. Scruggs
suggests, however, that the decree contain some kind of set-off or credit for punitive damages.
Under the scheme he proposes, a company could subtract from its required payment to a state any


                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

punitive damages awarded against the company in that state's courts, up to the full amount of the
required payment. Scruggs believes that the states will go along with this provision, even though
it appears to put everything they get out of the settlement at some risk (at least if their courts
award punitive damages).

        Scruggs also proposes that the consent decree give the settling companies some kind of
protection against new entrants to the tobacco market (or existing companies with tiny market
shares). This protection, according to Scruggs, is necessary to alleviate the fear of the companies
that agreeing to this settlement will allow new companies to undercut them. Although Scruggs is
uncertain about precisely how to provide this protection, he suggests that the FDA agree to
regulate settling companies somewhat differently from other companies -- for example, by
agreeing not to ban products manufactured by settling companies, but retaining authority to ban
products manufactured by all others.

        Erskine and we believe that as outlined here and putting aside all legal questions, the
settlement is deficient in two respects. First, the settlement does not include any protection for
farmers. We could solve this problem by insisting that the companies agree to purchase a set
amount of tobacco leaf each year from American farmers. Second, the settlement seems slightly
underfunded. We need to get something -- even ifnot much -- more than the original $368
billion (perhaps the $428 in Senator Hatch's bill) to sell this settlement as a huge victory.

        Even more important, we will have to address a number of legal issues before we can
enter into this kind of settlement. First, we will have to figure out a legal way of giving about
$200 billion in settlement monies to the states; this provision potentially conflicts with the
federal government's obligation to' place legal awards in the U.S. Treasury for later appropriation
by Congress or with the federal government's obligation to recoup a portion of state Medicaid
recoveries. Second, we will have to find a sure way to protect the FDA rule; the settling
companies' agreement to drop their suit is insufficient if other parties (~, retailers, advertisers,
other manufacturers) can continue the suit, or bring a very similar suit the next morning. Third,
we will have to inspect very closely any proposals to give a competitive advantage to settling
companies, in light of both our antitrust policies and our regulatory objectives.

        All that said, we think this approach presents us with an exciting opportunity. According
to Scruggs, key Wall Street analysts have told him that the industry might well be interested in
this kind of deal. (Scruggs claims not to have talked with industry officials.) We think you
should give Erskine the go-ahead to send out some feelers.

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

 What the companies give:

       $368+ billion ($428?), of which about $200 billion goes to states (less if some states opt
        out); money to states is free and clear of all federal recoupment claims

       Industry-wide lookbacks

       All advertising and access restrictions in June 20th agreement

       Withdrawal of legal challenge to FDA rule; action to prevent other parties from
        continuing current suit or bringing new one (but how?)

      Undetermined protection for or payment to tobacco farmers

 What the companies get:

       Settlement of federal suit and state suits (unless state opts out of money)

      Credit for punitive damages against payments to states -- ~, if Mississippi court grants
       private plaintiff $1 0 million in punitive damages, companies pay $10 million less to
       Mississippi

      Undetermined market protection against non-settling companies (including new entrants)
       -- ~, distinctions in way FDA regulates settling and non-settling parties




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

SUBJECT:                 Tobacco

        Attached is a one-pager to give to the Attorney General. As you can see, I have labeled
the proposed agreement the "Scruggs Proposal"; if you would prefer me to describe it differently,
please let me know.

        Two further thoughts occurred to me as I was writing up the one-pager. First, we must
figure out whether our trade obligations prevent us from entering into certain kinds of agreements
to protect farmers (~, an agreement by the companies to buy a set amount from American
farmers). Second, we should consider whether the punitive damage set-off suggested by Scruggs
will lead states to adopt laws prohibiting the award of punitive damages against tobacco
companies, thus providing the companies with the protection they long have wanted against
punitive damages.                                                        '

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
