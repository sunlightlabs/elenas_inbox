                                     February 14, 1998

                                 The National Drug Control Strategy's Five Goals




      Goal I:    Educate and enable America's youth to reject illegal drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco.
      Goal 2:    Increase the safety of America's citizens by substantially reducing drug-related crime and violence.
      Goal 3:    Reduce health and social costs to the public of illegal drug use.
      Goal 4:    Shield America's air, land, and sea frontiers from the drug threat.
      Goal 5:    Break foreign and domestic drug sources of supply.




Announcement: In his radio address to the nation, President Clinton released: (1) the 1998 National
Drug Control Strategy, a comprehensive ten-year plan to reduce drug use and availability by half -- a
historic new low. The plan is backed by a $17 billion counter-drug budget -- the largest ever presented
to Congress, with an increase of a billion dollars over last year's budget; and (2) the results of a
Department of Justice study showing that Administration efforts to test and treat federal prisoners are
working. The study found that prisoners who participated in the Bureau of Prisons residential testing
and treatment program were 73% less likely to be re-arrested and 44% less likely to use drugs again.

Protecting America's Kids. The first goal of the Strategy is to educate and enable kids to reject drugs.
 Although current studies show that youth drug use rates may have started to decline, they remain
unacceptably high. The Strategy gives parents the tools and support they need to teach their children
that drugs are wrong, and can kill you. That is why the largest percentage increase in drug funding
(15%) is for programs that target youth, including:

      $195 Million National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign to make sure that when kids tum on
       the television, surf the "net," or listen to the radio, they learn about the dangers of drugs.

      $50 Million for School Drug Prevention Coordinators to improve and expand the Safe and
       Drug-Free Schools program by hiring more than 1,000 new prevention professionals to work
       with schools in preventing drug use.

Shielding Our Borders. The Strategy will shut the door on drugs at the border by committing more
manpower and resources to fighting drugs. The Strategy includes:

      $163 Million for Border Patrol to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol officers and for "force
       multiplying" technology.

      $54 Million for Advanced Technology for the Customs Service to deploy advanced
       technologies, such as X-ray systems and remote video surveillance.



                                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
       Mexican counterdrug forces.
Strengthening Law Enforcement. The Strategy calls for increasing the safety of our citizens by
reducing drug-related crime and violence. New initiatives include:

      $38 Million to Crack Down on Methamphetamine and Heroin by hiring 100 new DEA agents,
       expanding the Administration's anti-methamphetamine initiative, and targeting heroin
       traffickers.

Breaking the Cycle of Drugs and Crime. The study released by the Department of Justice today
confirms that the President's policy of coerced abstinence -- or testing and treating drug offenders -- is
working. The study found that of 1;866 prisoners in 30 different federal prisons, those that
participated in a comprehensive drug testing and treatment program were 73% less likely to be re-
arrested and 44% less likely to use drugs again in the first six months after their release. That is why
the Strategy calls for new funds to help states and local jurisdictions adopt coerced abstinence policies.
 It includes:

      $85 Million to Promote Coerced Abstinence to help state and local governments implement
       drug testing, treatment, and graduated sanctions for drug offenders.

Closing the Treatment Gap. Drug dependence exacts an enormous cost on individuals, families,
businesses, communities, and the nation. Treatment can help to end this dependence and reduce the
destructive consequences of drug use. This year's strategy includes:

      A $200 Million Increase for Substance Abuse Block Grants to help states close the treatment
       gap.

Enhancing Multinational Cooperation. The Strategy calls for continued U.S. leadership and
assistance to strengthen the international anti-drug consensus, including:

      $45 Million for International Programs for the Department of State to support nations involved
       in interdiction and counterdrug law enforcement.

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
                                   Questions and Answers
                                    February 14, 1998


1998 National Drug Strategy

Q.    What is the President announcing today? What are the highlights of the new
      strategy?

A.    In his radio address to the nation, President Clinton released the 1998 National Drug
      Control Strategy, a comprehensive ten-year plan to reduce drug use and availability by
      50% -- to a historic new low. The ten-year plan is backed by a $17 billion counter-drug
      budget, the largest ever presented to Congress, with an increase of a billion dollars over
      last year's budget.

      Protecting Kids:
            $195 Million National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign to make sure that when
             kids tum on the television or surf the "net," they learn about the dangers of drugs.
            $50 Million for School Drug Prevention Coordinators to improve and expand the
             Safe and Drug-Free Schools program by hiring more than 1,000 new prevention
             professionals to work with schools in preventing drug use.

      Strengthening Our Borders:
            $163 Million for Border Patrol to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol officers and for
             "force multiplying" technology.
            $54 Million for Advanced Technology for the Customs Service to deploy
            advanced technologies, such as X-ray systems and remote video surveillance.
           $75.4 Million to Support Interdiction Efforts in the Andean region and Caribbean,
                                                          and to train Mexican counterdrug
                                                          forces.

      Strengthening Law Enforcement:
            $38 Million to Crack Down on Methamphetamine and Heroin by hiring 100 new
            DEA agents, expanding the Administration's anti-methamphetamine initiative,
             and targeting heroin traffickers.

      Breaking the Cycle of Drugs and Crime:
           $85 Million to Promote Coerced Abstinence to help state and local governments
            implement drug testing, treatment, and graduated sanctions for drug offenders.

           $45 Million for International Programs for the Department of State to support
            nations involved in interdiction and counterdrug law enforcement.




                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
           $200 Million Increase for Substance Abuse Block Grants to help states close the
            treatment gap.

Q.   Doesn't your budget fall short of what is needed to implement your strategy and the
     corresponding performance measures?

A.   No. The President's FY 99 budget supports the goals and objectives of the National Drug
     Control Strategy through increases in areas identified as funding priorities. The proposed
     FY 99 anti-drug budget is $17 .I톌illion-- $1.1 billion, or seven percent more than in FY
     98. Our budget provides increases for all five goals of the Strategy, including drug
     treatment and prevention, domestic law enforcement, interdiction, and international
     programs. The budget provides the largest increase (15%) for the first goal of the
     national Strategy: to educate and enable our youth to reject illegal drugs as well as alcohol
     and tobacco.

     Moreover, the budget is structured to enable the federal government to work with its
     State, local, foreign, and private partners in making progress towards the targets and
     performance measures contemplated in the Strategy and the performance measurement
     system. The performance measures should be viewed as goals for the nation -- not just
     the Federal government alone.

Q.   What is the Strategy?

A.   By law, the Office of National Drug Control Policy must provide the Congress with an
     annual report of the President's national drug control strategy and budget. There have
     been eight prior versions of the strategy.


Q.   What are the performance measures?

A.   The performance measures respond to a public call for results-oriented government. This
     means increased accountability and improved performance from our total drug control
     efforts. At the core of the performance measurement system are twelve targets that define
     specific results to be achieved by the Strategy's five goals. Over the long term, the
     performance measures will show the effectiveness of specific Federal, state, and local
     counterdrug programs.

     The primary targets are a 50% reduction of drug use and availability, and at least a
     25% reduction in damaging drug use consequences <!::..g., crime rates associated with
     drug trafficking, health and social costs) over the next 10 years.

     These targets were developed in consultation with federal drug-control agencies and
     reviewed by state and local agencies as well as drug-control experts.



                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
      Did you pick a ten year marker since President Clinton will no longer be in office by
      that time?

A.   We believe that we can cut drug use in half over ten years in large part because we have
     already done so. From 1979 to 1996, the number of people using drugs dropped by 49
     percent, and the number using cocaine dropped by 70 percent. The critical part of
     meeting this goal is preventing the next generation of young people from ever starting to
     use drugs. If we can do this, we will achieve the goal.

     The ten-year marker reflects the fact that there is no quick fix to America's drug problem.
      Studies show that drug use patterns occur within generational cycles -- drug use falls off,
     and unless there is ongoing education, young people forget the dangers of drugs. The ten-
     year focus reflects the need for an enduring commitment. It is important to note that the
     performance markers include interim benchmarks -- to check on the efficacy of our
     efforts before the end of the ten-year period.


Prison Drug Testing/Treatment

Q.       What does the Justice Department study say about the effectiveness of prison
         drug treatment?

A.       According to a study from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), Federal inmates who
         participated in the BOP residential drug abuse treatment program during their
         incarceration were less likely to be re-arrested or to become involved in further drug
         use following their release. The study involved 1,866 inmates at more than 30
         institutions.

         Specifically, the study found that Federal inmates who completed the residential
         substance abuse treatment program were 73 percent less likely to be re-arrested and
         44% less likely test positive for drugs in the first 6 months after release than similar
         inmates who did not receive this treatment.

Q.       What is the residential drug abuse treatment program in the federal prison
         system?

A.       The residential drug abuse treatment program is a comprehensive program that gives
         inmates up to 500 hours of treatment while in prison, and includes participation in
         community transitional services when the inmate is transferred to a halfway house
         prior to release. The treatment focuses on individual responsibility and changing
         future behavior. Currently, the BOP operates 42 residential treatment programs, with
         an annual capacity of over 6,000 participants.




                                                                    Automated Records Management system
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

A.   Last month, the President signed a directive to the Attorney General calling on her to
     take the necessary steps to:

     (I) Require states to determine the level of drug use in their prisons and report
     annually on their progress.
     (2) Give states the flexibility to use their federal prison funds for drug detection,
     offender testing, and drug treatment.
     (3) Work with states to enact stiffer penalties for drug trafficking into and within
     correctional facilities.

     Moreover, the President's FY 99 budget will include $197 million for a series of
     initiatives to promote coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system
     -- including $85 million for a new drug testing and sanctions program for states and
     localities.

     In addition, the President has taken numerous other actions to combat the problem of
     drug abuse by offenders involved in the criminal justice system including: doubling
     the number of federal arrestees drug tested in 24 judicial districts; fighting to launch a
     $1 billion initiative to spread Drug Courts across the country; and expanding drug
     testing, intervention, and treatment in Federal prisons through his budgets and the
     1994 Crime Act.

Q.   Besides treatment, what are you doing about the drug problem in federal
     prisons?

A.   Under the leadership of Attorney General Reno, the federal Bureau of Prisons is
     carrying out model programs in drug testing, drug treatment, and drug detection.

     Drug Testing. In 1997, federal inmates were subject to 127,460 drug tests. Two
     percent of tests were positive, as compared to the 9 percent average for state
     correctional systems. Prisoners testing positive for drugs are appropriately punished
     and follow up tests are scheduled regularly to ensure they stay clean. Drug testing of
     correctional officers, and other selected employees is also an established policy in the
     Federal Bureau of Prisons.

     Drug Detection. Innovative drug detection technology is being piloted at Bureau
     institutions. The Office of National Drug Control Policy is working with the Bureau
     to provide the states with information on the best ways to keep drugs out of prisons.




                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

                                      PRESIDENT CLINTON:
                        FIGHTING DRUGS AND PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES


     A REcORD OF SUCCESS
      Overall Drug Use is Down. From 1979 to 1996, the number of people (12 and older) regularly using drugs in
        America has plummeted 49 percent, from 25.4 million to 13 million people. Similarly, the number of cocaine
        users has dropped 70 percent in the last decade (from 5.7 million in 1985 to 1.7 million in 1996).

        Youth Drug Use Is Beginning to Reverse. For the first time since 1992, illicit drug use among 12 to 17 year-
         olds has declined. Between 1995 and 1996, teen drug use fell from 10.9 percent to 9 percent.

        Crack Use is Declining. The most recent data from the Drug Use Forecasting Program show a decline in
         crack use by arrestees across the nation -- a good indication that the crack epidemic that began in 1987 has
         finally begun to abate.

        Good News on Methamphetamine. Meth use is down in the eight cities that had been suffering the highest
         increases in use: 52 percent drop in Dallas; 20 percent drop in San Jose; 19 percent in San Diego; 34 percent in
         Portland; and over 40 percent in Denver, Omaha and Phoenix.

        Cocaine Production Decreasing. In 1997, cocaine production in the Andean region, the primary cocaine
         producing area, decreased by as much as 100 tons from the previous year.        .

        Spending on Drug Consumption is Down. The most recent data shows the amount Americans spend buying
         illegal drugs is down roughly 37 percent from 1988 to 1995 -- a total decline of $34.1 billion.

        Drug-Related Crime in Decline. According to the FBI, in 1992, there were 1,302 murders related to
         narcotics. By 1996, that number hit a low of 819.

     HISTORIC AND HIGH PROFILE ANTI-DRUG STRATEGY
      The Largest Anti-Drug Budgets Ever. Year-in and year-out, President Clinton has proposed the largest anti-drug
        budgets ever. Between 1996 and 1998, resources for drug control increased by 19 percent, from $13.5
        billion in FY 1997 to $16 billion in FY98. The President's FY99 drug budget is $17.1 billion, including
        increases of $256 million for youth drug prevention, $364 million for domestic law enforcement, and
        $189 million for interdiction.

        Developed a Comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy. For the first time ever, the 1998 Strategy provides a
         ten-year plan to reduce drug use and its consequences in the United States by 50 -- to historic lows. This
         Strategy will reduce illegal drug use through law enforcement, prevention, treatment, interdiction and
         international efforts. This Strategy is backed by a five-year budget and performance benchmarks.

 BUILDING HEALTHIER FUTURES FOR OUR CHILDREN AND COMMUNITIES
  Targeting Young People with a $195 Million National Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The President is
   launching a massive national media campaign to motivate America's youth to reject illegal drugs and substance
   abuse. This unprecedented $195 million paid media campaign relies on high-impact, anti-drug television and
   radio advertisements aired during prime-time. In June, the campaign will go nationwide.

        Strengthening and Expanding the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. President Clinton expanded
         the Drug-Free Schools Act into the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act of 1994, making violence prevention a key
         part of this program. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program provides support for violence and drug


                                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion




          prevention programs to 97 of the nation's school districts. Schools use these funds to keep violence, drugs
          and alcohol away from students and out of schools.

     STOPPING DRUGS FROM CROSSING OUR BORDERS
      Put More Manpower and Resources into Fighting Drugs at the Border. The number of Border Patrol
        agents guarding our Southwest Border has doubled-- from 3,389 in FY93 to 6,213 at the end ofFY97. The
        number of Customs agents working on the Southwest Border has grown 16% from 2,000 in FY93 to 2,311 in
        FY97. The number of DE A, FBI, INS enforcement officers/agents and US marshals on the Southwest Border
       have also increased. Spending on Southwest Border counter-drug efforts has increased: Customs up 72
       percent (FY93-97); FBI up 21 percent (FY93-97); DEA up 30 percent (FY93-97); INS up 96 percent (FY93-
        97); and US Attorneys up 45 percent (FY93-97). The FY99 budget adds to this 1,000 new Border Patrol
        agents, and $54 million to Customs for advanced inspection technologies.

         Keeping Drugs Off the Street -- Border Seizures Are Up. The Clinton Administration has increased seizures of
          marijuana by 86 percent -- from 787,523 pounds in FY92 to 1,462,940 pounds in FY96. And seizures of
          heroin are up 32 percent -- from 1,157 kilograms in FY92 to 1,532 kilograms in FY96.



     WORKING INTERNATIONALLY TO PROTECT AMERICANS AT HOME
      Unprecedented Cooperation with Mexico to Fight Drugs. President Clinton and President Zedillo have
       signed two first-ever, historic counter-drug agreements: a binational drug Threat Assessment and a binational
       Counter-Drug Alliance, and are developing a historic bilateral counter-drug strategy.

         Standing Tough. Confronted with insufficient efforts to combat drugs and drug cartels, the Clinton
          Administration decertified Colombia ~- sending a strong message about our commitment to fighting
          drugs. Last year, the Clinton Administration successfully implemented "Zorro II," an effort to shut down a
          cocaine trafficking partnership between the Cali mafia and a major Mexican mafia trafficking organization.
