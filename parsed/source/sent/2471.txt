MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed .
                          Gene Sperling
                          Elena Kagan
                          Sally Katzen

SUBJECT:                  State of the Union/Budget Ideas

This memorandum provides a brief description of new ideas we are considering for the State of the
Union. Some work has been done on fleshing them out, but many need additional work and further
vetting through the interagency process. Most ofthese ideas involve increased spending, and you
will have to make choices among them and/or scale them back as you consider the FY 2000 budget.
Options relating to social security are not included in this memo.

EDUCATION AND TRAINING (DPC/NEC as specified)

1. Ending Social Promotion. Last year's budget proposal included $300 million for Education
Opportunity Zones in districts that agreed to remove bad teachers, tum around failing schools, and
end social promotions. The proposal required authorization, which Congress will never give us. For
next year, we recommend a simpler approach that uses existing authority and focuses entirely on
ending social promotion. We would like to expand our after-school program from $200 million to
$700 million and give a disproportionate share ofthis money to districts that end social promotion.
These school districts could use the money (as Chicago does) to provide extra help after school and
mandatory summer school for students who need it. (Cost: $200 million above FY99 budget.)
(DPC)

2. Teacher Quality and Recruitment. Now that we're on track to begin hiring 100,000 new
teachers to reduce class size, we have an even greater responsibility to help communities attract
talented new teachers to the profession. We envision a five-part strategy on teacher quality and
recruitment: (1) a $1 00 million increase in the teacher recruitment scholarships we enacted this year
in the Higher Education Act, which would put us on course to attract 60,000 new teachers at high-
need schools over the next five years; (2) a $60 million initiative -- modeled after the successful
Troops-to-Teachers program -- that would help states expand alternative certification routes and
attract talented people from other professions, such as military personnel and employees in finns
being downsized; (3) a nationwide crackdown on teacher education schools, including new
regulations authorized by the Higher Education Act to require report cards for education schools; (4)
a $50 million increase in the Eisenhower program to send secondary school teachers who teach
outside their field back to college to take additional courses in the subjects they're teaching, coupled



                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

with a new requirement that new secondary teachers pass competency tests in a subject before they
can teach it; and (5) a high-profile effort to help states make the most ofthe 15 percent set-aside for
teacher quality in the recently passed class size legislation. (Cost: about $210 million above FY99
budget) .. We are also exploring a politically interesting counter to private school choice: vouchers
for private school teachers -- i.e., an incentive program to encourage private school teachers to teach
in public schools. (DPC)

3. Work-Site Schools. One of the most promising new education ideas sprouting up around the
country is the creation of public schools located at work sites, designed primarily to serve
employees' children. School districts provide the teachers and curriculum; companies provide
facilities and upkeep. These schools-at-work serve a host ofbbjectives at once, by (1) providing new
facilities at no cost to the district, (2) increasing parental involvement in the schools and parental
satisfaction in the workplace; (3) reducing employee turnover and absenteeism; and (4) increasing
school diversity, because work sites are more diverse than residential neighborhoods. We propose a
$50 million increase in an existing magnet school program to provide grants to 50 communities to
launch work-site schools. We also are working with Treasury to develop a tax credit for businesses
that start on-site schools, similar to the Kohl business tax credit for on-site child care that is already
in our budget. (Cost: $50 million for start-up grants. No estimate yet for tax credit, but it will be
very small.) (DPCINEC) .

4. Expanding public school choice. As support grows for private school vouchers, we must
continue our efforts to expand choices within the public schools. Charter schools are one answer,
and we recommend a $20 million increase, to $120 million, to keep us on track to 3,000 charter
schools by 2002. Work-site schools are another. We also recommend increased funding for (1) an
existing grant program that helps urban and suburban school districts reduce racial isolation by
forming interdistrict magnet programs; and (2) magnet schools on university campuses, especially in
urban areas. (Cost: $25 million for 10 interdistrict magnet programs; $15 million for 10 university-
based schools.) (DPC)

5. School leadership academies. Research has shown that an effective principal is the single most
important indicator of school success, yet little has been done at the national or state level to improve
the management skills of principals. We propose a small initiative to create school leadership
academies that would provide training in management, teacher evaluation, school discipline, and
other areas to elementary school principals in high-poverty districts. (Cost: $50 million) (DPC)

6. Class size. To stay on course to reach 100,000 new teachers in seven years, we will ask for $1.3
billion in the FY2000 budget. We are planning an ambitious rollout ofthe class size initiative over
the next year, as we award first-year funding, issue guidance to local districts on how the program
works, and so on. We also will press Congress to restore the local matching requirement and
strengthen the provisions to require competency testing of new teachers. (DPC)

7. Partnership for a Literate America. According to the National Adult Literacy Survey, 44
million adults struggle with a job application, cannot read to their children, or are left on the welfare



                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

rolls because they lack basic skills. We are considering: (1) Workplace: a new tax credit and/or
Federal grants to encourage employers to provide adult basic education classes at the worksite, and
setting aside funds for work -based literacy proj ects within W elfare-to-Work competitive grants (se
welfare section of this memo); (2) Community: expanding the infrastructure and funding for adult
basic education through the Adult Education program, encouraging the development of programs
focused on easing the transition to the U.S. for new immigrants (through ESL and civics classes),
subsidizing the provision of child care on college campuses and other adult education sites, and
launching a national information campaign to make people aware of the problem of functional
illiteracy and of available services; and (3) Home: using the new Learning Anytime Anywhere
Partnerships to create software for adult basic education using $200 computers (e.g., W ebTV, game
players) and subsidizing public housing projects that create computer literacy programs. (NECIDPC)

8. National Campaign to Open Doors of College. Notwithstanding enormous strides we have
made in reducing the financial barriers to college, too many families assume college is more
expensive than it really is and are not aware of the aid that is available (Even among low-income
youth with high test scores, one-fourth say they have not been able to get much information about
financial aid for college). We are planning: (1) launching a major national public information
campaign about college costs and financial aid (e.g. naming a national chairman such as Bill Cosby,
having a national college visit day, etc.), (2) building on the authority in the new GEAR UP program,
providing every middle school (e.g. 7th grade counselor) with the ability to give students a "21 st
Century Scholar Certificate," indicating the financial aid that they are eligible for, and (3) seeking to
provide every high-poverty middle school with a college partner. This does not require any new
investment, just some focus and creativity. (NEC)

9. Improving the College Success Rate. Getting people in the doors of college is not enough to
close the racial and income opportunity gaps. For example, only 21 % of African-American and
18% of Hispanic students who begin college complete a bachelor's degree within 5 years compared
to 30% of White students. We are considering a package of policies to increase degree attaiiunent
among low-income and minority students, including: (1) a super-Pell grant for the lowest income
families and/or to encourage a full-time focus on school in the first year of college (this would be
expensive); (2) expanding successful mentoring and other support services in colleges (including
those aimed at graduate school preparation); (3) promoting college course-taking while in high
school; (4) improving articulation between two-year and four-year colleges; (5) encouraging
partnerships between predominately minority-serving and predominately majority-serving
institutions of higher education (particularly to promote graduate study); and (6) establishing a bridge
fellowship program for graduate study in science and technology fields for minorities and women.
(NEC)

10. School Modernization. The current assumption is that we will repeat this year's proposal for
tax credits to build and renovate sch?ols covering the interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds. We are
however, critically comparing our current proposal against other possible mechanisms to ensure we
have the most effective approach. (NEC)
11. .Further Expanding Junior ROTC. In response to the Los Angeles riots, Colin Powell



                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

proposed and Congress approved in 1992 an expansion of the high school-based JROTe. Since
then, 1,000 units have been added primarily in urban areas, bringing the total to nearly 2,600 units
with 400,000 participants. The budget increased over that period from $76 million to $166 million.
There is a waiting list of more than 450 schools that would like to have a JROTC unit. Because
DOD does not plan any further expansion, these 450 schools on the waiting list will not likely be
added: We could propose adding another 900 units over the next few years, to reach the authorized
maximum of3,500. Cost: about $235 million. (NEC)

12. Training American Workers for Current and Future Skills Gaps. We should
challenge the private sector to make specific commitments to train more American workers,
which they pledged to do during the debate on H1-B visas. They could provide more college
scholarships for women and minorities, partner with community colleges to develop
cutting-edge curricula, and encourage their employees to serve as telementors for middle
school students to get them excited about math and science. In addition, we are working on: (1) a
progra~ to foster partnerships ("Regional Skills Alliances") between industry and training providers
to train both employed and unemployed workers; (2) competitive grants to encourage companies to
develop programs in which they subsidize the training of individuals who they then commit to hire;
(3) extensions and/or expansions of some ofthe current training tax provisions (such as the lifelong
learning tax credit and Section 127); (4) a major informational/media campaign by the Departments
of Education and Labor to inform all Americans about available training opportunities, financial aid,
and job search assistance to allow them to develop the skills required for employment opportunities
around the country; (5) the adult literacy initiative described above; and (6) the "Improving the
College Success Rate" initiative described above. (NEC)

13. Making Job Training Universal. We are considering an initiative to make job training more
universal. The first component ofthis initiative would be to seek a significant increase in dislocated
worker funding -- about $190 million -- so that we are on path to provide training to every dislocated
worker who wants or needs it within five years. The second component would be to ensure that job
search assistance is available for every unemployed person. The final component would be to take
the steps necessary to ensure that every worker, regardless ofwhere they live, would be able to have
access to a One-Stop Career Center (where they can learn about job training, employment service
activities, unemployment insurance, vocational rehabilitation, adult education, and other assistance.)
 (NEC)

School safety -- see CRIME section

SERVICE (DPC)

1. AmeriCorps Seniors. In the wake of John Glenn's return to space, we have an opportunity to
give other senior citizens a mission. We propose adding $25 million to the current AmeriCorps
program to create a senior corps of 10,000 volunteers to serve as tutors and mentors and in
afterschool programs. We would build on a successful demonstration program that recruits seniors
to serve 15-20 hours per week over a fixed period oftime in schools and other community centers.



                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

In exchange, seniors would be eligible for small incentives, including awards to participate in senior
learning programs. By inspiring responsibility among seniors, this initiative would provide an ideal
complement to Social Security reform. John Glenn has expressed some interest in playing a role in
AmeriCorps now that he's retired. We could invite him back to the State ofthe Union and place him
in charge of a national effort to inspire seniors to serve. (Cost: $25 million)

2. Expand AmeriCorps. We propose expanding the AmeriCorps program from its current level of
50,000 members per year to approximately 70,000 per year, with the goal of reaching 100,000 per
year by the end of this Administration. These additional members could be targeted to serve
primarily in after-school and summer school programs. (Cost: $75 million)

3. Expand Service Component of Work-Study Program. Nearly 1 million students now receive
federal work-study funding. Despite our efforts, colleges and universities are required to use
only 7 percent of their work-study money for students employed in community service. The
higher education lobby would object, but we could propose a substantial increase in that
requirement -- e.g., phasing it up to 25 percent over the next 3 years.

HEALTH CARE (DPC/NEC as specified below)

1. Long-Term Care Initiative. This package could include: (1) a tax credit of up to $1,000 for
people with three or more limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) or their caregivers, at a
cost of about $6 billion over 5 years; (2) a plan for OPM to offer federal employees a choice of
high-quality private long-term care insurance policies at lower-than-market prices; (3) a
family caregiver support program, costing about $500 to $750 million over five years, that
would provide grants to states for "one-stop shops" to assist families who care for severely
impaired elderly relatives through counseling, training, and respite services; and (4) a nursing
home quality initiative, costing about $500 to $750 million over five years, that would include
new enforcement provisions ~, increased penalties), new funds for surveys of repeat
offenders and improved surveyor training, and perhaps a new commission to oversee HCFA's
nursing home enforcement efforts and to investigate other kinds offacilities where health care
is offered ~, assisted living facilities). (DPC/NEC)

2. Disability Proposals. This package could include: (1) the Jeffords-Kennedy Work
Incentives Improvement Act, which enables people with disabilities to go back to work by
giving them an option to buy into Medicaid and Medicare, at a cost of about $1.2 billion over 5
years; (2) a tax credit of $1,000 to $5,000 for working people with disabilities to assist them in
paying for the costs associated with employment, at a cost of about $1 to 2 billion over 5 years;
(3) a proposal, costing $50 million over five years, to promote the deinstitutionalization of
Medicaid beneficiaries by developing viable community-based care alternatives for people
residing in nursing homes after a "date certain"; and (4) a proposal to make Medigap
supplemental insurance more accessible to people with disabilities. Other non-health related
proposals focusing on disabilities include: a new competitive grant program, developed by
your disabilities task force, to increase the employment rate of adults with disabilities, and


                                                                      Automated Records ManagementSystem
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

efforts to ensure that new technologies are designed so as to be accessible to people with
disabilities (see below). (DPC/NEC)

3. Health Insurance Coverage Expansions. We could propose again, in somewhat new and
improved forms: (1) an initiative to encourage small businesses to form purchasing
cooperatives for health insurance, costing about $50 to 100 million over 5 years; (2) proposals
to improve outreach for children's health insurance; and (3) a proposal, more limited than last
year's, to provide a Medicare buy-in for certain people ages 55 to 65, benefiting about 30,000
people and costing $500 million over 5 years. (DPC/NEC)

4. Biomedical Research. We should again propose an increased investment in biomedical
research -- perhaps (depending on how we treat tobacco money in the budget) between $500
million and $1 billion. (DPC)

5. Antibiotics (Super Bug) Initiative. Resistance to antibiotics is becoming a public health
crisis, causing prolonged illnesses and even death. A new initiative, costing about $25 million
each year, could address this problem through: (1) a major outreach and education campaign
involving hospitals, health professionals, and managed care organizations; and (2) new
research and surveillance efforts to understand where and why antibiotic resistance occurs
and to develop effective responses. (DPC)

6. Bioterrorism Initiative. This initiative, costing $100-300 million each year, would: (1) train
epidemic intelligence officers who can coordinate with state health departments to identify and
respond to attacks; (2) develop a mass casualty emergency response system that includes
primary care, emergency transportation, and decontamination abilities; (3) create and
maintain a stockpile of pharmaceuticals; and (4) improve research to develop new vaccines
and antibiotics to be used in the event of attack. (DPC)

7. Protecting beneficiaries from HMO withdrawals from Medicare. This year, a number of
HMOs pulled out of Medicare with only a few months notice, leaving 50,000 beneficiaries with
no plan options in their areas. You announced that the Administration would develop
legislation to prevent this behavior in the future, and we are currently reviewing the best
approaches. (DPC/NEC)

8. Redesigning and increasing enrollment in Medicare's premium assistance program. Over 3
million low-income Medicare beneficiaries are eligible but do not receive Medicaid coverage of
their Medicare premiums and cost sharing. Many more may not get enough assistance
through a new provision that is supposed to help higher income beneficiaries. We are
developing a range of proposals, costing up to $500 million over five years, to use Social
Security Offices to educate beneficiaries about this program, reduce administrative complexity
for states, and give them incentives to engage in more aggressive outreach efforts. (DPC/NEC)

9. Prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. We are considering a variety of
proposals to address the lack of coverage for prescription drugs in Medicare, including a


                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dwnp Conversion

means-tested Medicaid option, an approach that would apply only in managed care, a
traditional benefit for all beneficiaries, and an unsubsidized purchasing mechanism that uses
Medicare's size as leverage for drug discounts for beneficiaries. If desirable, a proposal could
be included in the budget or coordinated with the March release of the Medicare
Commission's recommendations. The cost varies significantly depending on the proposal,
ranging from $1 to 20 billion a year. (DPC/NEC)

10. Disease Initiatives. We are working on several initiatives designed to combat particular
diseases. These initiatives, which you could choose to do individually or in combination, are:
(1) an asthma initiative, which will curb recent steep increases in asthma cases especially
among young children, by disseminating new treatment guidelines to state and local public
health programs and encouraging them to work with schools, child care organizations,
businesses, and other community organizations; (2) a mental illness initiative that will
accompany a Surgeon General's report on this subject (and perhaps a White House Conference
recommended by Mrs. Gore) and will include pUblic-private partnerships to improve access to
prevention and treatment, reforms in federal health programs to improve delivery of mental health
services, and funding increases in the mental health block grant; and (3) a heart disease initiative,
which could include: a new partnership with aging networks to evaluate and improve nutrition;
efforts to measure successful prevention approaches and replicate them nationwide; and the creation
of a network of educators, churches, and community-based organizations to launch a nationwide
awareness campaign. In each of these initiatives, the public health efforts described above would
supplement NllI funding of research projects. The estimated cost ofthese initiatives is $50 million
for asthma, $100 million for mental illness, and $20 million for heart disease. (DPC)

11. Food Safety. We are working on a food safety initiative that will highlight safety
standards and enforcement. Included in this initiative are: (1) a repackaged and somewhat
modified legislative proposal giving the FDA and USDA additional enforcement powers ~,
mandatory recalls and civil penalties); (2) additional food-specific regulations and/or
guidelines ~, for certain fruits and vegetables); and (3) more extensive adoption of our
model codes for restaurants and food service workers. In addition, we will focus on improving
coordination with state and local agencies that regulate food safety in order to develop a
wholly integrated national inspection system. (DPC)

TOBACCO (DPC)

1. State Menu. Our best vehicle for enacting tobacco legislation next year will be a legislative
waiver of federal Medicaid claims to the states' expected $200 billion settlement with the
tobacco companies. We will seek bipartisan agreement on a menu of uses for the federal share
of state money, with tobacco control and child care as our top priorities. We will try to use this
measure as a vehicle for other key elements of our tobacco policy, such as FDA jurisdiction
and warning labels.
2. Price Increase. One of the most difficult budget decisions will be whether to assume a
tobacco tax increase in our budget request, and if so, what to do with the money. Proponents



                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

argue that a substantial price increase is an essential part of our efforts to reduce youth
smoking,and we need the money to pay for new initiatives. Others argue that once again
using tobacco as a honeypot will hurt our ability to pass tobacco legislation and undermine the
credibility of our entire budget, since a big tax hike is unlikely to pass. If we do assume
tobacco revenue, the candidates for it include: (1) assistance to tobacco farmers (about $1
billion a year); (2) the long-term care tax credit (about $1 billion a year); (3) other tax cuts,
such as a child care / stay-at-home tax credit and/or a reduction in the marriage penalty; (4)
NIH research; (5) public health programs; and (6) the Medicare trust fund and/or a new
prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.

FAMILIES AND CHILDREN (DPCINEC as specified)

1. Expansion of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (old policy). We propose to
expand the Child Care and Development Block Grant as we did in the FY 1999 Budget. The block
grant is the primary federal child care subsidy program, helping low-income working families to pay
for child care. Currently, between one and two million children are served by the program, leaving
roughly nine million children who are eligible but unserved. This proposal would cost at least $7.5
billion over five years. (DPC)

2. Tax Relief for Parents, Including Parents who Stay at Home. We are considering replacing
our last year's proposal to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit with a new proposal to
benefit all parents, including those who stay home. This change will address the criticism that our
child care initiative did little for stay-at-home parents. We are reviewing proposals to (1) double the
child tax credit to $1,000 per child for all children under the age of four, at a cost of about $12 billion
over five years; (2) increase the stan~ard deduction for each child under the age ofthree by $1 ,000, at
a cost of about $3 billion over five years; or (3) expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit as
we did last year and extend its benefits to parents with children below age three by assuming
minimum child care expenses of$150 each month, at a total cost of about $21 billion over five years.
 Each of these proposals can be dialed up or down by adjusting either the age threshold or the dollar
amount. (DPCINEC)

3. Tax Credit for Businesses Providing Child Care. We could again propose to provide a tax
credit to businesses that provide child care services for their employees. The credit, which covers
25% of qualified costs but may not exceed $150,000 per year, costs $500 million over 5 years. To
further build on this concept, we also propose to provide tax credits to businesses that provide on-site
schools (see education section). (DPCINEC)

4. Parent Paid Leave Plan. Many workers cannot afford to take unpaid leave following the birth or
adoption of a child, even though they have access to an unpaid leave policy through FMLA or
voluntary employer benefit plans. To address this problem, we are considering a proposal to provide
eligible parents who already have access to unpaid leave with partial wage replacement for a set
period oftime. The cost of the program, which would be administered through the Unemployment
Insurance System, varies according to the selected eligibility criteria. Ifwe choose, for example, to
give $200 per week for four weeks to new parents with median income (about $37,000) or below, the


                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

cost will be about $875 million for FY 2000 (including start-up and administrative expenses). (DPC)

5. FMLA Expansion to Businesses with 25 Workers (old but unarticulated policy). Under
current law, workers are eligible for FMLA coverage only if they work at a bt,lsiness with 50 or more
employees and ifthey have worked at least twelve months and 1,250 hours for the employer. In your
last State of the Union, you called for covering more workers under the FMLA, but did not fully
articulate how you would do so. We could now advance a specific proposal to lower the FMLA
threshold to 25 or more workers, which would expand coverage for up to ten million more American
workers. (DPCINEC)

6. Parent Education and Support Fund. We are considering proposals to create a competitive
grant program administered by HHS to fund parent education and support programs, including home
visitation programs and "second chance maternity homes" to support teen mothers and teach
parenting skills. This fund could cost about $500 million over five years. (DPC)

7. Adoption Registry. We are working on plans to create an Internet-based adoption registry of
fosfer care children waiting to be adopted, so that prospective adoptive parents can learn about these
waiting children. Funding this registry would require very smally increase in HHS's Adoption
Opportunities Grant Program. (DPC)

COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT (DPC/NEC for all)

1. CDFI Tax Credit. We are looking at a proposal to extend tax incentives to encourage
investment in CDFIs, which would leverage additional private investment in distressed areas and
stimulate the economic revitalization of those areas. Under the proposal, $100 million in non-
refundable tax credits would be made available to the CDFI Fund to allocate among equity investors
in qualified CDFls using a competitive process.

2. Microcredit Initiative. Weare working to identify means to increase support for micro enterprise
finance, both domestically and internationally. We are examining whether to build on Senators
Kennedy's and Domenici's PRIME legislation which would provide technical assistance to
microenterprise. We are also looking at increased funding for CDFI initiatives specifically targeted
to microenterprise, and CRA and other regulatory reform designed to enhance bank lending to
microenterprise funds. On the international side, we are looking at whether we can increase
microenterprise funding through USAID or MDBs, especially to countries hardest hit by the financial
cnS1S.


3. Clean Water, Parks, and Communities Bonds. We are examining three proposals to
encourage "green" infrastructure projects. The first model uses the same financing mechanism as
your school construction proposal for a menu of projects: protecting and improving water quality;
cleanup of contaminated sediments; waterfront reclamation and revitalization; stormwater runoff
control; purchasing of green spaces to prevent sprawl; park enhancements and revitalization, and
brownfields cleanup. The second model, which provides a smaller incentive than the first model,
would create new tax-exempt bond authority for these state and local areas to invest in clean water,


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

parks, and communities. The advantage ofthis model is that it builds on the current system of bond
finance. The final model would allocate tax credits (like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit) to
states and local areas to provide to the developers of these green infrastructure projects.

4. Employment Tax Credits. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit and the Welfare-To-Work Tax
Credit encourage employers to hire and retain members of certain economically disadvantaged
targeted groups. Both credits will expire on June 30, 1999. Under this proposal the two credits
would be made permanent.

5. Re-Develop 10,000 Abandoned Buildings. Abandoned buildings are a symbol of urban blight,
and an action plan to turn this around will be a powerful signal of change. We are examining
different proposals to help re-develop 10,000 abandoned buildings, combining several existing
programs or providing grants or tax incentives to spur private-sector redevelopment ofthese
sites.

6. Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and Regional Affordable Housing Initiative. Last year,
you proposed a 40-percent expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to spur the private
sector to develop more affordable rental housing for low-income Americans. We recommend that
you again ask Congress to take this action, which would restore the value of the credit to its 1986
level and help develop an additional 150,000-180,000 affordable housing units over the next five
years. This proposal would cost $1.6 billion over five years. At the same time, you could propose a
Regional Affordable Housing Initiative to increase the availability of affordable housing in areas
with high growth in low-skilled jobs and inadequate supplies of housing for low-income workers.
This proposal could be funded through HUD's HOME program and would cost $125 million over
five years.

7. Homeownership Tax Credit. We are examining two kinds of tax credits to promote
homeownership among lower-income families, who generally do not benefit from the mortgage
interest deduction. The first proposal would use the model ofthe Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to
create a Low-Income Homeownership Tax Credit. Under this proposal, low-income families would
receive a low" or zero-interest second mortgage, which would reduce their upfront costs (~,
downpayment and closing costs) and investors would receive tax credits in return. The second
proposal is a $5,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers in Empowerment Zones or Enterprise
Communities.

8. Housing for the Elderly Initiative. This proposal is designed to improve housing for elderly
people and thereby provide an alternative to nursing home care. In addition to providing capital to
improve and mOdify such housing to meet the needs of elderly residents, the initiative would provide
housing vouchers for low income elderly who live in housing developed through the Low-Income
Housing Tax Credit. Because the tax credit helps subsidize rent, this proposal would allow us to
leverage our resources and provide more vouchers to the poor elderly.

9. Incremental Tenant-based Section 8 Vouchers. To build on our success in this past year's


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

budget, we recommend seeking an additional 50,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers and another
25,000 vouchers to meet the needs of the homeless, including elderly homeless and homeless
veterans.

10. Homelessness. We are working on a three-part proposal that would: (1) assist the
approximately 250,000 homeless veterans by increasing residential alternatives, community-based
contracted care, job preparation activities, stand down activities (community-sponsored events that
conduct one-stop service deli very programs for homeless veterans), the distribution of clothing, and
long-term housing; (2) allow V A to sell surplus property with 10 percent of proceeds going to
homeless veterans; and (3) start a demonstration project targeted to the chronically homeless to test
the most promising models for moving the chronically homeless to self-sufficiency using a
combination of permanent housing and links to mainstream services. Cost: $105 million -- $60
million for VA and $45 million for HUD demonstration project.

RURAL/AGRICULTURE (NECIDPC as specified)

1. Strengthening the Safety Net. To help farmers suffering from the depressed export markets
and natural disasters, we are considering various reforms ofthe crop insurance program and
closing gaps in the emergency loan program. We are paying special attention to programs that
will help small family farms. (NEC)

2. Bringing the knowledge ofland grant colleges to every rural American: The USDA spends
$1.6 billion on agricultural research, much of it at America's land grant colleges and
universities. The government could provide grants to ensure that this information is available
on the Internet and is well-organized --so that all rural Americans can easily access
information on topics such as crops, livestock, rural development, natural resource
conservation, and food safety. (NEC)

3. Emergency Medical Services in Rural Areas. The presence of viable emergency systems is
critical for residents in rural areas, because ofthe high rates of injury associated with jobs in
these areas and the long distances to health providers. This proposal, costing about $50
million, would provide funds to States and local communities to improve access to 911 services
or alternative emergency systems. It also would fund programs to help rural communities
train local citizens in CPR and first responder techniques and to recruit and retain emergency
personnel. (DPC)

TECHNOLOGY (NEC)

1. Curbcuts on the Information Highway. We are looking at several options that would make
information technology usable by people with disabilities in a manner that improves their
lives: (1) investing in R&D (e.g., text-to-speech, automatic captioning, speech recognition); (2)
giving disabilities groups a seat at the table as the standards for new technologies are
developed; and (3) making the government a model "user" of accessible technology. In



                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

addition, the tax credit for work-related impairment expenses for people with disabilities could
be used to expand the market for assistive technology.
2. A Digital Library for Science, Math and Engineering. We need to get every young student
and undergraduate excited about math, science and engineering. One approach we are exploring is
creating a "digital library," which would contain lectures from Nobel Prize laureates, have an ability
to track and replicate cutting-edge scientific experiments, and make it easier for students and
teachers to locate the best instructional material on the Internet.

3. A User-Friendly Information Age Government. American citizens should not have to learn
the "org chart" of the federal government. Building on the efforts of the Vice President's
"reinventing government" activities, the Administration will be developing a series of "one stop
shops" that tie together the most useful information and on-line transactions for students, senior
citizens, exporters, and small businesses.

4. Information Technology Research Initiative. Increasing our investment in information
technology research, which is currently about $1 billion ofthe federal research budget, could lead to
the following breakthroughs: supercomputers that can more rapidly perform important functions,
such as designing life-saving drugs and predicting severe weather systems; wireless networks that
can bring telemedicine and distance learning to rural America; a device of the size of a paper that
could monitor the vital signs of a senior citizen, send a "911" message in the event of a medical
emergency, and provide an exact location using global positioning technology; new software tools
that can help us cope with "information overload" by discovering patterns in huge quantities of data;
and intelligent spacecraft that can explore the Solar System. Options have been developed at roughly
$100, $200 and $400 million in FY2000; and $1, $2 and $3 billion over 5 years.

5. 21st Century Research Fund. One initiative that you announced in last year's budget that we
think is important to continue is the 21 st Century Research Fund -- which provided across-the-board
support for civilian R&D at agencies such as NIH, NSF, and Energy. This year, Congress provided a
10 percent increase for basic research, so this is an area where bipartisan cooperation is possible.

CRIME (DPC)

1. Crime Bill II. The 1994 Crime Act will expire at the end of the FY 2000 budget cycle,
guaranteeing that the next Congress will consider major crime legislation. We recommend that you
get a jump on this debate by using your State of the Union and FY 2000 budget to challenge
Congress to pass a new crime bill that builds on the core elements of the successful 1994 Act -- more
police, smarter punishment, and more prevention. Most of the money required is already built into
future budgets; continuation of the COPS program, however, will require new funds totaling about
$1 billion. We believe that a new Crime Act should include the following elements:

      Community-Oriented Policing and Prosecution Services (COPPS). Your pledge to help
       fund 100,000 more police is likely to be fulfilled before the end of next summer. A new
       COPPS initiative (note the extra "P" for "Prosecution"), costing about $1.4 billion in the first




                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

        year, could include funds to: (I) hire, redeploy, and retain an estimated 7,500 more police
        each year; (2) provide modem technology and equipment and support training in modem
        policing techniques, with a special emphasis on "hot spots" technology; (3) hire, train, and
        equip prosecutors to join local police in fighting crime on a more community-based, pro-
        active basis; and (4) support partnerships between law enforcement and community-based
        groups to prevent crime in their areas.

       A new focus on probation supervision and coerced abstinence. The puriishment title of
        the crime bill now focuses largely on prison construction; we recommend shifting the focus
        to a new "Certainty of Punishment" initiative that will sUPR0rt the expanded use of probation
        supervision and of drug testing and treatment.

      Gun initiatives. A new crime bill should include your longstanding firearms priorities --
       juvenile Brady, Brady II, federal CAP legislation and child safety locks. It also could include
       new proposals to: (1) close the loophole that exempts many firearms sales at gun shows and
       flea markets from Brady background checks; (2) expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction
       Initiative (YCGII) -- to trace all crime guns and investigate gun traffickers -- to an additional
       20-40 cities; and (3) assemble gun strike forces -- teams of federal prosecutors and ATF
       agents, acting with local law enforcement -- to target cities with high levels of gun violence
       and crack down on gun traffickers.

      Values-based crime prevention initiative. In addition to other crime bill prevention
       programs, we could invest in promoting values-based crime and violence prevention efforts,
       such as those of Rev. Eugene Rivers. Funds from this program would go to comprehensive
       prevention programs run by faith-based and other institutions seking to instill and reinforce
       common sense values in troubled youth.

2. Safe, Disciplined, and Drug-Free Schools. At the White House Conference on School
Safety, you announced that you would overhaul and strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free
Schools Program. Under this proposed reform, funds will be appropriately targeted to schools
with serious drug and crime problems, and schools will have to adopt rigorous, comprehensive
school safety plans that include: tough but fair discipline policies, such as zero tolerance for
guns and drugs; safe passage to and from schools; effective drug and violence policies and
programs; annual school safety and drug use report cards; links to after school programs;
efforts to involve parents; and crisis management plans. We also could include in this package
(1) funds for states that adopt a policy of drug testing first-time applicants for drivers' licenses and
(2) funds for school districts that adopt a policy of drug testing middle and high school students with
parental consent. We believe that these reforms will require up to $450 million in new funding in
FY 2000.

3. Parity for SUbstance Abuse Treatment. Appropriate substance abuse treatment remains
unavailable to nearly half of the people who need it. To help fill this treatment gap, we could
propose legislation to encourage parity between substance abuse treatment and other medical


                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                           }kx-Dump Conversion

benefits. Similar to the Mental Health Parity Act signed into law in 1996, a current draft of
this legislation would prohibit health care plans that provide a substance abuse benefit from
setting annual or lifetime dollar limits on this benefit at a lower level than those for other
medical and surgical benefits. At the same time, we would have to ensure that federal health
programs provide parity between substance abuse treatment and other medical benefits; we
are still exploring the cost of any necessary reforms to these programs.

4. Binge Drinking. We are working on a number of proposals regarding alcohol abuse,
including (1) promoting a voluntary code for alcohol advertisements directed toward minors;
(2) banning alcohol billboards near schools; (3) discouraging alcohol advertising on youth-
oriented web sites; (4). and funding educational efforts about the dangers of alcohol
consumption.

WELFARE REFORM, CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT, AND CHILD WELFARE (DPC)

1. Reauthorize the Welfare-to-Work Program. Congress authorized the Welfare-to-Work
Program for only two years; if we wish to continue our current investment in the hardest-to-employ,
we will have to propose a reauthorization of about $1.5 billion annually. Within this funding level,
we propose several set-asides, totaling $500 million, for the following specific purposes: (1) work-
based English-language literacy projects for immigrants and others; (2) work-based substance abuse
testing and treatment programs; (3) employment services for welfare recipients with disabilities; and
(4) a work-based program to promote responsible fatherhood, including efforts to increase low-
income fathers' employment and earnings and ensure that they provide financial and other support to
their children.

2. Child Support. One initiative, costing just a few million dollars each year, would increase
the prosecution of egregious child support violators by establishing multi-agency teams,
working with state and local law enforcement, to identify, analyze, and investigate cases for
prosecution. A pilot project of this kind is already under way in five states; this proposal
would put these units in place all across the nation within the next several years. A second
initiative would seek legislation to exclude doctors and other health care providers who are
delinquent in child support from the Medicare program or from programs offering health
professional loans.

3. Children "Aging Out" of Foster Care. Each year, nearly 20,000 18-year-olds "age out" of the
public child welfare system. Federal financial support for these young people ends just at the time
they are making the critical transition to adulthood. Areas for increased investment for these young
adults include: (1) expanding the independent living program, which provides services to foster care
children in this age group; (2) expanding the transitional living program, a competitive grant
program that funds community-based organizations that provide services to this population,
including housing support; and (3) giving states the option of using Federal Medicaid dollars to
provide health care coverage for this population. (Cost: roughly $150 million each year)

 CIVIL RIGHTS (DPC)

 1. Equal Pay. We are working on a program to be run by the EEOC and DOL to increase
 outreach to businesses and employees about equal pay requirements, provide technical
 assistance to businesses seeking to comply, improve training for EEOC employees, and expand
 enforcement capabilities. In addition, the program will fund research on the nature and extent
 of wage discrimination, as well as a new Women in Non-Traditional Occupations Initiative
 designed to improve access of women into occupations such as construction and high
 technology. Cost: about $20 million for EEOC and $10 million for DOL)

 TRANSPORTATION (NECIDPC as specified)

 1. Reauthorization ofthe FAA, with Focus on Modernization and Competition. A blue-ribbon
 panel concluded last year that the air transportation system faces "gridlock" within a decade
 without sweeping changes. We are considering various policy options to incorporate into the
 FAA reauthorization that you will likely propose in 1999 that will: (1) improve the efficiency
 and capacity ofthe nation's aviation system, and (2) enhance competition and service to rural
 areas. Some of the components of this initiative would include: centralizing the air traffic
 control services (ATS) in a performance-based organization; financing ATS for commercial
 aviation through cost-based user fees; increasing Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs) to finance
 airport expansion nationwide; modifying federal rules on how airports can use PFCs and other
 funds to encourage new airline entrants; and enhancing service to underserved areas.

We are also looking at ways to further competition in international aviation. The
Administration has extended the benefits of competition by negotiating dozens of bilateral
open-skies agreements. We could press our trading partners for World Wide Open Skies and
explore lifting other restrictions on foreign aviation investment and operation on a reciprocal
basis. (NEC)

  2. Auto Safety. We are making headway on auto safety. Last year, the number and rate of
  auto fatalities declined. However, we still have a long way to go -- more than 40,000 Americans
  die in auto accidents each year, at a direct cost of $150 billion. The keys are seatbelts (more)
  and alcohol (less). We are working on a comprehensive initiative that would include: (1)
  meeting the President's goal of 85 percent seatbelt compliance by the year 2000, which would
  save 4,000 lives and nearly $7 billion; (2) promoting education initiatives like the Buckle-Up
  America campaign; (3) enforcing the TEA-21 requirement that states lower the legal blood
  alcohol content level from .10 to .08; and (4) pushing a new Administration initiative on
  children's safety that will target auto accidents, among other problems, by promoting the use
. of child safety seats, booster seats (for children ages 4-8), and bicycle helmets. (NECIDPC)

3. Transportation Needs of the Aged. With the number of Americans over 65 expected to

                                                                                  M ement System
                                                                 Automated Records anag
                                                                 Hex.Dump Conversion

grow by half by 2020, we should begin addressing the need to ensure their continued mobility,
independence and safety in their later years. We are only beginning to look at this issue with
DOT, which plans to hold six town meetings soon with senior citizens, medical experts,
transportation safety specialists, and others to discuss the problems and challenges and
identify best practices. The U.S. will host an international conference on this topic next year,
in connection with the United Nation's Year of Older Persons. This may be combined with the
long-term care and the housing for the elderly initiatives. (NEC)

4. Sustainable Development and "Smart Growth." Sensible, flexible transportation initiatives
can improve both our economy and our quality of life. First, we will continue investing in
sustainable transportation. TEA-21 authorizes a record $41 billion over the next six years for
transit; increases tax-free transit benefits; and expands communities' ability to transfer funds
from highway construction to transit, bicycle and pedestrian programs, telecommuting and
other forms of transportation that reduce congestion and pollution. Second, we need to
empower communities to make smart choices, choosing the right transportation investments
for their needs. As result of a new policy DOT announced in April, communities can now use
federal funds to clean and reuse "brownfiel~s," preserving farms and forests for the future.
Third, we need to make communities more livable, with support for low-cost projects with big
quality-of-Iife benefits, such as bicycle paths and historic preservation. (NEC)

ENERGY (NEC)

1. Proposing the Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act. You could call on Congress to
enact the electricity restructuring legislation Act, to make the electricity industry more
competitive and to provide more choices for industrial, commercial and residential customers.
The Administration's Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act will save consumers $20
billion a year. Retail competition will not only improve efficiency, but also reduce the two-
thirds waste of energy currently associated with fossil-fuel generation of electricity, thereby
cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

2. Distributed Generation ("Micropower"). To increase the consumer savings and
environmental benefits from electricity competition, the Administration will pursue legislation
to eliminate obstacles to the use ofsmall, clean efficient generation technologies (e.g., fuel cells
and photovoltaics) that can be installed at or near the electricity user's site. Moving from
large, central-station generation of electricity to distributed generation by small, clean sources
is analogous to the move from mainframe computers to personal computers.

PENSIONS (NEC)

1. Expanded Private Pension Plan Coverage: Last year, you announced several initiatives to
expand pension plan coverage which were not enacted, but which we continue to believe are
important and have substantial support (m the Hill. We should again call for legislation that:
authorizes a simplified plan for small businesses that combines the best features of a defined benefit



                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex.Dump Conversion

and defined contribution plan (SMART), costing $313 million over five years; provides a three-year
tax credit to encourage small businesses to set up retirement programs, costing $508 million over
five years; and authorizes payroll deductions for IRAs. We are exploring ways to expand coverage
for moderate and lower-income workers. Consideration is also being given to ways of enabling
multiple small businesses to pool together for pension plan administration.
2. Women's Retirement Security: To underscore the importance of pensions for women's
retirement security, you would call for legislation enacting the two initiatives you announced in late
October -- namely, that time taken under FMLA should count toward retirement plan vesting
requirements and mandating that employer plans offer an option that pays less while the retired
employee is living but pays a survivor benefit equal to at least 75 percent of the benefit the couple
received while both were alive.

3. Pension Portability: You could renew your call for reducing vesting requirements from five years
to three years for employer matching contributions to 401 (k) and other plans to reflect an increasingly
mobile workforce, and more workers moving in and out ofthe workforce over a lifetime. We are also
exploring various options that would increase pension portability and facilitate the movement of
retirement savings between plans, where this can be done without encouraging "leakage" or loss of
worker protections -- e.g., providing that federal employees can roll over retirement savings from
private sector qualified plans into the federal Thrift Savings Plan.

4. Expand Pension Right to Know Provisions: You could call for a pension right to know package
that provides for both workers and their spouses general information relating to retirement needs and
their benefits under employer retirement plans. In addition, an employee's spouse should have the
same rights to get information as the employee, before waiving the statutorily provided survivor
protection. You should call for a Pension Right to Know package that provides information for both
workers and their spouses. We are also working on an employee education program that would
provide employees with the tools they need to work with their employers to provide pension plans,
and are thinking about how.to encourage courses in high schools on the importance of savings and
other general investment education (which can be combined with the Consumer Literacy and
Education campaign described below). Consideration is also being given to a savings stamp book
program in the schools (sell savings stamps in very small amounts; when the book is full, tum it in
for a U.S. savings bond) to help educate the young about how to reach savings goals.

5. Increase Retirement Security: To promote security, we are continuing to work on the pension
audit bill, changes to the multi employer (collectively bargained) plan rules, and expansion of
PBGC's missing participant program.

FINANCIAL SERVICES (NECIDPC for all)

1. Consumer Financial Literacy and Education. We are currently developing a set of
proposals to promote consumer financial awareness and enhance consumer credit literacy,
ranging from a public awareness campaign to establishing an educational clearinghouse to
disseminate quality curricula to high school students. We are also working on a study to



                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

identify what the biggest problems are with how Americans use consumer credit, and what
basic banking services and steps they can take to help themselves (this may be very important
if bankruptcy reform is a live item next year). Part of our focus is on reaching out to low-
income households, building on (and expanding) two existing government programs --
Treasury's Electronic Funds Transfer program that was a first step in helping the "unbanked"
enter into electronic commerce and a USDA extension program that is providing some
(limited) services to rural low-income families. This proposal would cost $5-10 million.

2. Consumer Financial Bill of Rights. In order to respond to the outrage consumers feel about
ATM surcharges, without supporting economically questionable regulation of ATM fees, we
are considering a proposal either for the government or for financial institutions voluntarily to
make publicly available a list of basic banking services and fees on an individual or geographic
basis to be published periodically over the Internet. The services profiled would include, but
would not be limited to, charges for access to ATMs. We are also considering the adequacy of
current credit card disclosure requirements (again, relevant to bankruptcy reform) and other
areas where information about financial service arrangements would be helpful to consumers.
This would cost $3-5 million.
