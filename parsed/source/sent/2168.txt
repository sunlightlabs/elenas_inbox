Looks fine, except "right decision" should be "right direction" in the
second paragraph and "industries bottom line" should be "industry's bottom
line" in the third paragraph.

Would you take a look at this and tell what you think of it? It    is a
generic one pager highlighting our tobacco agenda for the year.    We'd like
to include it in a package of materials going to help senior
administration officials prepare for commencement addresses. Do    you see
any problems with it? If at all possible, please e-mail me your    edits by
1:30 pm today. thanks. k

 The following is a HEX DUMP:

                      "The facts are as plain as the stakes are high: Three thousand children begin to
          smoke every day, even though it's illegal in every state, and /,000 will die earlier because
          of it. All these children have been targeted by a massive, multimillion-dollar media
          campaign that preys on their insecurities and their dreams ... We are fighting for the lives
          of our children. We are fighting for the public health, and we are fighting against
          predatory practices by tobacco companies that have targeted our children. "

                                                                         President Bill Clinton
                                                                         April 20, 1998

CLEAR FACTS, HIGH STAKES. 3,000 children begin to smoke every day; 1,000 of them will die
early as a result. The President is committed to passing comprehensive legislation to stop young
Americans from smoking before they start, in an effort that can save one million lives over the
next five years.

A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE TOBACCO REFORM. President Clinton believes that
Senator McCain and Senator Hollings' tobacco legislation bill, which passed the Commerce
Committee, is a strong step in the right decision on the road to passing comprehensive tobacco
legislation this year.

STANDING STRONG FOR COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. The tobacco industry is working to
persuade Congress to pass weaker legislation that will not reduce teen smoking. We must
continue to work with Senator McCain and others to make reducing teen s~oking the
tobacco industries bottom line.

A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR REDUCING YOUTH TOBACCO USE. President Clinton's plan for
comprehensive tobacco legislation includes five key principles:

      A comprehensive plan to reduce youth smoking by raising the price of packs of
       cigarettes by up to $1.50 over ten years through a combination of annual
       payments and tough penalties on the tobacco industry;

      Full authority for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco
       products;

      Changes in the way the tobacco industry does business, including ending
       marketing and promotion to kids;

    . Progress toward other public health goals, including biomedical and cancer
       research, a reduction of second-hand smoke, promotion of smoking cessation
       programs, and other urgent priorities; and

      Protection for tobacco farmers and their communities.
