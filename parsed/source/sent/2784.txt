                                March 18, 1999 -- First Draft

A revolution in technology and increased competition in financial services give Americans more
numerous and complex financial choices than ever before. Consumers should have the tools to profit
from these new opportunities and protection from new abuses. Certainly, many consumers already
benefit from this financial revolution -- they have greater access to credit, can comparison shop for
mortgage rates on the Internet, and use credit cards to earn frequent flyer miles. But new products have
brought new risks and new opportunities for predatory practices. We must update our consumer
protection laws and practices to adapt to a changing marketplace.

THE CLINTON-GORE PLAN

Today, President Clinton unveiled a package of legislative proposals and executive actions to protect
consumers and their privacy in the new economy. It is based on five principles: (I) Protect financial
privacy; (2) Expand the consumer's right-to-know; (3) Prevent fraud and abusive practices; (4) Expand
access to financial services; and (5) Educate consumers and improve financial literacy. The following
proposals were among those announced.

PROTECT FINANCIAL PRIVACY

Vice President Gore has led the Administration's efforts to identify needed privacy protections. He
understands that consumers value the privacy of financial and credit records, second only to medical
privacy. Yet a technological revolution is now making it possible and profitable to use financial data in
ways never possible before. Existing law allows a bank, broker, or insurance company to share
infonnation with a third party or their own affiliate about your transactions (account balances, who you
write checks to, how much, insurance payments, stock purchases, etc.). Most consumers would be
shocked to learn that the law treats this infonnation as belonging to the bank -- not to the consumer.
Moreover, with the increasing number of insurance companies and banks merging, the banks now have
access to some consumer medical records. A consumer who undergoes a physical exam to obtain
insurance should not have to fear that the infonnation could be used to lower their credit card limit or
deny them a mortgage. The Clinton-Gore Administration says that:

      Consumers must be told what information an institution would share or sell, when, to
       whom, and for what purposes;
      Consumers must be given the right to "opt out" -- the right to say "NO" to the sharing of
       their information; and
      Consumers' medical information simply should not be sold or shared among affiliates in a
       financial conglomerate.

EXPAND THE CONSUMER'S RIGHT-TO-KNOW

In 1998, consumers received nearly 4 billion credit card solicitations. With credit card companies
competing to get attention, new tenns and conditions are being offered. While lower rates and new
features are providing consumer benefits, there are numerous new traps for the unwary. Consumers
complain most frequently about misleading low "teaser rates" and unexpected interest rate hikes. In
addition, card companies have lowered minimum payment requirements, leaving some consumers

                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
Administration would:

      Require that any marketing of "teaser" rates for credit cards include equally prominent
       disclosure of the expiration date of the rate and the eventual annual percentage rate.
      Require clear and conspicuous notice of how long and how costly repayment would be if
       the consumer makes only the minimum payment.

Consumers also are frustrated with ATM surcharges -- fees charged by the ATM provider in addition
to what the bank charges per transaction. Consumers can vote with their feet, but once a transaction is
begun few want to stop and go elsewhere. While many ATM networks require disclosure of the
surcharge on both the face of the machine and the terminal screen, not all ATMs have the dual
disclosure and the requirements are not legally enforceable. The Clinton-Gore Administration would:

      Require clear and conspicuous disclosure of ATM surcharges on both the machine and
       the terminal screen.

PREVENT FRAUD AND ABUSIVE PRACTICES

Once, stealing another's identity required fraudulent documents, but today the use of another's personal
identification information (e.g.,social security numbers and credit cards) canbe sufficient to commit
fraud. Last October, Congress passed and th.e President signed the Identity Theft and Assumption
Deterrence Act. The Clinton-Gore Administration will:

      Launch a vigorous enforcement, education, and prevention strategy to combat identity
       theft, led by the Treasury Department, with Justice other agencies.

EXPAND ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES

Too many Americans cannot afford, or do not have access to, basic banking services. To expand
access, the Clinton-Gore Administration will:

      Provide basic electronic banking accounts for federal benefit recipients, providing them
       with a low-cost, yet safe and sound place to deposit and save money. Treasury would pay
       to establish low-fee accounts for federal benefit recipients.

EDUCATE CONSUMERS AND IMPROVE FINANCIAL LITERACY

The daunting complexity of financial products and choices increases the importance of consumer
financial education. President Clinton today directed the National Economic Council to convene a
high level interagency group to prepare a plan to raise financial literacy and expand the
Administration's commitment to consumer financial education.




                                                  2

                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

This section provides a short summary of the entire package of proposals. (All items
require legislation unless otherwise noted.)

1. Protecting financial privacy

            Expand notice and opt-out requirements to cover all credit .
             information: We would expand protection of consumers' credit records
             under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), by requiring customer notice
             and opt-out choice before an organization can share transaction or
             experience information with a third party or an affiliate. (Currently, notice
             and opt-out is only required before sharing non-transaction information
             (e.g., credit report or application information).)

             Prevent use of medical information for credit decisions or other
             purposes: With the growing number of mergers between insurance and
             financial services firms, lenders and brokers potentially have access to
             private medical information. We would prohibit the sharing of medical
             information, such as that gathered from health or life insurance records,
             within financial services conglomerates (e.g., between banking and
             insurance affiliates).

             Monitor Bank Compliance with FCRA. Currently, bank regulators may
             not examine for compliance, but must wait for a consumer complaint. We
             would provide regulators with broader authority to monitor compliance.
             (We supported the same last year.)

2. Expanding disclosure

      a.     Credit Cards

      Prevent Misleading Credit Card Marketing of "Teaser" Rates. One of the
      most frequent consumer complaints is that they had not understood marketing
      materials on credit card interest rates and were shocked when rates
      skyrocketed. We would require that any marketing of "teaser" rates for credit
      cards include equally prominent disclosure of the expiration date of the rate and
      the eventual APR rate. Such disclosuresSimilar considerations are already
      roquiredreflected in disclosures for closed-end credit. [closed end credit
      requires APR disclosure of blended rate, not both]

      Require Credit Card Minimum Payment Disclosures. In recent years, credit
      cards have lowered minimum payments, leaving some consumers unaware how
      little progress they are mClking on repaying their debt. As proposed in last year's

                                            1


                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
long and how costly repayment would be if the consumer makes only the
minimum payment.

Require "Surgeon General's Warning" With Credit Cards. Few lenders now
make an individual assessment of whether a debtor has the capacity to repay
(current income versus current expenses) before extending new lines of credit,
relying instead upon statistical models that predict likelihood of repayment from
credit scores and other characteristics. As proposed in last year's bankruptcy
legislation, we would require that lenders notify customers that the consumers
need to assess whether they can afford to repay additional credit and provide a
simple worksheet to assist consumers in determining how much debt they can
afford to repay.

b.     Banks

Provide Enforcement "Teeth" for Rules on Bank Sale of Non-Deposit
Products. Under current bank regulator guidelines, banks that sell non-deposit
products (e.g., insurance) must disclosure that those products are not federally
insured. However, regulators have limited authority to enforce these guidelines.
We would statutorily mandate disclosure and give regulators the authority to take
enforcement actions against violators.

c.    Rent-to-Own Companies

Disclosures and Other Requirements for Rent-to-Own Products. The
attraction of obtaining furniture, appliances, and other products with little down
has led to the rapid growth of rent-to-own firms; but some consumers do not
realize that under these arrangements they can pay many times the value of a
product. The FTC is near completion of a study of the rent-to-own industry. We
would support their findings, including, at a minimum, requiring basic disclosures
of whether a product is new or used and what the product's total cost would be
under the contract. In addition, we will work with states to ensure that any
federal rules do not interfere with state consumer protection efforts.

d.    ATMs

Mandate A TM Surcharge Disclosures. Many consumers will shop to avoid
A TM surcharges or pay less. Posted disclosure of surcharge fees on the
machine allows consumers to make a decision before the transaction begins, but
current law only requires that a disclosure be posted either on the machine or the
screen during the transaction. While most networks now require members to
post fee notices in both places, we would require this of all A TM owners making
it legally enforceable.


                                     2


                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

    Expand Disclosures for High LTV Mortgages. Increasingly, consumers with
    high credit card debts are being offered second mortgages to consolidate their
    debts, extend the time for repayment, and reduce the interest rate. These
    mortgages can result in debt levels of more than 125% of the home's value.
    Consumers may not understand the consequences of these refinances,
    especially that the failure to repay these consumer debts could lead to
    loosinglosing their home; and recent studies show that many such homeowners
    promptly incur new consumer credit debts. We would require that the lender on
    high loan-to-value second mortgages disclose that: (1) interest payments may
    not be deductible; (2) the consumer may be unable to resell the house unless
    they can repay the entire loan amount; and (3) default will result in foreclosure.

    Improve and Streamline Mortgage Disclosures under Truth-in-Lending Act
    (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). In July
    1998, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Board) and the
    Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUO) released a
    Congressionally-mandated study of how best to streamline the statutory
    disclosure requirements for mortgage loans and settlement services, with the
    goal of simplifying and improving the quality of information provided to
    consumers to enhance their ability to shop and increase competition. The report
    calls for a series of statutory reforms to RESPA and TILA to make the
    information provided to consumers more reliable, more timely, and more helpful
    in comparison shopping for all the services required to finance a home. We
    would adopt the HUD-Board recommendations.

   Ban Coercive Sales of Insurance Products. Mortgage lenders increasingly
    offer "credit life" insurance designed to ensure repayment of the mortgage in the
    event of the borrower's death or injury. The economic value to the consumer of
    these products is dubious. Moreover, there are widespread reports of coercive
    sales, i.e., lenders implying that a loan decision will be made or made more
    quickly if the insurance is acquired. Required disclosures appear to be
    ineffective at deterring such fraud. The HUD텯oard report recommended
    prohibiting the advance collection of lump-sum insurance premiums, so that
    consumers may pay premiums periodically and can terminate the insurance at
    any time, and so loan termination automatically cancels both coverage and
    liability for insurance payments. In addition, we would ban solicitation of credit
    life insurance during the pendency of a credit application.

     Fully Implement FTC-HELP and Consumer Sentinel. The Year 2000 will be
     the first year of operation for FTC's toll-free consumer hotline, part of the
     Commission's Consumer Response Center. The hotline will give consumers fast
     and easy access to information they need to protect themselves -- from tips
     about credit and debt collection to advice on how to avoid becoming a victim of
     fraud. Complaints to the hotline become part of the Consumer Sentinel, the
     FTC's fraud database, which is shared on1Y-with other law enforcers in the U.S.
     and Canada. By 2000, the Consumer Sentinel database is expected to be a
     primary tool in the fight against consumer fraud. (Included in FYOO budget)

     "Identity Theft" Enforcement Initiative. Last year, Congress enacted new
     laws barring the use of another's identifying information. The Treasury
     Department, in coordination with the Justice Department and regulatory
     agencies, will undertake a vigorous enforcement and prevention strategy to
     combat identity theft. [Need additional details from Treasury enforcement.]
     (Does not require legislation.)

     Ban "Pretext Calling." Widespread reports of private investigators and data
     brokers tricking financial institutions into providing confidential customer
     information led Chairman Leach to introduce legislation to end the practice. We
                                                                           th
     support the Senate version of the Leach bill, as we did in the 105 Congress.
     [FYI: We strongly prefer ihe version marked as marked up by the House
     Commerce Committee as opposed to the House and Senate Banking
     Committee versions, the latter require us to meet a high standard of proof
     including intent, which means we would not likely use the new law at all
     because the FTC Act unfair and deceptive trade practice authority does not
     impose such high standards.]

     Limit Consumer Liability for Non-PIN Protected Debit Cards. "Off-line debit
     cards" differ from on-line debit cards (a.k.a. ATM cards) because a customer
     authenticates the transaction by signing a paper slip (as with a credit card
     purchase) rather than entering a PIN. This creates a greater risk of unauthorized
     transactions through forged signatures. Card issuers have been encouraging
     consumers to use them instead of checks and replacing existing A TMs with
     cards with off-line features. Yet these debit cards only provide the lesser
     protections of other debit cards although they operate more like credit cards. We
     would limit consumer liability as it is currently limited for credit cards.

    Prohibit unsolicited mailing of loan checks. Loan checks are credit products
     for which the consumer need only sign and cash or deposit the check to obtain
     the loan. While generally offered to middle and upper income persons, the
     consumer is at risk for fraudulent endorsement of the check. For the same

      consumers from the hassle of contesting liability for stolen card purchases -- we
      would prohibit unsolicited mailing of loan checks.

4. Expand access to financial services


      Provide Low-Cost Banking Services to All Americans. We would expand the
      availability of low-cost, electronic banking accounts (ETAs), so that all Americans
      can have a low-cost, yet safe and sound account in which to deposit and save
      their money. The Treasury would pay for account establishment for Federal
      benefit recipients and fees to consumers would be limited. (The Treasury
      Department issued a proposed rule on January 7. Final due soon.)

      Provide Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) To Make It Easier for Low-
      Income Families to Save. IDAs allow low-income households to save not just
      for retirement but also for education, emergencies, homeo'.'mershiphome
      ownership, or business investment. Individual contributions can be matched to
      incent more savings. (The FYOO budget doubles funding for IDAs.)

5. Improve consumer financial education

    Launch a Campaign to Promote Education on Credit, Savings, and
     Investment. The President could direct the NEG to convene a high level
     interagency group to present him with a plan to raise financial literacy levels and
     to coordinate and expand the Administration's commitment to consumer financial
     education . . (Does not require legislation.)

     Create a Consumer Clearinghouse on Credit, Savings, and Investment. The
     Treasury will establish an easy-to-use government clearinghouse of resources
     for financial planning by building on existing agency web sites, to help
     consumers and interested groups locate financial education and planning
     resources. (Does not require legislation.) TENTATIVE
