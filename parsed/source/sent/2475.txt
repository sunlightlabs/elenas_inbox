MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                   Bruce Reed
                        Gene Sperling
                        Elena Kagan
                        Sally Katzen

SUBJECT:                State of the UnionlBudget Ideas

        This memorandum provides a brief description of new ideas we are considering for the
State ofthe Union. Most of these ideas involve increased spending, and you will have to make
choices among them as you consider the FY 2000 budget. Options relating to social security are
not included in this memo.

HEALTH CARE (DPC/NEC as specified below)

1. Long-Term Care Initiative. This package could include: (1) a tax credit of up to $1,000 .
for people with three or more limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) or their
caregivers, at a cost of about $6 billion over 5 years; (2) a plan for OPM to offer federal
employees a choice of high-quality private long-term care insurance policies at lower-than-
market prices; (3) a family caregiver support program, costing about $500 to $750 million
over five years, that would provide grants to states for "one-stop shops" to assist families
who care for severely impaired elderly relatives through counseling, training, and respite
services; and (4) a nursing home quality initiative, costing about $500 to $750 million over
five years, that would include new enforcement provisions ~, increased penalties), new
funds for surveys of repeat offenders and improved surveyor training, and perhaps a new
commission to oversee HCFA's nursing home enforcement efforts and to investigate other
kinds of facilities where health care is offered ~, assisted living facilities). (DPC/NEC)

2. Disability Proposals. This package could include: (1) the Jeffords-Kennedy Work
Incentives Improvement Act, which enables people with disabilities to go back to work by
giving them an option to buy into Medicaid and Medicare, at a cost of about $1.2 billion
over 5 years; (2) a tax credit of $1,000 to $5,000 for working people with disabilities to
assist them in paying for the costs associated with employment, at a cost of about $1 to 2
billion over 5 years; (3) a proposal, costing $50 million over five years, to promote the
deinstitutionalization of Medicaid beneficiaries by developing viable community-based care
alternatives for people residing in nursing homes after a "date certain"; and (4) a proposal
to make Medigap supplemental insurance more accessible to people with disabilities.
Other non-health related proposals focusing on disabilities include: a new competitive
grant program, developed by your disabilities task force, to increase the employment rate
of adults with disabilities, and efforts to ensure that new technologies are designed so as to
be accessible to people with disabilities. (DPCINEC)

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

 3. Prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. We are considering a variety of
 proposals to address the lack of coverage for prescription drugs in Medicare, including a
 means-tested Medicaid option, an approach that would apply only in managed care, a
 traditional benefit for all beneficiaries, and an unsubsidized purchasing mechanism that
 uses Medicare's size as leverage for drug discounts for beneficiaries. If desirable, a
 proposal could be included in the budget or coordinated with the March release of the
 Medicare Commission's recommendations. The cost varies significantly depending on the
 proposal, ranging from $1 to 20 billion a year. (DPC/NEC)

 4. Protecting beneficiaries from HMO withdrawals from Medicare. This year, a number
 of HMOs pulled out of Medicare with only a few months notice, leaving 50,000
 beneficiaries with no plan options in their areas. You announced that the Administration
 would develop legislation to prevent this behavior in the future, and we are currently
 reviewing the best approaches. (DPC/NEC)

5. Redesigning and increasing enrollment in Medicare's premium assistance program.
Over 3 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries are eligible but do not receive Medicaid
coverage of their Medicare premiums and cost sharing. Many more may not get enough
assistance through a new provision that is supposed to help higher income beneficiaries.
We are developing a range of proposals, costing up to $500 million over five years, to use
Social Security Offices to educate beneficiaries about this program, reduce administrative
complexity for states and give them incentives to engage in more aggressive outreach
efforts. (DPC/NEC)

6. Health Insurance Coverage Expansions. We could propose again, in somewhat new and
improved forms: (1) an initiative to encourage small businesses to form purchasing
cooperatives for health insurance, costing about $50 to 100 million over 5 years; (2)
proposals to improve outreach for children's health insurance; and (3) a proposal, more
limited than last year's, to provide a Medicare buy-in for certain people ages 55 to 65,
benefiting about 30,000 people and costing $500 million over 5 years. (DPC/NEC)

7. Biomedical Research. The scientific community is poised to make revolutionary
advances in the treatment of diseases. We should again propose an increased investment in
biomedical research -- perhaps (depending on how we treat tobacco money in the budget)
between $500 million and $1 billion. (DPC)

.8. Antibiotics (Super Bug) Initiative. Resistance to antibiotics is becoming a public health
 crisis, causing prolonged illnesses and even death. A new initiative, costing about $25 million
 each year, could address this problem through: (1) a major outreach and education campaign
 involving hospitals, health professionals, and managed care organizations; and (2) new research
 and surveillance efforts to understand where and why antibiotic resistance occurs and to develop
 effective responses. (DPC)

9. Bioterrorism Initiative. This initiative, costing $100-300 million each year, would: (1) train



                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

epidemic intelligence officers who can coordinate with state health departments to identify and
respond to attacks; (2) develop a mass casualty emergency response system that includes primary
care, emergency transportation, and decontamination abilities; (3) create and maintain a stockpile
of pharmaceuticals; and (4) improve research to deveiop new vaccines and antibiotics to be used
in the event of attack. (DPC)

10. Disease Initiatives. We are working on several initiatives designed to combat
particular diseases. These initiatives, which you could choose to do singly or in
combination, are: (1) an asthma initiative, which will curb recent steep increases in asthma
cases especially among young children, by disseminating new treatment guidelines to State
and local public health programs and encouraging them to work with schools, child care
organizations, businesses, and other community organizations; (2) a mental illness initiative
that will accompany a Surgeon General's report on this subject (and perhaps a White House
Conference recommended by Mrs. Gore) and will include pUblic-private partnerships to improve
access to prevention and treatment, reforms in federal health programs to improve delivery of
mental health services, and funding increases in the mental health block grant; and (3) a heart
disease initiative, which could include: a new partnership with aging networks to evaluate and
improve nutrition; efforts to measure successful prevention approaches and replicate them
nationwide; and the creation of a network of educators, churches, and community-based
                        a
organizations to launch nationwide awareness campaign. In each of these initiatives, the public
health efforts described above would supplement NIH funding of research projects. The
estimated cost of these initiatives is $50 million for asthma, $100 million for mental illness, and
$20 million for heart disease. (DPC)

11. Emergency Medical Services in Rural Areas. The presence of viable emergency
systems is critical for residents in rural areas, because of the high rates of injury associated
with jobs in these areas and the long distances to health providers. This proposal, costing
about $50 million, would provide funds to States and local communities to improve access
to 911 services or alternative emergency systems. It also would fund programs to help
rural communities train local citizens in CPR and first responder techniques and to recruit
and retain emergency personnel. (DPC)

12. Food Safety. We are working on a food safety initiative that will highlight safety
standards and enforcement. Included in this initiative are: (1) a repackaged and somewhat
modified legislative proposal giving the FDA and USDA additional enforcement powers
~, mandatory recalls and civil penalties); (2) additional food-specific regulations and/or
guidelines ~, for certain fruits and vegetables); and (3) more extensive adoption of our
model codes for restaurants and food service workers. In addition, we will focus on
improving coordination with state and local agencies that regulate food safety in order to
develop a wholly integrated national inspection system. (DPC)

TOBACCO (DPC)




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

1. State Menu. Our best vehicle for enacting tobacco legislation next year will be a
legislative waiver of federal Medicaid claims to the states' expected $200 billion settlement
with the tobacco companies. We will seek bipartisan agreement on a menu of uses for the
federal share of state money, with tobacco control and child care as our top priorities. We
will try to use this measure as a vehicle for other key elements of our tobacco policy, such
as FDA jurisdiction and warning labels. (Cost: In the end, this may be the way to get
Congress to pay for child care, but we do not recommend using this as the child care offset
in our budget.)

2. Price Increase. One of the most difficult budget decisions will be whether to assume a
tobacco tax increase in our budget request, and if so, what to do with the money.
Proponents argue that a substantial price increase is an essential part of our efforts to
reduce youth smoking, and we need the money to pay for new initiatives. Others argue
that once again using tobacco as a honeypot will hurt our ability to pass tobacco legislation
and undermine the credibility of our entire budget, since a big tax hike is unlikely to pass.
If we do assume tobacco revenue, the candidates for it include: (1) assistance to tobacco
farmers (about $1 billion a year); (2) the long-term care tax credit (about $1 billion a year);
(3) other tax cuts, such as a child care / stay-at-home tax credit and/or a reduction in the
marriage penalty; (4) NIH research; (5) public health programs; and (6) the Medicare trust
fund and/or a new prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.

EDUCATION (DPCINEC as specified)

1. Ending Social Promotion. Last year's budget proposal included $300 million for Education
Opportunity Zones in districts that agreed to remove bad teachers, tum around failing schools,
and end social promotions. The proposal required authorization, which Congress will never give
us. For next year, we recommend a simpler approach that uses existing authority and focuses
entirely on ending social promotion. We would like to expand our after-school program from
$200 million to $700 million and give a disproportionate share of this money to districts that end
social promotion. These school districts could use the money (as Chicago does) to provide extra
help after school and mandatory summer school for students who need it. (Cost: $200 million
above FY99 budget.) (DPC)

2. Teacher Quality and Recruitment. Now that we're on track to begin hiring 100,000 new
teachers to reduce class size, we have an even greater responsibility to help communities attract
talented new teachers to the profession. We envision a five-part strategy on teacher quality and
recruitment: (l) a $100 million increase in the teacher recruitment scholarships we enacted this
year in the Higher Education Act, which would put us on course to attract 60,000 new teachers at
high-need schools over the next five years; (2) a $60 million initiative -- modeled after the
successful Troops-to-Teachers program -- that would help states expand alternative certification
routes and attract talented people from other professions, such as military personnel and
employees in firms being downsized; (3) a nationwide crackdown on teacher education schools,
including new regulations authorized by the Higher Education Act to require report cards for

                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

education schools; (4) a $50 million increase in the Eisenhower program to send secondary
school teachers who teach outside their field back to college to take additional courses in the
subjects they're teaching, coupled with a new requirement that new secondary teachers pass
competency tests in a subject before they can teach it; and (5) a high-profile effort to help states
make the most of the 15 percent set -aside for teacher quality in the recently passed class size
legislation. (Cost: about $210 million above FY99 budget). We are also exploring a politically
interesting counter to private school choice: vouchers for private school teachers -- i.e., an
incentive program to encourage private school teachers to teach in public schools. (DPC)

3. Work-Site Schools. One of the most promising new education ideas sprouting up around the
country is the creation of public schools located at work sites, designed primarily to serve
employees' children. School districts provide the teachers and curriculum; companies provide
facilities and upkeep. These schools-at-work serve a host of objectives at once, by (1) providing
new facilities at no cost to the district, (2) increasing parental involvement in the schools and
parental satisfaction in the workplace; (3) reducing employee turnover and absenteeism; and (4)
increasing school diversity, because work sites are more diverse than residential neighborhoods.
We propose a $50 million increase in an existing magnet school program to provide grants to 50
communities to launch work-site schools. We also are working with Treasury to develop a tax
credit for businesses that start on-site schools, similar to the Kohl business tax credit for on-site
child care that is already in our budget. (Cost: $50 million for start-up grants. No estimate yet
for tax credit, but it will be very small.) (DPC)

4. Expanding public school choice. As support grows for private school vouchers, we must
continue our efforts to expand choices within the public schools. Charter schools are one
answer, and we recommend a $20 million increase, to $120 million, to keep us on track to 3,000
charter schools by 2002. Work-site schools are another. We also recommend increased funding
for (1) an existing grant program that helps urban and suburban school districts reduce racial
isolation by fonning interdistrict magnet programs; and (2) magnet schools on university
campuses, especially in urban areas. (Cost: $25 million for 10 interdistrict magnet programs;
$15 million for 10 university-based schools.) (DPC)

s.  School leadership academies. Research has shown that an effective principal is the single
most important indicator of school success, yet little has been done at the national or state level
to improve the management skills of principals. We propose a small initiative to create school
leadership academies that would provide training in management, teacher evaluation, school
discipline, and other areas to elementary school principals in high-poverty districts. (Cost: $50
million) (DPC)

6. Class size. To stay on course to reach 100,000 new teachers in seven years, we will ask for
$1.3 billion in the FY2000 budget. We are planning an ambitious rollout of the class size
initiative over the next year, as we award first-year funding, issue guidance to local districts on
how the program works, and so on. We also will press Congress to restore the local matching
requirement and strengthen the provisions to require competency testing of new teachers. (DPC)



                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                          . Hex-Dump Conversion

FAMILIES AND CHILDREN (DPC)

1. Expansion of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (old policy). We propose to
expand the Child Care and Development Block Grant as we did in the FY 1999 Budget. The
block grant is the primary federal child care subsidy program, helping low-income working
families to pay for child care. Currently, between one and two million children are served by the
program, leaving roughly nine million children who are eligible but unserved. This proposal
would cost at least $7.5 billion over five years.

2. Tax Relieffor Parents, Including Parents who Stay at Home. We are considering
replacing our last year's proposal to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit with a new
proposal to benefit all parents, including those who stay home. This change will address the
criticism that our child care initiative did little for stay-at-home parents. We are reviewing
proposals to (1) double the child tax credit to $1,000 per child for all children under the age of
four, at a cost of about. $12 billion over five years, or (2) increase the standard deduction for each
child under the age of three by $1,000, at a cost of about $3 billion over five years. Each of these
proposals can be dialed up or down by adjusting either the age threshold or the dollar amount.

3. Tax Credit for Businesses Providing Child Care. We could again propose to provide a tax
credit to businesses that provide child care services for their employees. The credit, which
covers 25% of qualified costs but may not exceed $150,000 per year, costs $500 million over 5
years. To further build on this concept, we also propose to provide tax credits to businesses that
provide on-site schools (see education section).

4. Parent Paid Leave Plan. Many workers cannot afford to take unpaid leave following the
birth or adoption of a child, even though they have access to an unpaid leave policy through
FMLA or voluntary employer benefit plans. To address this problem, we are considering a
proposal to provide eligible parents who already have access to unpaid leave with partial wage
replacement for a set period of time. The cost of the program, which would be administered
through the Unemployment Insurance System, varies according to the selected eligibility criteria.
 Ifwe choose, for example, to give $200 per week for four weeks to new parents with median
income (about $37,000) or below, the cost will be about $875 million for FY 2000 (including
start-up and administrative expenses).

5. FMLA Expansion to Businesses with 25 Workers (old but unarticulated policy). Under
current law, workers are eligible for FMLA coverage only if they work at a business with 50 or
more employees and if they have worked at least twelve months and 1,250 hours for the
employer. In your last State of the Union, you called for covering more workers under the
FMLA, but did not fully articulate how you would do so. We could now advance a specific
proposal to lower the FMLA threshold to 25 or more workers, which would expand coverage for
up to ten million more American workers.



                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Durnp Conversion


6. Parent Education and Support Fund. We are considering proposals to create a competitive
grant program administered by HHS to fund parent education and support programs, including
home visitation programs and "second chance maternity homes" to support teen mothers and
teach parenting skills. This fund could cost about $500 million over five years.

SERVICE (DPC)

1. AmeriCorps Seniors. In the wake of John Glenn's return to space, we have an opportunity
to give other senior citizens a mission. We propose adding $25 million to the current
AmeriCorps program to create a senior corps of 10,000 volunteers to serve as tutors and
mentors and in afterschool programs. We would build on a successful demonstration program
that recruits seniors to serve 15-20 hours per week over a fixed period of time in schools and
other community centers. In exchange, seniors would be eligible for small incentives, including
awards to participate in senior learning programs. By inspiring responsibility among seniors, this
initiative would provide an ideal complement to Social Security reform. John Glenn has
expressed some interest in playing a role in AmeriCorps now that he's retired. We could invite
him back to the State of the Union and place him in charge of a national effort to inspire seniors
to serve. (Cost: $25 million)

2. Expand AmeriCorps. We propose expanding the AmeriCorps program from its current
level of 50,000 members per year to approximately 70,000 per year, with the goal of reaching
100,000 per year by the end of this Administration. These additional members could be targeted
to serve primarily in after-school and summer school programs. (Cost: $75 million)

3. Expand Service Component of Work-Study Program. Nearly 1 million students now receive
federal work-study funding. Despite our efforts, colleges and universities are required to
use only 7 percent of their work-study money for students employed in community service.
 The higher education lobby would object, but we could propose a substantial increase in
that requirement -- e.g., phasing it up to 25 percent over the next 3 years.

COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT (DPC/NEC for all)

1. CDFI Tax Credit. We are looking at a proposal to extend tax incentives to encourage
investment in CDFIs, which would leverage additional private investment in distressed areas and
stimulate the economic revitalization of those areas. Under the proposal, $100 million in non-
refundable tax credits would be made available to the CDFI Fund to allocate among equity
investors in qualified CDFls using a competitive process.

2. Microcredit Initiative. We are working to identify means to increase support for
micro enterprise finance, both domestically and internationally. We are examining whether to
build on Senators Kennedy's and Domenici's PRIME legislation which would provide technical
assistance to microenterprise. We are also looking at increased funding for CDFI initiatives

                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

specifically targeted to microenterprise, and CRA and other regulatory reform designed to
enhance bank lending to microenterprise funds. On the international side, we are looking at
whether we can increase microenterprise funding through USAID or MDBs, especially to
countries hardest hit by the financial crisis.

3. Clean Water, Parks, and Communities Bonds. We are examining three proposals to
encourage "green" infrastructure projects. The first model uses the same financing mechanism as
your school construction proposal for a menu of projects: protecting and improving water
quality; cleanup of contaminated sediments; waterfront reclamation and revitalization;
storm water runoff control; purchasing of green spaces to prevent sprawl; park enhancements and
revitalization, and brownfields cleanup. The second model, which provides a smaller incentive
than the first model, would create new tax-exempt bond authority for these state and local areas
to invest in clean water, parks, and communities. The advantage of this model is that it builds on
the current system of bond finance. The final model would allocate tax credits (like the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit) to states and local areas to provide to the developers of these green
infrastructure projects.

4. Employment Tax Credits. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit and the Welfare-To-Work
Tax Credit encourage employers to hire and retain members of certain economically
disadvantaged targeted groups. Both credits will expire on June 30, 1999. Under this proposal
the two credits would be made permanent.

5. Re-Develop 10,000 Abandoned Buildings. Abandoned buildings are a symbol of urban
blight, and an action plan to turn this around will be a powerful signal of change. We are
examining different proposals to help re-develop 10,000 abandoned buildings, combining
several existing programs or providing grants or tax incentives to spur private-sector
redevelopment of these sites.

6. Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and Regional Affordable Housing Initiative. Last year,
you proposed a 40-percent expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to spur the private
sector to develop more affordable rental housing for low-income Americans. We recommend
that you again ask Congress to take this action, which would restore the value of the credit to its
1986 level and help develop an additional 150,000-180,000 affordable housing units over the
next five years. This proposal would cost $1.6 billion over five years. At ,the same time, you
could propose a Regional Affordable Housing Initiative to increase the availability of affordable
housing in areas with high growth in low-skilled jobs and inadequate supplies of housing for
low-income workers. This proposal could be funded through HUD's HOME program and would
cost $125 million over five years.

7. Homeownership Tax Credit. We are examining two kinds of tax credits to promote
homeownership among lower-income families, who generally do not benefit from the mortgage
interest deduction. The first proposal would use the model of the Low-Income Housing Tax
Credit to create a Low-Income Homeownership Tax Credit. Under this proposal, low-income


                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

families would receive a low- or zero-interest second mortgage, which would reduce their
up front costs ~, downpayment and closing costs) and investors would receive tax credits in
return. The second proposal is a $5,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers in Empowerment
Zones or Enterprise Communities.

8. Housing for the Elderly Initiative. This proposal is designed to improve housing for
elderly people and thereby provide an alternative to nursing home care. In addition to providing
capital to improve and modify such housing to meet the needs of elderly residents, the initiative
would provide housing vouchers for low income elderly who live in housing developed through
the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. Because the tax credit helps subsidize rent, this proposal
would allow us to leverage our resources and provide more vouchers to the poor elderly.,

9. Incremental Tenant-based Section 8 Vouchers. To build on our success in this past year's
budget, we recommend seeking an additional 50,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers and
another 25,000 vouchers to meet the needs of the homeless, including elderly homeless and
homeless veterans.

CRIME (DPC)

1. Crime Bill II. The 1994 Crime Act will expire at the end of the FY 2000 budget cycle,
guaranteeing that the next Congress will consider major crime legislation. We recommend that
you get a jump on this debate by using your State of the Union and FY 2000 budget to challenge
Congress to pass a new crime bill that builds on the core elements of the successful 1994 Act --
more police, tougher punishment, and better prevention. Most of the money required is already
built into future budgets; continuation of the COPS program, however, will require new funds
totaling about $1 billion. We believe that a new Crime Act should include the following
elements:

      C,ommunity-Oriented Policing and Prosecution Services (COPPS). Your pledge to
       help fund 100,000 more police is likely to be fulfilled before the end of next summer. A
       new COPPS initiative (note the extra "P" for "Prosecution"), costing about $1.4 billion in
       the first year, could include funds to: (1) hire, redeploy, and retain an estimated 7,500
       more police each year; (2) provide modem technology and equipment and support
       training in modem policing techniques, with a special emphasis on "hot spots"
       technology; (3) hire, train, and equip prosecutors to join local police in fighting crime on
       a more community-based, pro-active basis; and (4) support partnerships between law
       enforcement and community-based groups to prevent crime in their areas.

      A new focus on probation supervision and coerced abstinence. The punishment title
       of the crime bill now focuses largely on prison construction; we recommend shifting the
       focus to a new "Certainty of Punishment" initiative that will support the expanded use of
       probation supervision and of drug testing and treatment.




                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

      Gun initiatives. A new crime bill should include your longstanding firearms priorities --
       juvenile Brady, Brady II, federal CAP legislation and child safety locks. It also could
       include new proposals to: (1) close the loophole that exempts many firearms sales at gun
       shows and flea markets from Brady background checks; (2) expand the Youth Crime Gun
       Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) -- to trace all crime guns and investigate gun traffickers --
       to an additional 20-40 cities; and (3) assemble gun strike forces -- teams of federal
       prosecutors and ATF agents, acting with local law enforcement -- to target cities with
       high levels of gun violence and crack down on gun traffickers.

      Values-based crime prevention initiative. In addition to other crime bill prevention
       programs, we could invest in promoting values-based crime and violence prevention
       efforts, such as those of Rev. Eugene Rivers. Funds from this program would go to
       comprehensive prevention programs run by faith-based and other institutions seking to
       instill and reinforce common sense values in troubled youth.

2. Safe, Disciplined, and Drug-Free Schools. At the White House Conference on School
Safety, you announced that you would overhaul and strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free
Schools Program. Under this proposed reform, funds will be appropriately targeted to
schools with serious drug and crime problems, and schools will have to adopt rigorous,
comprehensive school safety plans that include: tough but fair discipline policies, such as
zero tolerance for guns and drugs; safe passage to and from schools; effective drug and
violence policies and programs; annual school safety and drug use report cards; links to
after school programs; efforts to involve parents; and crisis management plans. We also
could include in this package (1) funds for states that adopt a policy of drug testing first-time
applicants for drivers' licenses and (2) funds for school districts that adopt a policy of drug
testing middle and high school students with parental consent. We believe that these reforms
will require up to $450 million iri new funding in FY 2000.

3. Parity for Substance Abuse Treatment. Appropriate substance abuse treatment
remains unavailable to nearly half of the people who need it. To help fill this treatment
gap, we could propose legislation to encourage parity between substance abuse treatment
and other medical benefits. Similar to the Mental Health Parity Act signed into law in
1996, a current draft of this legislation would prohibit health care plans that provide a
substance abuse' benefit from setting annual or lifetime dollar limits on this benefit at a
lower level than those for other medical and surgical benefits. At the same time, we would
have to ensure that federal health programs provide parity between substance abuse
treatment and other medical benefits; we are still exploring the cost of any necessary
reforms to these programs.

4. Binge Drinking. We are working on a number of proposals regarding alcohol abuse,
including (1) promoting a voluntary code for alcohol advertisements directed toward
minors; (2) banning alcohol billboards near schools; (3) discouraging alcohol advertising
on youth-oriented web sites; (4) and funding educational efforts about the dangers of



                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

alcohol consumption.

WELFARE REFORM AND CHILD WELFARE (DPC)

1. Reauthorize the Welfare-to-Work Program. Congress authorized the Welfare-to-Work
Program for only two years; if we wish to continue our current investment in the hardest-to-
employ, we will have to propose a reauthorization of about $1.5 billion annually. Within this
funding level, we propose several set-asides, totaling $500 million, for the following specific
purposes: (I) work-based English-language literacy projects for immigrants and others; (2) work-
based substance abuse testing and treatment programs; (3) employment services for welfare
recipients with disabilities; and (4) a work-based program to promote responsible fatherhood,
including efforts to increase low-income fathers' employment and earnings and ensure that they
provide financial and other support to their children.

2. Child Support. One initiative, costing just a few million dollars each year, would
increase the prosecution of egregious child support violators by establishing multi-agency
teams, orking with state and local law enforcement, to identify, analyze, and investigate
cases for prosecution. A pilot project of this kind is already under way in five states; this
proposal would put these units in place all across the nation within the next several years.
A second initiative would seek legislation exclude doctors and other health care providers who
are delinquent in child support from the Medicare program or from programs offering health
professional loans.

Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers and Tax Credit -- see COMMUNITY
EMPOWERMENT Section

3. Children "Aging Out" of Foster Care. Each year, nearly 20,000 18-year-olds "age out" of
the public child welfare system. Federal financial support for these young people ends just at the
time they are making the critical transition to adulthood. Areas for increased investment for
these young adults include: (I) expanding the independent living program, which provides
services to foster care children in this age group; (2) expanding the transitional living program, a
competitive grant program that funds community-based organizations that provide services to
this population, including housing support; and (3) giving states the option of using Federal
Medicaid dollars to provide health care coverage for this population. (Cost: roughly $150
million each year)

4. Adoption Registry. We are working on plans to create an Internet-based adoption registry of
foster care children waiting to be adopted, so that prospective adoptive parents can learn about
these waiting children. Funding this registry would require very smally increase in HHS's
Adoption Opportunities Grant Program.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
