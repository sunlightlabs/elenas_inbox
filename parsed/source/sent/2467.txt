           PRESIDENT CLINTON RELEASES REPORT DOCUMENTING ACTIONS FEDERAL
        GOVERNMENT IS TAKING TO IMPLEMENT A PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS AND URGES
         VOTERS TO SEND BACK A CONGRESS THAT SHARES HIS COMMITMENT TO PASS
               LEGISLATION TO ASSURE PROTECTIONS FOR ALL HEALTH PLANS
                                    November 2,1998

    Today, President Clinton urged voters to send back a Congress that shares his commitment to passing a
    strong enforceable patients' bill of rights next year. The President also emphasized that while the Republican
    Leadership has stalled on the patients' bill of rights, the Administration has been doing everything possible to
    implement these protections in Federal health plans. To that end, he unveiled a report from the Vice
    President documenting action that the Federal government is taking within its authority to implement the
    patients' bill of rights in the health plans it administers or oversees. Today, the President:

    Criticized RepUblican Leadership for allowing Congress to adjourn without passing a strong patients'
    bill of rights. For a full year, the President has been calling on the Congress to pass a strong enforceable
    patients' bill of rights. For months, the Republican Leadership used every possible stall tactic to thwart the
    patients' bill of rights. When the Republican Leadership finally did introduce a bill, their proposal contained
    more loopholes than patient protections. It did not contain critical protections such as access to specialists
    and offered false promises such as an appeals process that left the decisions in the hands of HMO
    accountants. In fact, Senator Lott would not even allow an up or down vote to be held on this issue.

    Urged voters to choose a Congress committed to passing a meaningful patients' bill of rights. President
    Clinton committed to doing everything possible to pass a strong patients' bill of rights in the next Congress
    and urged Americans to go to the polls tomorrow to elect a Congress that shares this commitment. This
    legislation should include enforceable patient protections, such as access to specialists, coverage of
    emergency room services when and where the need arises, continuity of care protections, an internal and
    independent external appeals process to appeal decisions made by HMO accountants, and protections to
    assure that HMOs are held accountable when patients are harmed or injured due to a health plans' decisions.

    Released report from the Vice President that highlighted that while the Republican Leadership
    delayed, the Administration is acting to implement patient protections in Federal health plans. In
    February, the President directed Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the
    Department of Defense Military Health Program, and the Veteran's Health Program -- which serve over 85
    million Americans -- to, where possible, come into compliance with the patients' bill of rights outlined by
    the President's Quality Commission. Today, the Vice President released a report highlighting that these
    agencies have taken all the action within their statutory authority to implement patient protections. As a
    result, the Federal health plans are now, or soon will be, in virtual compliance with the patients' bill of rights.
     The report documents that:

          The 285 participating heai.th plans, covering nine million Federal employees and their
           dependents, have been directed to implement new patient protections this year. The Office of
           Personell Management (OPM), which oversees the Federal Health Employees Benefits Program
           (FEHBP) serving nine million Federal employees and dependents, has directed their 285 participating
           health plans to come into compliance with the patients' bill of rights. Through their annual call letter,
           OPM has specifically requested that plans implement new protections including access to specialists,
           continuity of care, disclosure of financial incentives, and access to emergency room services. Finally,
           OPM has issue new regulations to prevent "gag clauses." OPM is also sending information to
           beneficiaries to assure they are fully aware of their new patient protections.


                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion



     The 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are benefitting from critical patient protections.
      Building on Medicare's commitment to provide essential patient protections, HHS published an
      Interim Final rule, in June, that includes a series of new patient protections for Medicare
      beneficiaries. When this rule is fully implemented, Medicare will be virtually in compliance
      with the patients' bill of rights including new protections such as access to emergency services
      when and where the need arises, patient participation in treatment decisions, and access to specialists.

     The 38 million Medicaid beneficiaries are being assured essential protections in the patients'
      bill of rights. In September, the Health Care Financing Administration published a Notice of
      Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) adding new patients protections for Medicaid beneficiaries,
      such as access to specialists and an expedited independent appeals process to bring the program
      in compliance with the patients' bill of rights, where possible.

     Over eight million Americans will receive the protections in the patients' bill of rights by the
      end of this year as a result of the new policy directive assured by the Defense Department's
      Military Health System (MHS). In response to the President's directive, DoD issued "The Patients'
      Bill of Rights and Responsibilities in the Military Health System," a major policy directive to all
      participants in the MHS. This directive outlined new protections for the over 8 million beneficiaries
      served by MHS, including access to appropriate specialists for women's health needs and chronic
      illnesses and rights for the full discussion of treatment options and of financial incentives. With this
      directive, which will be fully implemented by the end ofthis year, DoD will now be in compliance
      with the patients' bill of rights.

     Over three million veterans are or will soon be assured virtually all patient protections. In July,
      the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) issued an Information Memorandum to participating health
      providers announcing its intention to have an external appeals process in place by the end of the year.
       Similarly, DV A established a task force to make recommendations as to how best implement
      information disclosure requirements consistent with Commission's recommendations and has
      developed a new brochure to provide beneficiaries the necessary information. With the
      implementation of these new protections DVA is in virtual compliance with the patients' bill of rights
     The 125 million Americans covered by ERISA still are not assured critical patient protections
      because the Department of Labor does not have the authority to implement them without
      legislation. DoL oversees the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), governing
      approximately 2.5 million private sector health plans, that cover about 125 million Americans, issued
      a new regulation to implement an expedited internal appeals process and information disclosure
      requirements. However, DoL's report underscores that unless Congress passes Federal legislation,
      they do not have the authority to implement most patient protections.




                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
