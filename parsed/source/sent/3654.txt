        Last year, in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, the Supreme Court ruled
unconstitutional a provision in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) that pennitted tribes to
sue states in federal court for negotiating in bad faith under IGRA. The decision raises questions
as to what remedies exist for tribes if a state refuses to negotiate in good faith.

        In May 1996, the Interior Department issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(ANPR) to gather comments from interested parties on how to enforce the obligation of states to
bargain with tribes in good faith following the Seminole decision. Part of the proposal would
give the Interior Department authority to impose a remedy -- including pennitting tribal gaming
-- when a state is found to have negotiated with a tribe in bad faith. The ANPR closed in July
1996. The Interior Department, however, has not yet made a recommendation.

       The NGA opposes any move by the Secretary of the Interior to pennit gaming, even as a
remedy for bad-faith bargaining, in the absence of a tribal-state compact. This matter is still
under review in the Interior Department, and the Administration as yet has no position.

         30 percent rule. The NGA opposes the current requirement that 30 percent of income be
.paid as rent and opposes even more strongly increasing the 30 percent figure: The
 Administration supports the current 30% requirement, but does not support raising that
 requirement.

        Section 8 Assistance. The NGA supports preservation of the existing Section 8 system.
The Administration disagrees, on the ground that failing to refonn the current system is not
financially feasible. The Administration has called for a "mark-to-market" system that should
make the Section 8 program more efficient.

       The Administration generally concurs with the NGA's other proposals on affordable
housing.

       Denial of benefits to legal immigrants. See separate sheet on Welfare Implementation
proposals.

        Cuban-Haitian entrants. The Administration strongly supports the NGA's
recommendation that Cuban-Haitian entrants be treated as "refugees" as provided under the
Fascell-Stone amendment. The Administration opposed the provision in the welfare bill that put
an end to that parity.

        Waiver of oath. The NGA calls on Congress to waive the oath for individuals who are
incapable of communicating the desire to naturalize. The Administration has not yet taken a
position on this issue.

        Education of undocumented children. The NGA favors reimbursement by the federal
government to the states for educational services provided to undocumented children. The
Administration supports education for such children and opposes the proposal for reimbursement
(the "Son-of-Gallegly amendment").

       Alien registration. The NGA proposes annual registration of all legal immigrants in the
United States. The Administration opposes this proposal.

       Refugee services and resettlement. The Administration will review the questions of          .
allowing each state to privatize refugee resettlement and of extending the period of eligibility for
refugee services from eight to twelve months, as proposed by the NGA. These proposals should
be considered within the context of the 1997 reauthorization of the Refugee Act, and the
Administration welcomes the Governors' inputin that endeavor.

      The Administration generally concurs with all of the NGA's other positions on
immigration and refugee policy.

        Funding. The Administration agrees with the NGA that both discretionary and
mandatory funds should be funded at full authorization levels and that funding for the Social
Service Block Grant should be maintained.

       Flexibility. The Administration recognizes that states want maximum flexibility in setting
payment rates and defining administrative costs. The Administration is in the process of
developing regulations on these and other issues and will take these recommendations into
consideration.

         Standards. The Administration opposes the NGA's proposal to amend current law
requiring states to set standards for all federally funded child care providers in three key areas:
minimum health and safety training; the prevention and control of infectious diseases (including
immunizations); and building and premises safety. The Administration believes that current law
strikes the right balance in allowing states to set the actual standards in these areas, while ensuring
that some standards are required.

        Assistance to Legal Immigrants and Refugees. The NGA proposes that legal immigrants
who cannot become citizens because of age or disability should not lose SSI or food stamps. The
Administration has criticized the welfare law's denial of SSI, food stamps, and other benefits to
legal immigrants generally. Our budget proposal, however, differs from the NGA's proposal in
approach. On SSI, we would exempt all disabled individuals from the ban -- not only those
whose disability has prevented naturalization. We would, however, retain the SSI ban on the
aged. On food stamps, we would delay until later this year the benefit cuts affecting all legal
immigrants -- not only the aged or disabled. We would not, however, offer any permanent
exemptions from the food stamp cuts. Finally, next week the INS expects to issue a regulation
and guidance that will allow certain legal immigrants with disabilities to waive citizenship tests.

        The NGA's proposal that legal immigrants who have applied to become citizens keep
benefits during that waiting period is impermissible under current law, but the Administration
would be supportive of a legislative fix along these lines.

        The NGA proposes that aged and disabled refugees not lose SSI and food stamps after
five years ofresidence. Our budget proposal would lengthen the time period to seven years for
SSI, but not food stamps.

        Flexibility in TANF block grant. The Administration generally agrees with the NGA's
desire to maintain funding and flexibility in the TANF block grant. The Administration,
however, has the responsibility to interpret terms in the statute such as "eligible families" and
"assistance" and will release guidance on this issue shortly. In addition, the Administration as
yet has no position on the NGA's proposal that states be permitted to transfer more funds
between T ANF and Social Services Block Grant.

        Restrictions on maintenance-of-effort funding. The Administration also generally agrees
that the mass of federal restrictions should not apply to state maintenance-of-effort dollars. But
the Administration is committed to ensuring that states not use their MOE programs as a way to
evade the statute's work requirements. The Administration will issue administrative guidance
and seek a legislative clarification to prevent such evasion, while otherwise supporting broad
state discretion over maintenance-of-effort funds.

       Cash assistance. The Administration has concerns about the NGA's position that only
cash assistance should trigger the time limit and other federal requirements. Such a position
could cause states to use vouchers and other devices to avoid these requirements. However, the
Administration has not yet released guidance on this issue.

        Waivers. The Administration concurs generally with the NGA's position that states
should be able to operate under existing waivers. The Administration believes, however, that
states should not use waivers to evade the fundamental requirements of the law for work and
time-limited assistance. The Administration has told states that, although the law permits them

                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
waivers are being used to evade the purpose of the law.

       Work requirements. The Administration does not support the NGA's proposal to count
more activities toward the work requirements (additional weeks of job search and job readiness,
education, drug and alcohol treatment). The Administration supports the law as written in this
area.

         Information System Requirements. The Administration does not support the NGA's
proposal to reduce reporting requirements under the welfare law. The Administration has not yet
reached a decision on whether to exclude reporting and other similar costs from the definition of
administrative costs. The Administration also has not reached a position on the NGA's proposal
that the Federal government provide funding and technical assistance to create an interstate
tracking system for time limits, but probably will agree to support technical assistance to the
states. The Administration does not support NGA's proposal for additional Federal funds for
states to implement the law's information systems requirements; the Administration believes that
the flexibility of the block grant should allow states to create necessary information systems.

       Administrative costs. The Administration has not yet taken a position on the definition of
administrative costs. HHS is currently working on a regulation that would define this term.

      Good faith efforts. The Administration does not support the NGA's proposal that states
making "good faith efforts" to comply with the law should not be subject to the law's penalties.
HHS, however, will enforce penalties in a way that is sensitive to the challenges states are facing.

        Contingency Fund. The Administration as yet has no position on the NGA's proposal to
allow states to draw down more per month from the fund. The Administration opposes the
NGA's proposal to relax the maintenance of effort requirement associated with the Fund. The
Administration is sympathetic to the NGA's concern that certain states may get inappropriately
low match rates under certain circumstances, but has not yet taken any action in this area.

        Maintenance of Effort Requirement for SSI State Supplements. In the past, the
Administration has opposed the NGA's proposal to repeal the maintenance of effort requirement
for state supplements to the SSI program. Disability groups oppose this proposal.

         The governors recognize the important progress toward national health care reform made
by the Kassebaum-Kennedy law, including administrative simplification and encouragement of
private long-term care insurance. The governors contend that in the absence of national health
care reform, states should be allowed broad flexibility in developing reform policies. In
particular, governors would like to have greater flexibility under ERISA to preserve the state's
role in regulating health care insurance of all health plans, including plans that "self-insure" and
multiple employer welfare arrangements. We are generally supportive of this approach, but have
not proposed specific legislative initiatives.

     The Administration generally concurs with the NGA's resolutions on HIV/AIDS.

        Many of the governors' long-tenn care proposals are consistent with initiatives in the
President's budget. For example, the governors ask for greater flexibility to enroll dual eligibles
in managed care, and the President's plan would ease the waiver process for states to implement
managed care. The governors ask that HMO payments be adjusted to encourage expansion of
Medicare managed care, and the President's proposal would move toward a more unifonn
payment rate -- so that areas receiving excessive payments get less while areas receiving lower
payments get more. Also, initiatives to improve access and affordability of private long-tenn
care insurance are consistent with past actions by the Administration. For example, the
governors' desire to improve consumer protections and improve the affordability of long-term
care builds on the accomplishments set forth in the Kassebaum-Kennedy law. The
Administration is generally supportive of such initiatives as long as they do not excessively
increase the cost of insurance plans.

        Not surprisingly, the governors seek to gain greater flexibility in administering the
Medicaid program. In particular, the governors: (1) oppose a cap on federal Medicaid payments,
(2) desire continued distribution of funding for disproportionate share payments through states,
rather than federal formulas, (3) endorse greater state flexibility in moving to managed care and
in using home and community-based waivers, (4) favor a repeal of the Boren amendment, (5)
support federal, rather than state, responsibility for the costs of dual eligibles, and (6) encourage
coordination with states to reach children eligible for Medicaid, who are not yet emolled.

        Although the President and the govern~rs agree on a number of proposals (e.g., greater
flexibility to move to managed care, a repeal of the Boren amendment, and a coordinated effort
with states to enroll eligible children), there are two issues on which there is disagreement.

        First, the President's budget will include a cap on federal Medicaid payments to protect
excess growth. The governors will likely assert that there is no need to cap future federal
Medicaid payments given recent declines in program growth. Currently, the NGA is considering
two options on such expenditure caps: (1) to oppose any cap on Medicaid spending or (2) to
oppose only those caps that do not provide for adequate state flexibility. We believe, however,
that we can make the per capita cap more acceptable to the states by providing them with
additional flexibility to administer the medicaid program.

        Second, the President's budget will reduce disproportionate share payments, and we are
currently considering allocation models that make certain that dollars go directly to facilities that
serve a high proportion of uninsured or underinsured individuals and/or a significant number of
Medicaid beneficiaries.

        The NGA urges Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment guaranteeing victim's
rights. The President has announced his support for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing
victims the right to be notified, to receive restitution, receive reasonable protection measures, and
to be heard at sentencing and parole hearings.
