MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed
                       Melanne Verveer
                       Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:               White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning

       As you know, on Thursday, April 17, you and the First Lady will host the White House
Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain
Tells Us About Our Youngest Children. This memorandum provides an overview of the
Conference, as well as summarizing recommended policy announcements.

Conference Overview

       The Conference will spotlight new scientific findings about how children develop, and
explore how we can make the most of this information to give children what they need to thrive.
The Conference will provide an opportunity to showcase what your Administration already has
accomplished in this area, such as increasing investments in scientific research and creating or
improving programs like Early Head Start and Wrc.

        The Conference will consist of two roundtable discussions, one in the morning and one in
the afternoon, with a luncheon in the State Dining Room (optional for you) in between the two.

        Morning session: You and the.First Lady will make remarks to open the Conference.
Yours will discuss the importance of the issue, note past Administration accomplishments, and
discuss proposals for improving child care and children's health (detailed below).

       A panel of experts will then present an overview of the emerging knowledge, gained from
neuroscience and behavioral science, on early childhood development. Dr. David Hamburg,
President of the Carnegie Corporation, will moderate brief presentations by:

      Dr. Donald Cohen, Director of the Yale Child Study Center, who will discuss what the
       behavior of children shows about their cognitive, emotional, and social development;

      Dr. Carla Shatz, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who will
       explain how children's brains develop in the earliest years of life; and

      Dr. Patricia Kuhl, Chair of the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at the

                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

        University of Washington, who will discuss how children learn language.

 Following these presentations, three more experts will join the panel to discuss what the
 scientific research suggests about protecting children's health and providing good child care:

       Dr. Ezra Davidson, Drew University of Medicine, who can address the importance of
        prenatal and perinatal services;

       Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, Harvard University, who can discuss the pediatrician's role in
        early childhood development; and

       Dr. Deborah Phillips, Institute of Medicine, who can address how child care can affect
        early development.

  These experts also will respond to a series of questions posed by the First Lady and Mrs. Gore.
  Some of these questions will come from a poll conducted by Hart Research for Zero to Three (an
  early development advocacy group) that tried to discover what parents most want to know about
  early childhood development. Other questions will tackle the tough issues raised by the new
  research -- for example, "does this research mean that women should not work?" or "does this
. research suggest that adopting an older child is a bad idea?"

       Afternoon Session: The purpose of the afternoon session is to highlight model efforts
that communities are undertaking to support parents and enhance early childhood development.
This panel will be action-oriented and will give you an opportunity to highlight Administration
accomplishments and new initiatives. Participants in the discussion will include:

       Dr. Gloria Rodriguez, Avance Family Support Program, San Antonio, TX.
        Avance is a widely acclaimed family support and education program serving
        predominantly Hispanic communities.

       Harriet Meyer, Ounce of Prevention, Chicago, IL.
        Ounce of Prevention is a statewide program in Illinois that develops innovative early
        childhood programs and runs model Early Head Start and child care programs.

       Melvin Wearing, ChiefofPolice, New Haven, CT.
        Wearing will discuss a pioneering initiative that trains community police officers to use
        child development principles in their work.

       Arnold Langbo, The Kellogg Company CEO, Battle Creek, MI.
        Kellogg launched a community-wide effort last fall to provide practical early brain
        development information to every Battle Creek parent and caregiver.




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dwnp Conversion

       Rob Reiner, CastleRock Entertainment, Los Angeles, CA.
        Reiner will discuss the "I Am Your Child" campaign launched this month and the media's
        role in making early childhood development information available.

       Governor Bob Miller, Nevada, Co-chair of the NGA Children's Task Force.
        Miller will discuss what States are doing to enhance early childhood development.

         Satellite Sites: The morning session of the Conference will be transmitted to 53 satellite
sites -- mostly universities and hospitals -- in about 30 states and all 10 federal regions. (Fifty-
three is only the current number; there will probably be more.) In almost all of these sites, local
organizers will put on programs of their own to follow the morning session and will report back
to you on their proceedings and recommendations. Cabinet Affairs is encouraging subcabinet
officials to attend and speak at these satellite conferences. In addition, regional administrators
from HHS, USDA, EPA, Education, and GSA are taking an active role in the satellite sessions.

        Report of Proceedings: We are currently making arrangements for an official conference
report. This report, in addition to providing a summary of the conference proceedings, will serve
as a resource guide and learning tool for parents and child care providers. We expect to print
250,000 copies and distribute them through departmental programs, such as Head Start and Even
Start, and to those who request information about the Conference.

Pre-Conference Policy Initiatives

      We would like to make three announcements prior to the Conference, in order to lay the
groundwork for the Conference's discussion of ways to enhance early childhood development.

         FMLA Expansion for Federal Employees: In your April 12 radio address, you will
introduce the themes of the Conference and then direct heads of executive departments and
agencies to expand family and medical leave for federal employees in the ways proposed in your
legislation. This action would allow federal employees 24 hours of unpaid leave each year to
participate in activities relating to school and child care, children's health care, and (unrelated to
the Conference) elderly relatives' health needs. You will stress in your radio address how such
family-friendly policies can support parents with young children.

        Prescription for Reading: On April 16, the First Lady (and perhaps you, depending on
the status of budget negotiations) will announce an initiative to encourage pediatricians to
"prescribe" that parents read to their children. As part of this initiative, the American Academy
of Pediatrics will announce that prescribing reading to infants and toddlers should be part of
standard pediatric care. In addition, several book companies have committed to donating
hundreds ofthousands of books for distribution to children through community health centers
and other medical offices across the nation. This initiative reinforces the Parents as First
Teachers portion of the America Reads program.




                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

       Executive Order on Environmental Health and Safety Risks: You currently have
under consideration a proposed Executive Order that would require agencies to consider and
explain the effects of certain major rules on children. This order, if you decide to approve it,
would serve as an excellent lead-in to the Conference, and we recommend issuing it on April 16.
The order gives meaning and effect to your Administration's commitment to protect children in
making regulatory decisions.

Conference Policy Announcements

        Your principal opportunity to discuss policy initiatives at the Conference will come
during your opening remarks. We recommend that these remarks focus on child care and
children's health care and that you make the announcements discussed below. In addition, you
will have an opportunity to make some announcments -- for example, on Head Start and
community policing-- during the afternoon session of the Conference, when you respond to
participants on the panel.

        Child care: Child care experts believe the Defense Department's child care system
is now the best in the country and possibly the world (in large part because of legislation
enacted in the late 1980s). DoD child care is characterized by: high standards, including a
high percentage of accredited centers; a strong enforcement system with four unannounced
annual inspections and a 1-800 hot line for parents to report concerns; a wage structure
that is tied to training and an "up or out" personnel policy requiring completion of training
requirements; relatively generous wages and benefits, which reduce staff turnover; a
system of linking up individual home care providers; and sufficient funding to make
quality child care affordable (though there still are waiting lists).

        We recommend you hold up the DoD child care system as a model for the nation
and issue an executive memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to use the
Department's resources and expertise to improve child care across the nation. In
particular, you would direct that (1) each military child development center "adopt" a
civilian child care center and work with it to improve quality; (2) DoD establish regional
"Child Care Masters Programs" that civilian child care managers could attend for two
weeks to learn best practices; (3) military bases partner with state and county governments
to provide on-the-job training in child care to welfare recipients; (4) DoD publicize its
model designs for child care facilities and playgrounds; and (5) that DoD issue benchmarks
in the areas of standards, enforcement, compensation, and cost against which civilian child
care programs could evaluate themselves. Most civilian child care systems will come up
short against DoD's benchmarks, particularly in terms of compensation and affordability,
but such a comparison might help build public support for greater investment in child
care.

      You also might want to float some trial balloons on more ambitious -- and costly--
proposals. For example, some have suggested making the Child and Dependent Tax Care


                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

Credit refundable (at a cost of $2-4 billion), so that families with little or no income can
benefit from it. The Blue Dog budget makes the credit refundable, but pays for it by
eliminating the tax benefit for families with incomes over $100,000. Another legislative
proposal would provide a tax credit to private companies and institutions to encourage
them to build quality child-care centers on-site. Given our budget, you cannot endorse any
of these proposals, but you might want to use this opportunity to suggest your openness to
further discussion of such legislation.

       Children's Health Initiative: We also recommend that you discuss in your opening
remarks the importance of insurance coverage for children's health and development,
highlighting the Children's Health Initiative in your 1998 budget proposal. Your proposal will
extend coverage to up to 5 million uninsured children by the year 2000. You can announce at the
Conference that the deans of academic medical centers -- important legitimators within the
medical community -- have endorsed your proposal.

       We are also planning a follow-up children's health event, where you will release a study
showing the links between insurance coverage, health status and development and learning for
children from 0 to 18 years old and talk in more detail about your health proposal. Either at the
follow-up event or at the Conference itself, you can announce a project by Kaiser Permanente to
spend $100 million over the next 5 years to provide health insurance to uninsured children.

        Child Victims of Violence Initiative. You can announce that the Department of
Justice will establish, with FY 97 discretionary funding, a Child Victims of Violence
Initiative through the Yale, New Haven Child Development-Community Policing Program.
 This program, which Chief Waring will speak about, trains police officers in child
development, so that they can better respond to situations arising in the field. The new
initative will extend the program to other sites and also broaden it to include people other
than police officers -- such as prosecutors, probation and parole officers, and mental health
professionals -- whose work would benefit from knowing about early child development.

       Head Start Funding: You can announce, perhaps in response to Harriet Meyer's
comments during the afternoon session, the launch of a new competition for Head Start
(including Early Head Start) grants.

         America Reads Challenge Early Childhood Kits: You will announce the release of the
America Reads Challenge Early Childhood Kits for Families and Caregivers. The kits suggest
developmentally appropriate activities for children ages 0 to 5, a calendar listing ideas for daily
activities, and a developmental growth chart. Everyone who looks at these kits loves them. The
kits will be distributed to early childhood programs across the nation and through requests by
callers to the Department of Education's 1-800 phone line.

      CEO Summit: You can announce that Kaiser Permanente and other companies will
convene a CEO Summit in the fall of 1997 to discuss what businesses can do to enhance early



                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                   6

     childhood development -- for their own employees, for the communities in which they have a
     presence, and even for their customers. In making this announcement, you can challenge the
     CEOs to address at the Summit certain issues raised at the White House Conference.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
