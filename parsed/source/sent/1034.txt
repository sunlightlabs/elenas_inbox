MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     RAHM EMANUEL
                          BRUCE REED
                          ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:                  UNIONIZATION OF SECRET SERVICE UNIFORMED DIVISION

        You will meet tomorrow with Gil Gallegos and other officers of the Fraternal Order of
Police (FOP). They may ask you, as they have before, whether you will amend an Executive
Order to allow employees of the Secret Service Uniformed Division to unionize and engage in
collective bargaining. This memo provides you with the arguments on each side of the issue, so
you can decide how to respond to inquiries.

        Before his departure, Jack Quinn conducted an extensive review ofthis issue and
recommended changing the Executive Order in the way the Uniformed Division employees
requested. The Department of Treasury is strongly opposed to this approach. We believe a
sensible compromise proposal is available, but Treasury has rejected this compromise and we do
not know how the Uniformed Division employees would greet it.

Background

       Federal law gives the President authority to issue an order prohibiting the employees of
any federal unit that "has as a primary function, intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or
national security work" from organizing and collective bargaining. Using this authority,
President Carter issued Executive Order 12171, which precluded the Secret Service Uniformed
Division from engaging in these activities. The E.O. also covered many other units in the
Departments of Treasury, Defense, Justice, Transportation and Energy.

       In March and May 1995, members of Congress (Reps. Trafficant, Frank, Conyers, and
Torres) wrote to you requesting that you exempt the Secret Service Uniformed Division from the
E.O., allowing employees ofthis division to unionize. The White House referred the letters to
the Department of Treasury, which advised the Congressmen and two interested unions that
national security concerns required the ban to remain in effect. In September 1995, Judge Mikva
affirmed this determination, citing a policy of deference to the Treasury Department on matters
relating to the security of the President and Vice President.

     Last year, Jack Quinn received a letter from the Secret Service Uniformed Division Labor
Committee of the FOP asking for reconsideration ofthis issue. The letter stated that "national


                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

security concems ... are being used as a convenient way to deny the members of the Uniformed
Division fundamental labor rights." Quinn initiated discussions with Treasury Department
officials and Uniformed Division employees.

       In a September 1996 FOP questionnaire for presidential candidates, you referred to the
controversy and stated: "To make a decision on this issue in as thoughtful and expeditious a
manner as possible, I have asked my counsel ... to look into the competing arguments, and
present a recommendation to me."

       At a later meeting with the Executive Board of the FOP, you were careful not to commit
yourself, but did express sympathy for the position of the Uniformed Division employees. The
Wall Street Journal quoted you as saying at that meeting that "it would be the height of hypocrisy
for me not to support [the right to unionize] for federal officers." Members of the FOP left the
meeting generally encouraged.

       Quinn recommended before he left that the Administration grant the Uniformed Division
employees'request. Secretary Rubin, however, vehemently opposed this recommendation, and
the matter did not come to you for decision.

        As consideration of the issue has proceeded, Gallegos and employees of the Uniformed
Division have accused Uniformed Division management of retaliating against union supporters.
One incident resulted in a lawsuit brought by the officers alleging various constitutional
violations. In addition, Gallegos has come under increasing pressure from his membership to
move forward on this issue.

Department of Treasury Arguments

        The Department of Treasury offers three reasons for opposing unionization. First,
Treasury claims that the obligation to bargain will compromise security by decreasing
management's authority over such matters as the deployment and scheduling of officers and the
selection of equipment. Treasury cites the decision to close off Pennsylvania Avenue to traffic as
an example. That decision affected many employees' schedules and work assignments. Without
a union, the Division could take this action unilaterally; with a union, the Division might first
have had to bargain about .the proposed change, thereby losing flexibility and causing delay.

         Second, Treasury argues that unionization will compromise security by forcing the
disclosure of information during collective bargaining. Treasury notes that information about
security procedures and techniques-- about postings, manpower allocations, equipment, and so
forth-- is now provided on a "need to know" basis. If the Division were obligated to engage in
collective bargaining, Treasury argues, it would have to provide such information to union
members and officials and possibly to arbitrators.

       Third, Treasury argues that exempting the Uniformed Division from the E.O. will place


                                              Automated Records Management System
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

the government on a slippery slope toward exempting other covered employees or eventually
eliminating the E.O. Treasury is particularly concerned that if the Uniformed Division are free to
unionize, then the special agents of the Secret Service, who directly protect you, the Vice
President, and your families, will request identical treatment.

Uniformed Division Employees' Arguments

         The argument in favor of allowing employees of the Uniformed Division to organize
starts from a simple premise: this Administration is committed to safeguarding the rights of
employees to organize and engage in collective bargaining. This commitment should be upheld
unless there is a strong countervailing interest.

       In considering whether such an interest exists, you should note that there is no danger that
unionization will lead to work stoppages of essential employees. A federal statute makes it an
unfair labor practice for a union to strike at any federal agency. This statute would apply to
Uniformed Division personnel just as it does to other federal employees.

         Although Treasury is right that the obligation to bargain will limit its unfettered authority
over workplace decisions, it is not nearly so clear that this obligation will compromise security
interests. With respect to a number of issues, such as benefits, the obligation to bargain will have
little or no effect on security. With respect to more sensitive issues, bargaining often will not be
required. Agencies can take certain actions involving hiring, assignments and the like -- actions
implicating "management rights" -- without engaging in collective bargaining. If this authority is
insufficient, Treasury can negotiate contract provisions giving it additional powers. And if even
this is not enough, we can reserve still greater powers to Treasury through adoption of the
compromise proposal discussed below.

        Similarly, Treasury's concern about the disclosure of sensitive information seems
overstated. The officers in the Uniformed Division already have most of this information -- or at
least could obtain it if they all pooled their knowledge. Moreover, the Treasury Department
could condition providing such data in collective bargaining on an agreement by the union to
confidentiality requirements.

        Finally, Treasury's "slippery slope" argument is subject to question. If exempting another
unit from the E.O. would pose a greater danger to security than exempting the Uniformed
Division, then the Administration should be able to justify continued coverage of that unit. For
this reason, all four other agencies with covered employees declined to support Treasury's
argument, stating that their employees could be distinguished from Uniformed Division
personnel.

Compromise Proposal

       An alternative course is to amend the E.O. to allow Uniformed Division employees to



                                             Automated Records Management System
                                             Hex·DID1IP Conversion




                                                                                                      4

     unionize, but to give them fewer collective bargaining rights than other unionized federal
     employees have. This approach should not be difficult to accomplish. When you came into
     office, you signed an executive order requiring the agencies to bargain over certain subjects that
     they previously did not have to bargain over. ill modifying the E.O. to allow unionization of
     Uniformed Division employees, you could make clear that the old rules apply to these
     employees. These rules would give the Treasury Department greater authority to act unilaterally
     -- without any consultation with the employees' union -- than federal agencies now have. It
     would go some way toward accommodating both the employees' desire for unionization and the
     agency's concerns about security.
