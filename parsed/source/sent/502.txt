MEMORANDUM FOR ALL HEADS OF EXECUTNE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

        Since I signed the historic welfare reform law, I have urged businesses, non-profit
organizations, and religious groups across the nation to help make its promise of opportunity real
by offering jobs to welfare recipients. We are making great progress, but there is more to do.
And today, I take action to ensure that the federal government, as the nation's largest employer,
contributes to the greatest extent possible to this national effort.

        I therefore direct each of you, as head of an agency or department, to use all available
hiring authorities, consistent with statute and prior executive memoranda, to hire people off the
welfare rolls into available job positions in the government.

        In particular, I direct you to expand the use of the Worker-Trainee Program and other
excepted service hiring authorities. The Worker-Trainee Program allows agencies to quickly and
easily hire entry-level persons for up to three years, with the ability to convert the appointment to
career status 'if the employee has performed satisfactorily. Though recently underutilized, the
program allows agencies to bypass complex federal personnel hiring rules and procedures to
bring people into the most junior grades of the workforce.

       I further direct you, in recognition of the different characteristics of the various agencies'
workforces, to prepare an individualized plan for hiring welfare recipients and to submit that plan
to me within 30 days. This plan should have three principal components:

      The plan should contain a survey indicating in which divisions and for which particular
       positions your agency can most easily hire welfare recipients.

      The plan should describe in detail how the agency intends to recruit and hire qualified
       welfare recipients. This description should include a proposed local outreach program,
       building upon the government's existing nationwide employment information systems, to
       bring federal job opportunities to the attention of welfare offices, state and private
       employment offices, nonprofit organizations, and others that work with welfare recipients
       on a regular basis.

      The plan should describe in detail how the agency will ensure that welfare recipients,
       once hired, perform well enough to keep their jobs. The agency should include in this
       aspect of the plan proposals for on-the-job training and/or mentoring programs.

       I expect each agency head to report to me about his or her plan at a special cabinet
meeting called for that purpose. Following this meeting, I also expect monthly reports on
implementation.

       To ensure deep and continuing involvement in this issue by the White House, I ask the
Vice President to take on the project of overseeing this effort. Based on his expertise in federal


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

                workplace issues, he will assist all agencies in carrying out their commitments.

                        Finally, I direct appropriate agencies to take three steps that will assist all low-income
                federal employees, whether or not former welfare recipients.

                      I direct each agency head to notify all employees eligible for the Earned Income Tax
                       Credit (EITC) of both their eligibility and their ability to receive EITC monies each
                       month in their paychecks. Currently, not all agencies inform qualifying employees of
                       their eligibility and options for payment.

                      I direct the General Services Administration (GSA) to issue within 30 days guidelines
                       regarding use of the Federal Fare Subsidy Program, including the option to offer fare
                       subsidies based on the employee's income. This option, which agencies may not now
                       realize they have, will enable more agencies to participate in the Fare Subsidy Program.

                      I direct the GSA, after consultation with all federal agencies, to report back to me within
                       30 days on plans to assist low-income federal workers in finding affordable child care.
                       This report shall include information on agency-sponsored child care centers and agency
                       contracts with local child care resource and referral services, as well as recommendations
                       on any appropriate expansion of these arrangements to provide assistance to low-income
                       federal workers.
