Karen:

Elena asked that I send you a note to let you know that we spoke to ONDCP,
and that they said that General McCaffrey is committed to doing a press
availability on the 10M-Medical Marijuana study tomorrow. After two years
of pointing to the study, he feels obligated to go on the record when it
is released -- and, despite our suggestion, is not willing to pull back.

I have attached McCaffrey's proposed statement and the Q&A prepared by his
staff.  If you still have concerns about the press availability, you or
John will probably need to connect w/him directly. As you know, he
doesn't feel obliged to take guidance from us on this or any other matter
he views as his responsibility.

Jose'

1.   Does this report validate the message sent by voters in California, Arizona, Alaska,
     Washington,. Oregon, Nevada?

    I've said before that using the ballot to decide what should become medicine is like
     asking the voters to make air traffic control decisions. We have always said and we
     continue to affirm that science, not the ballot box, should determine the practice of
     medicine.

    The report says that it is impossible to estimate the clinical value of marijuana and
     cannabinoids based on anecdotal reports. (Page 1.19 rOM Report) This report does not
     address the political process that makes marijuana available to medically needy
     individuals. And, it doesn't address public policy questions such as the distribution of
     marijuana. But, the sense of the report indicates that distribution marijuana through
     places like Cannabis Buyers clubs would be inconsistent with sensible scientific
     practices.


2.   Will ONDCP's position on the medical use of marijuana change as a result of this
     report?

    Actually this report supports ONDCP's position, as it highlights the need for targeted
     research on the compounds in marijuana that may be helpful to those in medical need.

    Medical advancement means rigorous testing before a new drug is released to the public.
     To recognize this reality is not to shut out the possibility of merit in the cannabis plant but
     it is to reject exaggerated, at times !llagical, claims for marijuana.


3.   The very first recommendation of the 10M study is to conduct more research into
     the effects of cannabinoids. Yet it is impossible to get marijuana in order to conduct
     research. Will you use the influence of your position to see that access to marijuana
     is placed on the "fast track" so that legitimate researchers can conduct the research
     called for in the 10M study?

    The Federal government has established a process for detennining the safety and efficacy
     of drugs. It is a process that has been in place and has proven to work. r will continue to
     work with NIDA and FDA and Nlli to ensure that this process is efficient and still
     protects the American public.
       that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of
       other illicit drugs." What does this say about the "Gateway Theory" that you have
       held?

      The study actually supports the fact that most drug users begin with nicotine, move to
       alcohol, and then to marijuana. The new point brought out in this report is that the use of
       marijuana for medical purposes does not fall into the "gateway theory."

     The significant point is that this study says that we need more research to determine just
      exactly where and how research on the compounds of marijuana should be conducted.


5.     Now that the 10M has concluded that there are potential medical benefits to
       marijuana, will the Federal government continue to arrest and incarcerate sick
       people who use the drug for pain relief?

     There is nothing in the 10M report that concludes that there are benefits to smoked
      marijuana. In fact, the 10M report states that "smoked marijuana is unlikely to be a safe
      medication for any chronic medical condition." (Page 3.48)

     This question goes to the crux of the problem. On one hand, we have people who want
      an excuse to smoke marijuana to get high, claiming that they have debilitating medical
      conditions. On the other hand, we have a small group of terminally ill people who
      believe (rightly or wrongly) that marijuana offers them some relief.

     Federal law enforcement policy will continue to be as it has been--focused on drug
      traffickers.

     What we really need is for pharmaceutical companies to develop alternative delivery
      systems for the compounds in marijuana.


6. Will you now concede that there is medicinal value to marijuana?

     The 10M report raises serious questions about the medicinal value of smoked marijuana.

     We've always supported the use of synthetic THC--dronabinol--in treating certain
      illnesses. The issue is smoked marijuana.

     What we need are alternative delivery systems to ensure that those few people who can't
      take dronabinol have an effective means of deriving whatever benefits are available in
      THC without the harmful effects of smoke.

Wednesday, March 17,1999                                                       (202) 395-6618

             WHITE HOUSE DRUG POLICY OFFICE ISSUES STATEMENT
                    ON INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE'S REPORT
                       ON MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE

(Washington, D.C.) - The White House Office of National Drug Policy (ONDCP) issued the
following statement today following the release of the Institute of Medicine's report
Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base:

In January 1997, ONDCP asked the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review of the scientific
evidence for assessing the potential health benefits and risks of marijuana and its constituent
cannabinoids. ONDCP believed that an objective and independent ev;lluation of research
regarding the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes was appropriate given the ongoing debate
about cannabis and its health effects.

The report released today by the Institute of Medicine represents the most thorough analysis to
date of the relevant scientific literature. It summarizes recent advances in molecular and
behavioral neuroscience, in particular newly elaborated systems of transmitters, receptors, and
antagonists - all illuminating the physiological effects of cannabinoids. The Institute of
Medicine has addressed all issues that ONDCP requested be examined, including: the science
base and gaps in scientific knowledge regarding use of marijuana for medicinal purposes;
scientific information about marijuana's mechanism of action; peer-reviewed literature on the
uses ofmarijuana; and costs associated with various forms ofthe component chemical
compounds in marijuana and other pharmacotherapies for special medical conditions. We thank
the principal investigators, members of the advisory panel, biomedical and social scientists,
patients, advocates, report reviewers, and all who supported the Institute of Medicine in
developing this comprehensive report.

The report contains six specific recommendations that address:

I. Continued research into the physiological effects of cannabinoids.

2. Clinical trials of cannabinoid drugs for symptom management.

3. Evaluation of psychological effects of cannabinoids in clinical trials.

4. Studies of individual health risks in smoking marijuana.

5. Clinical trials of marijuana use under limited circumstances for medical purposes.

6. Short-term use of smoked marijuana under strict conditions for patients with debilitating
   symptoms.

                               Press Release Approved by the Director
          ..

                                               Press Release Approved by the Director




               These recommendations are supported by the following observations:

                  Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoids for pain relief, control
                   of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation. This value would be enhanced by a rapid
                   onset of drug effect

                  The psychological effects of cannabinoids are probably important determinants of their
                   potential therapeutic value. They can influence symptoms indirectly, which could create false
                   impressions of the drug effect or be beneficial as a form of adjunctive therapy.

                  Numerous studies suggest that marijuana smoke is an important risk factor in the
                   development of respiratory diseases, but the data that could conclusively establish or refute
                   this suspected link have not been collected.

                  Because marijuana is a crude THC delivery system that also delivers harmful substances,
                   smoked marijuana generally should not be recommended for medical use. Nonetheless,
                   marijuana is widely used by certain patient groups, which raises both safety and efficacy
                   Issues.

                  If there is any future for marijuana as medicine, it lies in its isolated components -- the
                   cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives. Isolated cannabinoids will provide more
                   reliable effects than crude plant mixtures. Therefore, the purpose of clinical trials of smoked
                   marijuana would not be to develop marijuana as a licensed drug, but such trials could be a
                   first step towards the development of rapid-onset, non smoked cannabinoid delivery systems.

               ONDCP appreciates the contributions made by the Institute of Medicine to the debate on the
               medical efficacy and safety of cannabinoids. We will carefully study the recommendations and
               conclusions contained in this report. We will continuc to rely on the professional judgement of
               the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director ofthe National Institutes of Health,
               and the Surgeon General on all issues related to the medical value of marijuana and its
               constituent cannabinoids. We note the report's conclusion that "the future ofcannabinoid drugs
               lies not in smoked marijuana, but in chemically-defined drugs that act on the cannabinoid
               systems that are a natural component of human physiology." We look forward to the considered
               responses from our nation's public health officials to the interim solutions rec~mmended by the
               report.
