               TALKING POINTS ON APPLICATION OF MINIMUM WAGE

        This Administration is committed to moving people from welfare to work. But this
         Administration is also committed to making sure that workers get paid at least the
         minimum wage for their efforts.

        That means all workers -- whether or not they come off the welfare rolls. No one doing
         real work should be paid a subminimum wage.

        You know as well as I that there are complicated legal questions here, involving who
         counts as a "worker" and who as a "trainee" under the minimum wage law.

        But you should know that we will apply the law consistent with its intent -- to protect
         American workers and to make sure that no employer can take advantage of people's
         need.


                      TALKING POINTS ON TEXAS PRIVATIZATION

        You know that we are considering Texas's proposal to privatize substantial parts of its
         Medicaid and food stamp operations.

        We have talked with AFSCME leaders often on this issue, and I know Administration
         officials will talk with you again this week,

        No final decisions have been made. But I can assure you that this Administration will do
         what is best for recipients of public assistance, and that this Administration will look out
         for the interests of the workers who devote their lives to helping those recipients. If the
         Texas scheme is inconsistent with those goals, then we will not permit the State to
         proceed.
