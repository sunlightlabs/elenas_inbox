     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                     RAHM EMANUEL
                               BRUCE REED
                               ELENA KAGAN

     SUBJECT:                  UNIONIZATION OF SECRET SERVICE UNIFORMED DIVISION

             You will meet tomorrow with Gil Gallegos and other officers of the Fraternal Order of
     Police (FOP). They may ask you, as they have before, whether you will amend an Executive
     Order to allow employees of the Secret Service Uniformed Division to unionize and engage in
     collective bargaining. This memo provides you with the arguments on each side of the issue, so
     you can decide how to respond to inquiries.

             Before his departure, Jack Quinn conducted an extensive review of this issue and
     recommended changing the Executive Order in the way the Uniformed Division employees
     requested. The Department of Treasury is strongly opposed to this approach. We believe a
     sensible compromise proposal is available, but Treasury has rejected this compromise and we do
     not know how the Uniformed Division employees would greet it.

     Background

            Federal law gives the President authority to issue an order prohibiting the employees of
     any federal unit that "has as a primary function, intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or
     national security work" from organizing and collective bargaining. Using this authority,
     President Carter issued Executive Order 12171, which precluded the Secret Service Uniformed
     Division from engaging in these activities. The E.O. also covered many other units in the
     Departments of Treasury, Defense, Justice, Transportation and Energy.

             In March and May 1995, members of Congress (Reps. Trafficant, Frank, Conyers, and
     Torres) wrote to you requesting that you exempt the Secret Service Uniformed Division from the
     E.O., allowing employees of this division to unionize. The White House referred the letters to
     the Department of Treasury, which advised the Congressmen and two interested unions that
     national security concerns required the ban to remain in effect. In September 1995, Judge Mikva
     affirmed this determination, citing a policy of deference to the Treasury Department on matters
     relating to the security of the President and Vice President.

          Last year, Jack Quinn received a letter from the Secret Service Uniformed Division Labor
     Committee of the FOP asking for reconsideration of this issue. The letter stated that "national

                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                      2

     security concernS ... are being used as a convenient way to deny the members of the Uniformed
     Division fundamental labor rights." Quinn initiated discussions with Treasury Department
     officials and Uniform~d Division employees.

            In a September 1996 FOP questionnaire for presidential candidates, you referred to the
     controversy and stated: "To make a decision on this issue in as thoughtful and expeditious a
     manner as possible, I have asked my counsel ... to look into the competing arguments, and
     present a recommendation to me."

            At a later meeting with the Executive Board of the FOP, you were careful not to commit
     yourself, but did express sympathy for the position of the Uniformed Division employees. The
     Wall Street Journal quoted you as saying at that meeting that "it would be the height of hypocrisy
     for me not to support [the right to unionize] for federal officers." Members of the FOP left the
     meeting generally encouraged.

            Quinn recommended before he left that the Administration grant the Uniformed Division
     employees' request. Secretary Rubin, however, vehemently opposed this recommendation, and
     the matter did not come to you for decision.

             As consideration of the issue has proceeded, Gallegos and employees of the Uniformed
     Division have accused Uniformed Division management of retaliating against union supporters.
     One incident resulted in a lawsuit brought by the officers alleging various constitutional
     violations. In addition, Gallegos has come under increasing pressure from his membership to
     move forward on this issue.

     Department of Treasurv Arguments

             The Department of Treasury offers three reasons for opposing unionization. First,
     Treasury claims that the obligation to bargain will compromise security by decreasing
     management's authority over such matters as the deployment and scheduling of officers and the
     selection of equipment. Treasury cites the decision to close off Pennsylvania Avenue to traffic as
     an example. That decision affected many employees' schedules and work assignments. Without
     a union, the Division could take this action unilaterally; with a union, the Division might first
     have had to bargain about the proposed change, thereby losing flexibility and causing delay.

              Second, Treasury argues that unionization will compromise security by forcing the
     disclosure of information during collective bargaining. Treasury notes that information about
     security procedures and techniques-- about po stings, manpower allocations, equipment, and so
     forth-- is now provided on a "need to know" basis. If the Division were obligated to engage in
     collective bargaining, Treasury argues, it would have to provide such information to union
     members and officials and possibly to arbitrators.

            Third, Treasury argues that exempting the Uniformed Division from the E.O. will place



                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                             3

       the government on a slippery slope toward exempting other covered employees or eventually
       eliminating the E.O. Treasury is particularly concerned that if the Uniformed Division are free to
       unionize, then the special agents of the Secret Service, who directly protect you, the Vice
       President, and your families, will request identical treatment.

       Uniformed Division Employees' Arguments

                The arguinent in favor of allowing employees of the Uniformed Division to organize
       starts from a simple premise: this Administration is committed to safeguarding the rights of
       employees to organize and engage in collective bargaining. This commitment should be upheld
       unless there is a strong countervailing interest.

               In considering whether such an interest exists, you should note that there is no danger that
       unionization will lead to work stoppages of essential employees. A federal statute makes it an
       unfair labor practice for a union to strike at any federal agency. This statute would apply to
       Uniformed Division personnel just as it does to other federal employees.

                Although Treasury is right that the obligation to bargain will limit its unfettered authority
       over workplace decisions, it is not nearly so clear that this obligation will compromise security
       interests. With respect to a number of issues, such as benefits, the obligation to bargain will have
       little or no effect on security. With respect to more sensitive issues, bargaining often will not be
       required. Agencies can take certain actions involving hiring, assignments and the like -- actions
       implicating "management rights" -- without engaging in collective bargaining. If this authority is
       insufficient, Treasury can negotiate contract provisions giving it additional powers. And if even
       this is not enough, we can reserve still greater powers to Treasury through adoption of the
       compromise proposal discussed below.

               Similarly, Treasury's concern about the disclosure of sensitive information seems
       overstated. The officers in the Uniformed Division already have most of this information -- or at
       least could obtain it if they all pooled their knowledge. Moreover, the Treasury Department
       could condition providing such data in collective bargaining on an agreement by the union to
       confidentiality requirements.

               Finally, Treasury's "slippery slope" argument is subject to question. If exempting another
       unit from the E.O. would pose a greater danger to security than exempting the Uniformed
       Division, then the Administration should be able to justify continued coverage of that unit. For
       this reason, all four other agencies with covered employees declined to support Treasury's
       argument, stating that their employees could be distinguished from Uniformed Division
       personnel.

               Finally, you should note that the Capitol Police do have a right to unionize as a result of
       the passage of the Congressional Accountability Act last year. The FOP and other unions are
       now bidding to represent these police officers.


                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

              Compromise Proposal

                      An alternative course is to amend the E.O. to allow Uniformed Division employees to
              unionize, but to give them fewer collective bargaining rights than other unionized federal
              employees have. This approach should not be difficult to accomplish. When you came into
              office, you signed an executive order requiring the agencies to bargain over certain subjects that
              they previously did not have to bargain over. In modifying the E.O. to allow unionization of
              Uniformed Division employees, you could make clear that the old rules apply to these .
              employees. These rules would give the Treasury Department greater authority to act unilaterally
              -- without any consultation with the employees' union -- than federal agencies now have. It
              would go some way toward accommodating both the employees' desire for unionization and the
              agency's concerns about security.




                                                                             Automated Records Management System
