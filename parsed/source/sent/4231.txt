     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                    BRUCE REED
                              MIKE COHEN

     SUBJECT:                 Proposed Budget Initiatives for Indian Education

             Last July, a coalition of education-oriented groups from Indian Country proposed a
     Comprehensive Federal Indian Education policy statement, which emphasized the importance of
     Tribal governance of Indian Education, the preservation and revitalization of Native languages
     and cultures, and the need for equitable access to education resources. The coalition also
     proposed an Executive Order to implement this policy vision,

            This proposal has been under review by DPC staff and the Domestic Policy Council
     Working Group on American Indians and Alaska Natives. Pending a determination as to
     whether the proposed Executive Order is desirable and likely to be effective in accomplishing its
     aims, we have begun to identify steps that can be taken right now to improve education for
     Native American students in schools controlled by the BIA and Tribes, as well as in the public
     schools attended by large numbers ofIndian students,

             The full set of initiatives we have developed is summarized below. Most involve
     ensuring that new education proposals and existing funding streams effectively target resources
     to schools in Indian Country. In one area -- school construction and maintenance -- we are going
     further by proposing a significant increase in funds over previous appropriations levels.

     Tribal School Construction Proposal

             The BIA operates 185 residential and day schools serving 51,000 Native American
     students, approximately 10% of all Native American students in grades K-12. Enrollment in all
     BlA schools has increased by 25% since 1987. Enrollment injust the day schools has increased
     47% since 1987 and 24% since 1992. Consequently, BIA schools have experienced significant
     problems with overcrowdi"ng. In addition, according to a forthcoming GAO report, BIA schools,
     compared to schools nationwide, (1) are generally in poorer physical condition; (2) have more
     "unsatisfactory environmental factors"; (3) more often lack key facilities required for education
     reform (e.g., science labs); and (4) are less able to support computer and communications
     technolo~W Overall, they are in worse condition than even inner-city schools.

             We are recommending an increase of$51.4 million over the FY 1998 appropriations (and
     an increase of $47.6 million over the Department of Interior FY 1999 request) for two Bureau of




                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dwnp Conversion
    ..




                                                                                                                2

         Indian Affairs accounts for New School Construction and Facilities Improvement and Repairs.
         The proposed increase would double funding for new school construction and for significant
         improvements and repairs of existing facilities. Compared to the BIA FY 1999 request, this step
         would double the number of new schools to be built from 2 to 3, and increase the number of
         schools undergoing significant improvements or repairs from 6 to 22. The higher budget request
         also would provide funds for needed portable classrooms, roof replacements, and other repairs.

             New School                $19.2 million           $20.8 million           $38.4 million

             Repairs
             Total                     $51.4 million           $55.2 million           $102.8 million

                 The Tribes would view this proposal as a significant step forward in improving the
         quality of education for Indian students. Congressional delegations from the affected states also
         would receive the proposal warmly.

                  This proposal is especially important if you choose to propose a new school construction
         initiative on the tax side, because Tribes do not issue bonds for this purpose. Even if you choose
         to propose a school construction initiative on the spending side, this initiative would be valuable.
          In the Administration's school construction proposal last year, 2 percent of the funds were set
         aside for a direct appropriation for Tribal schools, over and above the accounts discussed here.
         This funding, however, is contingent on the passage of a school construction proposal, and in any
         event, is insufficient to meet the Tribes' needs.

               We have developed this proposal with the involvement and support ofOMB, the
         Department of the Interior and the Department of Education.

         Other Initiatives

                We are working to make sure that other education initiatives proposed for FY99 include
         an appropriate set-aside for BIA schools and, where feasible, for public schools that serve a large
         concentration of Native American students. These include:

                    Education Opportunity Zones. A percentage of grant funds will be set aside for
                     administration by the BIA, and the Education Department will be encouraged to provide
                     at least one grant to a rural school district with a large percentage of Native American



                                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

    students.

   Early Intervention College/School Partnerships. We are working to determine the best
    ways to ensure that Tribal Colleges can effectively participate in this initiative, as well as
    to fund other college/school partnerships in communities with a large percentage of
    Native American students.

   Child Care. The Child Care Block Grant already contains a set aside for administration
    by BIA. Proposed funding increases in this program will automatically benefit programs
    serving Native Americans on reservations.

   Technology. This year the BIA launched Access Native America, an initiative to
    implement the four pillars of your technology challenge and to connect all schools,
    classrooms, and libraries to the Department ofInterior's Internet backbone by the year
    2000. Within the past month, DPC arranged a meeting between BIA staff and the
    Schools and Libraries Corporation to help Tribal schools take advantage of the e-rate. As
    a result, the Corporation has agreed that BIA can apply for the e-rate on behalf of all
    Tribal schools, and BIA has begun to develop materials and plan training so that schools
    can complete the necessary applications.

   Teacher Preparation and Recruitment. This initiative, which you announced at the
    NAACP Convention on July 17, helps to prepare and recruit teachers to serve in high-
    poverty urban and rural communities. At the time this proposal was developed, we did
    not target funds to Tribal schools. We are in the process of preparing new legislative
    language to take care of that omission, and will work with our Congressional allies to
    incorporate it into our proposal.                 .
