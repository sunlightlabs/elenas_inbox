Crime Stoppers:

Attached please find a 2-pager on the YCGII, some Q/A and a list of the 10
new cities for your review.  I guess we need to get this to the press
office before the radio address tomorrow -- 7:40pm.  PLEASE NOTE: One of
the cities -- Las Vegas -- dropped out a short while ago, so we'll need to
find a replacement first thing in the a.m.  Also, Houston still needs to
be confirmed as a go.

Regards,
Sleepy

                             JULY 19,1997

BACKGROUND:

    On July 8, 1996, President Clinton directed the Attorney General and
     Secretary Rubin to implement a pilot program in 17 cities to trace as many
     guns as possible, especiaiiy those trafficked to kids.

    Under this pilot program, the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative
     (YCGII), Federal and local law enforcement in each city worked together
     to submit all crime guns seized for tracing and use this information to
     identity and locate illegal gun traffickers.

    Since then, the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
     Firearms (ATF) has provided local police departments and ATF special
     agents with specialized training, computers and software -- and traced as
     many guns as possible through the National Training Center. Today's
     report details the findings of this effort.

FINDINGS OF TODAY'S REPORT:

    Confirms kids and guns is a serious problem'in all 17 cities. Juvenile and
     youth crime guns account for nearly half (45%) of the firearms recovered
     from crime scenes and criminals.

    Reveals that kids use some of the most concealable and dangerous guns.
      While 80% of youth and juvenile crime guns are handguns -- and 60% are
     semiautomatic pistols, only 70% of adult crime guns are handguns -- and
     less than half, or 47%, are semiautomatics.

    Crime guns used by kids are concentrated among a relatively small
     number of makes and models. The 10 most popular types of crime guns
     account for 25% of all crime guns. In some cities, this percentage is as
     high as 50% for youth or juveniles (e.g., Birmingham, Memphis).

    At least 25% of the crime guns used by kids move rapidly (3 years or less)
     from first retail sale to crime scenes. That means that a significant portion
     of legally purchased guns are quickly and illegally diverted to kids and
     criminals.

    The number of trace requests nearly doubled in the 17 pilot cities. While
     not all traces submitted could be completed, for a variety of reasons,
     overall requests submitted to ATF jumped from about 20,000 to 37,000.

    The Shikes Case. Shortly after the YCGII was launched, ATF and the
     Milwaukee Police Department received a tip that an individual named
     "Larry" was selling guns to gang members. This individual was Larry Shikes,
     and he was selling guns from the trunk of his car in the parking lot of the
     grocery store where he worked as a security guard.

     A review of trace information on Milwaukee crime guns revealed that
     Shikes had originally purchased several guns that were recovered in
     cOr)nection with youth gang crimes -- including homicides, assaults and
     drive-by-shootings. Shikes illegal activity was further documented by
     undercover purchases of additional shotguns and handguns.

     Shikes was arrested in April 1997. He pled guilty to dealing in firearms
     without a license and providing fireorms to convicted felons. He is
     scheduled to be sentenced next month.

LESSONS LEARNED:

    A new anti-crime tool. By submitting g.lJ. crime guns for tracing, the YCGII is
     showing law enforcement at all levels how young people are getting
     guns. This is critical information that will allow law enforcement to prioritize
     the investigation of gun traffickers.

    Guns are being trafficked to kids. ATF traces and investigations clearly
     show that certain corrupt gun dealers are selling guns to large volume
     traffickers and straw purchasers, who are in turn funneling guns to our
     youth. With more tracing information and enforcement resources, we can
     crackdown on these traffickers and break-up the supply of guns to kids
     and criminals.

    Brady checks important. Background checks are needed to help keep
     guns from being illegally diverted. So it's critical that state and local law
     enforcement continue their commitment to Brady.

TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT:

    More Cities, More Resources. Today, the President will expand the YCGII
     to 10 more cities. The Treasury Deportment will commit $11 million to
     augment its tracing efforts next year, and the Department of Justice will
     dedicate funds from the Bureau of Justice Assistance to help provide
     training to participating state and local law enforcement agencies.
     Additional funds will also be sought for ATF agents from unobligated funds.

                           QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                                 JULY 19, 1997

 Q:    What exactly has the Administration learned from this report -- and how
       will it be used to reduce juvenile gun crime?

       First, we have learned that comprehensive, community-based tracing of
       crime guns is doable -- as well as a worthwhile endeavor. The voluntary
       commitment of each of these cities to submit as many crime guns as
       possible for tracing resulted in a near doubling in the overall number of
       trace requests -- from about 20,000 to 37,000. In New York, for example,
       trace requests jumped from 4,000 to 13,000; in San Antonio, trace requests
       increased from a mere 500 to about 2,000.

       Second, we have learned that SUbstantial number of guns -- nearly half of
       those recovered from crime scenes or criminals-- are being trafficked to
       our kids in a variety of ways and shortly after they were legally purchased.
        We have learned that kids are more likely than adults to commit a crime
       with a new handgun -- especially with certain types of semiautomatic
       pistol. And we have learned that most crime guns generally originate
       from in-state sources.

       And thirdly, each of the communities involved -- and Federal law
       enforcement -- have learned more about the make-up and trafficking
       patterns of crime guns in their area. These community specific reports are
       a valuable enforcement tool that can be used to crackdown on local
       traffickers and break-up the supply of guns to our kids. This is how Boston
       has used its trace information, and -- as I understand it -- last week they
       celebrated their second anniversary of no juvenile gun homicides.

 Q:    Can you please clarify today's announcement?

. A:   Based on our experience with the first 17 cities, we are going to expand
       the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) to an additional 10
       cities. There was considerable interest from other cities when we initiated
       the pilot program last year, so we are pleased to expand the YCGII today.
        A copy of these cities should be in your press packet.

       To pay for this -- and to increase ATF's overall ability to do more traces and
       trace analysis -- Treasury will dedicate about $11 million from its forfeiture
       fund next year. That's about 10 times what we've spent during this first
       year, so that's a significant enhancement.

                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
     some funds to help train participating state and local law enforcement
     agencies.

Q:   How where both the new cities for this initiative picked?

A:   As I understand it, most of the cities were selected based on the number
     of firearms and violent offenses committed by youths and juveniles.
     However, several of the cities were picked because, unlike the national
     crime trend, they have been experiencing increases in violent crime over
     the past few years.

Q:   If tracing and trace analysis lead to cracking down on gun traffickers, how
     many have you prosecuted as a result of this effort?

A:   Well, first let me make clear that we are only one-year into this initiative,
     and that establishing the tracing infrastructure (i.e., trained officers,
     computers, software, etc.) and producing the national and local reports
     was our initial goal.

     Also, the YCGII is a special component of ATF's overall firearms trafficking
     strategy that has generated thousands of investigations over the past year
     -- involving tens of thousands of illegally trafficked firearms. And over time,
     we expect the YCGII to contribute many important cases to this workload.

     Having said that, to date, ATF estimates that the YCGII has helped initiate
     some 75 pending trafficking investigations.

Q:   How come ATF only traced an average of 37% of the guns submitted to
     the National Tracing Center?

A:   There are several reasons why complete traces were not conducted for
     all crime guns. In some cases, because of different tracing guidelines and
     practices, not all of the required information was submitted. In other
     cases, firearms were either too old or serial numbers obliterated. While
     traces can be completed in these instances, they are much more
     resource intensive. Many of these issues can now be addressed.

     It is important to note, however, that not all trace analyses depend on a
     successfully completing trace requests.

marked with an asterisk (*) were chosen because, unlike the
national trend, they have experienced increases in violent crime.
