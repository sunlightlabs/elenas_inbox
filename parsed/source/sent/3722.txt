      Nothing that Mr. Fitzsimmons now says contradicts or undermines the President's
       position, which is that so-called partial-birth abortions should be banned except when
       they are necessary to save the life of a woman or prevent serious harm to her health.

      The President has never claimed that partial-birth abortions are used only, or even
       primarily, to prevent death or serious harm. What he has said is that when (but only
       when) the procedure is necessary for these reasons, a doctor must be allowed to perform
       it.

      The President has recognized that some doctors may use the procedure for elective
       reasons and has called for an end to this practice. He has stated on several occasions:
       "The procedure may well be used in situations where a woman's serious health interests
       are not at issue. But I do not support such uses, I do not defend them, and I would sign
       appropriate legislation banning them."

      The President's position today remains what it has always been: that he will sign a bill
       banning partial-birth abortions, but only if it has an exception that will protect those
       women -- even if few in number -- who need this procedure to save their lives or prevent
       serious harm to their health.


Background

Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, said
this week that partial birth abortions are (1) performed more frequently than pro-choice groups
have acknowledged and (2) often performed on healthy women with healthy fetuses.

There are no good statistics on these questions, and it would be a great mistake to challenge
Fitzsimmons on the facts. The important point is that even if true, Fitzsimmons's claims do not
undermine the President's position, as explained above.
