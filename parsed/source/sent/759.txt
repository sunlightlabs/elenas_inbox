MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                   BRUCE REED
                        ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:                WELFARE REFORM -- PRIVATIZATION AND MINIMUM WAGE

        We must soon provide guidance on two welfare reform issues of importance both to
States and labor unions: (1) whether states can privatize certain administrative functions of the
Food Stamp and Medicaid programs and (2) whether worker protection laws -- particularly the
minimum wage (Fair Labor Standards Act) -- apply to work programs under the new welfare law.
 This memorandum outlines recommended approaches to dealing with these issues. The
recommendation on privatization will give states part of what they want while angering unions;
the recommendation on worker protection laws will please the unions while angering states.

Privatizing Food Stamp and Medicaid Administration

       The new welfare law explicitly allows states to contract with private entities to
administer Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). The Administration now
must decide how to respond to two requests to privatize administration of other federally
funded benefit programs. Texas wants to contract out, on a statewide basis, administration
of both the Food Stamps and Medicaid programs; Wisconsin wants to privatize
administration of the Food Stamps program in a number of counties, though the need for
an administrative decision on this plan is not as pressing. Federal approval of these
requests will establish a policy for other states as well.

         States that want to privatize believe that a competitive contracting process will
result in greater program efficiencies while adequately protecting program recipients.
(Because Medicaid and Food Stamps remain federal entitlements, private contractors
determining eligibility for the programs would have to follow federal eligibility rules.)
Organized labor is concerned that privatizing government functions will displace state and
local government workers (with a resulting loss of union membership). They also charge
that privatization will harm recipients because contractors will "cut comers" in determining
eligibility for benefits.

       All the relevant agencies and White House offices (HHS, USDA, OMB, DPC, and
NEC) believe that allowing some privatization makes sense: the question is how much.
Below, after some additional background information, we outline a consensus
recommendation.
                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

        Federal agencies and the state of Texas have been negotiating since June 1996 over
the state's proposal to privatize the administration of T ANF, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and
certain other federally-funded nutrition programs. The state legislature passed the plan
with bipartisan support, with endorsements from Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and other leading
Democrats. Under the Texas plan, private contractors would collect information about
applicants (including by conducting interviews) and make eligibility determinations. The
State would retain control over the appeals and quality control processes. An estimated
15,000 state jobs would be eliminated or transferred to the private sector. The state would
require bidders to comment on whether they plan to hire displaced government workers.
Such companies as Lockheed, EDS, and Arthur Anderson have indicated an interest in
bidding.

       Texas has argued that it cannot proceed with plans to contract out TANF (as
allowed by the welfare law) unless the Administration allows private contracting for Food
Stamps and Medicaid, because maintaining separate eligibility systems for these programs
creates administrative difficulties. To take the most obvious problem, a dual system would
require many individuals to go to one location to apply for T ANF and another location to
apply for Food Stamps and Medicaid. Texas wants a one-stop eligibility center.

         Texas state officials are becoming increasingly impatient with UUS and USDA for
not having ruled on their proposal. In a recent letter to nus, state officials threatened to
proceed with the project without Federal approval. State officials also point out that they
have pledged to reinvest the savings from their plan in additional health and human
services programs, and that these savings could provide health coverage for 150,000 Texas
children. Rep. Charlie Stenholm, one of the Administration's strongest welfare reform
allies, complained about the delay to Frank Raines in a February 24th letter, saying the
state of Texas is "willing to make accommodations to address administration concerns."
Secretary Shalala has promised Texas an answer by early April. Most recently, we heard
from Rep. Stenholm's office and from Gary Mauro that Texas would accept modifications
of its proposal as long as we allow the State to go forward with releasing a "request for
offers" ("RFO") to potential bidders.

       Labor leaders would like us to refuse the Texas request entirely. They see even
limited privatization as a dangerous precedent and have made clear that they view this
decision as critically important to public employee unions.

Recommendation

        All the relevant agencies and White House offices agree that the Administration should
draw the line on the basis of our existing Medicaid policy, which allows privatization of some
but not all administrative functions. Under this approach, the application, interview, and other
information-gathering can be done by private employees; the eligibility determination itself, as
well as appeals and quality control, must remain in the hands of public employees. In addition,
the Administration should ensure that contracts protect against the possibility that private firms
                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dwnp Conversion

will use procedures that lead to inappropriate denials -- or, as OMB notes, inappropriate grants --
of program benefits.

        This general approach has both strong precedent and good sense behind it. The Medicaid
program already allows private hospital workers to do intake and eligibility work, up to the point
of actually determining eligibility. Allowing privatization of these functions, conditioned on
appropriate contract incentives and safeguards, strikes the right balance between allowing states
to explore innovative ways to deliver public services and ensuring that beneficiaries' rights are
protected. There is little doubt that this approach will displace some state workers and displease
public employee unions. But we have crossed this bridge already in Medicaid and other
contexts; for example, the Department of Labor has granted a waiver to Massachusetts to
contract out all employment services and is prepared to do the same for other states as well.

        In line with this view, we recommend that we inform Texas of the principles we will
apply in reviewing any privatization scheme and give formal permission to the State to issue its
RFO. Once the State accepts a bid, we will review whether the contract appropriately accords
with our principles. This approach gives Texas less than it asked for, but allows the State to
proceed with some reforms. It preserves a role for public employees, but will still anger the
UnIons.

II. Application of Labor Laws

        As states begin to redesign their work programs to meet the work participation
rates in the new welfare law, a critical question for both the labor movement and the states
is whether worker protection laws --particularly the minimum wage law (Fair Labor
Standards Act) -- protect welfare recipients who take part in workfare or subsidized
employment programs. The answer the Administration is ready to announce on this issue -
- that as a matter of law, worker protections apply to welfare recipients as they do to other
employees -- will mostly please the unions and displease the States.

Recommended Administration Position

       A review conducted by the White House and relevant agencies has concluded that
current law requires applying the minimum wage law and other worker protections to
welfare recipients engaged in work activities. The new welfare law contains no exemptions
from worker protection statutes for these individuals, leaving these protective statutes to
operate as they would for any other worker. States therefore cannot, as they partly could
before, set up and run work programs independent of labor laws. (The Family Support
Act exempted workfare programs from the FLSA, but required work hours to be based on
the minimum wage.)

       The FLSA, when applied to people in workfare and wage supplementation
programs, usually will require payment of the minimum wage. As long as participants in
such programs count as "employees" under the Act, they will qualify for the minimum
wage. A State could try to structure its program so that participants will count instead as
"trainees" under the Act, because "trainees" are not entitled to the minimum wage. It will
                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

be extremely difficult, however, for states to construct programs in which participants will
count as "trainees" under the FLSA and also count as performing work activities (and
therefore counting toward work participation rates) under the new welfare law. As a
result, application of the FLSA will usually mean that the State must pay the minimum
wage to individuals in workfare programs.
        The food stamp law gives states the ability to count food ·stamps as part of the
minimum wage for some individuals engaged in workfare programs. Specifically, the state
can count food stamps toward the minimum wage for welfare recipients without a child
under the age of six, but not for welfare recipients with such a child. (We are checking now
whether there is a legal way to allow states to count food stamps toward the minimum wage
in all cases, but suspect we will not find any.) The state will be able to count the value of
other benefits (child care, housing, or transportation) toward the minimum wage only
when the FLSA allows the counting of such benefits for workers generally -- which is only
in unusual circumstances.

       In addition to the minimum wage law, the Occupational Safety and Health Act,
unemployment insurance laws, and anti-discrimination laws usually will protect welfare
workers; in addition, the NLRA usually will give them organizing rights. More uncertain
is how the tax code will apply to individuals in workfare and wage supplementation
programs. The Treasury Depar:tment is still considering whether monies paid to welfare
recipients will be subject to FICA and other taxes or would qualify for the EITC. Our
1994 and 1996 welfare bills prohibited recipients from receiving the EITC or being subject
to FICA.

Anticipated State and Congressional Response

        We should expect the announcement of Administration policy to provoke strong
criticism from the states and Congress. On March 3rd, Governor Whitman wrote in a
letter to you that applying minimum wage laws to workfare participants would "end
welfare reform as we know it" by placing states in the position of either failing to meet the
law's work requirements or incurring large new costs. Even The New York Times
editorial board, in discussing union plans to organize workfare participants, has opined
that "what they are doing does not amount to a job" -- a view consistent with what many
States and members of Congress will be saying.

        The reason states will protest is obvious: applying minimum wage laws will increase
the cost of running workfare programs. (Of course, requiring the minimum wage will not
make it more expensive for states to help welfare recipients find unsubsidized private
sector jobs or to subsidize private sector jobs.) In 36 states, the current cash welfare
benefit for a family of three will fall short of a minimum wage salary even for a 20-hour
work week. As the work requirement in the law increases to 25 and then to 30 hours, and
as the minimum wage also increases, 48 states (all but Hawaii and Alaska) will discover
that their welfare grants are insufficient. (See attached document.)

       Counting the value of food stamps will ease this difficulty, to the extent that states

                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                                                    5

    can do so. (As noted above, states may not be able to count food stamps for individuals
    with children under six.) But even if both T ANF and food stamp benefits are counted
    toward the minimum wage, Mississippi wili immediately come up short. As the minimum
    wage increases and the work requirements increase to 30 hours, a total of twenty states will
    find themselves in this position.

           This policy is a mixed blessing for recipients. The increased expense of public
    employment will encourage state efforts to find private sector jobs for welfare recipients --
    a policy we believe is desirable. But that same expense also may encourage states to cut
    recipients from the welfare rolls sooner, rather than place them in public sector jobs.

           There is little doubt that once we announce our reading of the law~ efforts will begin '
    in Congress to exempt workfare programs from worker protection laws entirely or to enact
    more limited "fixes." We will have to track these efforts carefully and decide, as we gain
    more information, how to respond to them.

                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
