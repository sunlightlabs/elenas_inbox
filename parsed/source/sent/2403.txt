                             Education Working Group: Thinking Paper

        Realizing the President's vision of One America will require a long-term effort to achieve the
following goals in several critical areas, including education, economic development, and criminal justice:

               Overcome racial disparities;
               Eliminate racial discrimination;
               Improve race relations and promote the value of our diversity.

As part of the President's workplan to achieve these goals, we must construct an agenda of short- and long-
term policy actions to be implemented by the federal government, state, local, and tribal governments, the
private sector, the non-profit sector, and others. In terms of education, while we must promote action in
both K-12 and higher education, given the growing importance of lifelong learning in the 21st century, we
should think of education as a continuous pipeline from birth through college and beyond.

        To develop a workplan to achieve the above goals in education, we must develop answers to the
following questions (NOTE: None of the answers that follow the questions listed below are meant to be
complete; rather, they are initial ideas.):

I.      What are the key challenges (i.e., disparities, discrimination, race relations) of race in
        education? (NOTE: We need to think here of what concrete goals we must accomplish in
        the next X years.)

        I.      Racial disparities in early childhood development (including prenatal care, family
                learning, child care, pre-kindergarten).
       2.       Racial disparities in access to educational resources (including funding, high quality
                teachers, academic materials, challenging curricula, modem technology, contemporary
                facilities, college participation).
       3.       Increasing number and diversity ofLEP students.
       4.       Racial disparities/discrimination in educational expectations (including access to high
                standards, beliefs about individual capacity, beliefs about whose world is whose, beliefs
                about the "coolness" of educational success, and understanding of opportunities).
       5.       Racial disparities in educational achievement (including test scores, high school
                graduation rates, college graduation rates).
       6.       State of segregation in education (including segregation among schools, segregation
                within diverse schools due to tracking and self-segregation, lack of diversity in higher
                education).
       7.       Vestiges of discrimination in access to K-12lhigher education.

II.    What are the hard questions that we must answer to address those challenges?

       1.      What is the appropriate role of the federal government in K-12 education?
       2.      What is the proper role of public versus private versus parochial schools? OR What is the
                proper role of vouchers?
       3.      How do we best educate LEP students? OR What is the proper role of bilingual
               education? How do we best accommodate language diversity?
       4.      What is the value of diversity in K-12lhigher education?


                                                    1
                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

       5.     What is the proper role of affinnative action in higher education? OR Under what
              circumstances are race-based actions required or permitted?

III.   What has the Administration accomplished/proposed thus far to address those challenges?

       1.     Administration Accomplishments: AmeriCorps; America.Reads; Technology Literacy
              Challenge Fund; increased support for Head Start; support for Charter Schools; Goals
              2000 and promotion of high standards; promotion of partnerships between schools and
              families; Safe and Drug Free Schools Act and Safe Schools Act; support for bilingual
              education; increased support for Title I; increased loans, grants (e.g., Pell Grants), and
              work study to make college more affordable and to make two years of college universal;
              School to Work.
       2.     Prior Administration Proposals:
       3.     Recent Administration Proposals: Recruiting New Teachers; Small Class Sizes in Early
              Grades; Modem School Buildings; Education Opportunity Zones; Hispanic Action Plan;
              High Hopes; increased support for students loans, grants, and work study; support for
              affinnative action, increased support for after-school programs.

IV.    What are some bold ideas (new or reformulated) to address those challenges? (NOTE:
       These bold ideas should include federal and non-federal actions, short- and long-term
       actions, etc.)

             Advisory Board's Likely Recommendations: Strengthen teacher preparation and equity;
              promote school construction; enhance early childhood learning; promote high
              expectations; promote movement from K-12 to higher education; promote the benefits of
              diversity in K-12 and higher education.

       I.     Improve Teacher Education:
       2.     Set Opportunity to Learn Standards:
       3.     Equalize School Funding:
       4.     Promote School Construction:
       5.     Support Test Preparation Programs:

                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
