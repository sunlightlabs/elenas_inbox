                             Speech to American Federation of Teachers
                                       Questions and Answers
                                           July 20, 1998

    School Discipline

    Q.     Do you know how many schools have school uniform policies in place?

    A,    While we do not have comprehensive data on the number of schools that have adopted
          uniform policies, we know that there has been a recent push by schools and school
          districts nationwide to adopt school uniform policies to improve student discipline,
          attendance, and school climate, Since President Clinton called on the Education
          Department to send out a guide on school uniform policies to every school district in the
          country in 1996, a growing number of schools and school districts have adopted uniform
          policies:

                 The Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics estimates
                  that of the 3% of all public schools that have mandatory uniform policies, 34%
                  initiated their policies in the 1996-97 school year.

                 The 1998 National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) survey
                  of principals in 10 states shows that 11 % of elementary schools require uniforms,
                  and 15% are considering a policy. Almost two-thirds of schools with policies
                  adopted them in the last two years.

          Moreover, some of the nation's largest school districts have adopted school uniform
          policies, including: New York City, Dade County, San Antonio, Houston, Chicago, and
          Boston. In New York City alone, this will mean that 560,000 elementary school students
          in the nation's largest school system will have school uniforms by the fall of 1999.


    Q.    How do you know if school uniforms are having an impact on school crime?

    A.    School uniforms have been identified as a promising strategy to help make students safer
          while promoting discipline and respect in schools. Because the policy is recent, there are
          few large-scale research studies on the effectiveness of school uniforms. Perhaps the best
          and most publicized study comes from the Long Beach, CA School District -- the first
          large school district to require uniforms in all elementary and middle schools. Total
          crime -- including assault, fighting, robbery, and vandalism -- fell 76 percent between
          1993 (when the school uniform policy began) and 1997. More specifically, weapons
          offenses dropped 83 percent and vandalism was cut in half. In addition, in the 1995-96
          school year, attendance hit an all-time high (94.7%). While the district does not attribute
          these impressive results solely to its school uniform policy, it believes that this policy has
          contributed to safer, better schools.

                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

A.    Last December, the U.S. Conference of Mayors released a 347-city survey of youth
      curfews. In the survey, 93 percent of cities reported that enforcing a curfew is a useful
      tool for police; more specifically, cities reported that curfews were a proactive way to
      combat youth violence as well as prevent juveniles from becoming crime victims. Eighty
      eight percent of cities reported that curfews help to curb gang violence. All of the 72
      cities that had a daytime curfew reported that it cut down on truancy.

      In May 1996, the Justice Department released a report by the Office of Juvenile Justice
      and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) on 7 jurisdictions with youth curfews in place. The
      report showed that curfews can play an important role in keeping our children safe,
      especially when they are part of a larger plan to fight juvenile violence. For instance, in .
      New Orleans, a community-supported curfew -- combined with summer jobs and
      recreational programs for youth -- helped cut juvenile crime during curfew hours the year
      after it was implemented.


Q.    Wasn't a study released earlier this year showing that curfews don't reduce crime?

A.    In June, the Justice Policy Institute released a study on curfews in California. The study,
      which argues that curfew enforcement has not reduced youth crime in the state, has been
      criticized by California law enforcement officials, including the State Attorney General's
      office. Law enforcement officials across the State have stated that they have seen a very
      positive correlation between curfews, truancy laws, and lower crime rates.

      President Clinton believes that tools such as curfews, school uniforms, and anti-truancy
      policies can help schools and communities enhance youth discipline and reduce crime as
      part of a comprehensive plan to combat juvenile violence and crime.


White House Conference on School Safety

Q.    What can you tell us about the White House conference on school safety?

A.    In his speech today, the President will announce a White House Conference on School
      Safety to be held on October 15, 1998, which he will proclaim National School Safety
      Day. The White House Conference will be linked by satellite to schools across the
      country, including the communities impacted by the recent wave of school shootings. We
      are still in the planning stages and will make details known as they are available.

                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

Q.     What are you doing about all of these school shootings?

A.    This spring, the President sat down with youth violence experts -- from principals to
      parents to prosecutors -- to discuss what we can do at all levels to keep these tragedies
      from occurring. There was broad agreement that we should focus on tackling the larger
      problem of youth violence. That is why the President continues to challenge Congress to
      pass his strategy on youth violence, including preventing youth from gainaing access to
      guns, imposing tough punishments on violent youths and gangs, and providing after
      school programs during the hours when violent juvenile crime is most likely to occur.

      Today's announcement of a White House Conference on School Safety will be an
      important step to focus on making schools safer for our kids. The President has already
      taken a number of actions to address the troubling series of school shootings, including:

      Early warning guide. Last month, the President directed the Secretary of Education and
      the Attorney General to develop a guide to help teachers and principals identify and
      respond to the early warning signs of troubled youth that can lead to school violence. The
      guide will be made available to schools nationwide when classes begin in the fall.

      First Annual Report on School Safety. In December, the President called for the
      development of an Annual Report on School Safety, which will be released on School
      Safety Day, October 15. The report will include: an analysis of all existing national
      school crime data and an overview of state and local school crime data; examples of
      schools and strategies that are successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and class
      disruption; actions that parents can take locally to combat school crime, including a local
      safety checklist; and resources available to schools and communities to help create safe,
      disciplined, and drug-free schools.

      More Police in Schools. In March, the President announced funding for a new
      community policing program through the Justice Department's COPS Office focused on
      reducing violence on or near school grounds. The President later called on the Attorney
      General and Education Secretary to report back by the start of the school year on ways to
      provide even more police for our schools.

      Promoting Gun Safety and Responsibility. Earlier this month, President Clinton called
      on states to promote gun safety and responsibility by passing Child Access Prevention
      (CAP) laws that hold adults responsible if they allow children easy access to loaded
      firearms. Fifteen states have already enacted such CAP laws. A recent study published by
      the Journal of the American Medical Association found that CAP laws reduced fatal
      unintentional shootings by an average of 23 percent.

Teacher Issues



                                                   Automated Records Management System

       leading the state board of education to consider lowering the score required to pass.
        Should all teachers be required to pass such a test? What does this say about the
       quality of our teaching force?

A.     The President believes that new teachers should pass tests of basic skills and subject
       matter knowledge before they can teach. His proposal to reduce class size would require
       new teachers hired under this program to pass a competency test.

       The high failure rate in Massachusetts underscores the need for every state to put in place
       teacher testing requirements, so that individuals who lack the basic skills don't become
       teachers. It also underscores the need for colleges and universities to improve teacher
       education programs, because no college graduate should fail such a test. Moreover, we
       clearly need to attract the most talented people into teaching. this involves making
       teaching a respected, appealing profession to enter, providing training and mentoring for
       new teachers, and enacting initiatives like the President's proposal -- recently approved by
       the Senate as part of the Higher Education Act -- to give financial incentives to talented
       new teachers who commit to teach in high-need schools.


Q.     Many believe that teachers' unions are the biggest obstacles to needed reforms in
       public education. Why didn't the President take on the unions to ask them to get
       behind real reform?

A.     President Clinton has never hesitated to take on any interests that were roadblocks to real
       education reform -- including the Arkansas Education Association, which resisted Gov.
       Clinton's plan for teacher testing. The reforms that are most important for strengthening
       public education -- national standards and tests in the basic skills, higher standards for
       teachers, smaller classes and modernized school buildings, expanded after-school
       programs, public schQol choice and charter schools -- are supported by the AFT and the
       NEA. Right now, the Congress is the obsta<;le to taking these steps, not the teachers.


Q.     What is the President's view of the failed merger effort between the NEA and the
       AFT?

A.     The President has no view on whether the NEA and AFT should merge. That issue is up
       to the members in both organizations. Either way, what is important is that teachers take
       responsibility, inside and outside the classroom, for strengthening public schools and
       helping our students reach the highest standards.


Q. .   What does the President think about proposals to end teacher tenure and other
       ways to make sure that bad teachers don't keep on teaching?



                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
     incompetent teachers from the classroom. He also supports efforts to reward outstanding
      teachers, such as master teachers who pass rigorous tests offered by the National Board
     for Professional Teaching Standards.


Q.   If the President supports tests for new teachers, and as Governor he supported tests
     for current teachers, why isn't he now proposing tests for current teachers?

A.   The President believes we need to take the most essential steps first. With two million
     teachers to be hired in the next ten years, we have an enormous opportunity to affect the
     quality of the teaching force for decades -- if we set the standards high for entering the
     profession. Meanwhile, he has called for rewarding good teachers that meet the
     demanding standards set by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and
     for using fair but fast ways of removing incompetent teachers.


Q.   Does the President support Sandra Feldman's call Friday for ending emergency
     licensure and ending the practice of assigning teachers to subject areas for which
     they are not certified?

A.   Yes. These are important steps to ensuring quality teaching in our classrooms.
     Emergency certificates are teaching licenses given to people who may not meet any
     requirements for teaching, including a B.A. Most often, people with these emergency
     certificates teach in high poverty schools, where students are most in need of well
     prepared teachers. The President believes we should raise standards for teachers, not
     evade them. He thinks that all new teachers should meet state certification requirements,
     including teacher competency testing, which is now required by more than 40 states. He
     also supports "alternate route" approaches, which allow talented individuals to become
     certified without enrolling in conventional teacher preparation programs. And he
     believes that teachers should not be teaching subjects in which they lack adequate
     academic preparation.

                                      July 18, 1998

In his speech to the AFT today, the President will discuss the importance of school discipline and
safety to the nation. He will announce a White House Conference on School Safety and
highlight some of the school safety policies promoted by the Administration -- school uniforms,
tough truancy laws, community-based curfews, and zero tolerance for guns.

White House COllferellce 011 School Safety

      National School Safety Day. The President will announce that he will chair a White
       House Conference on School Safety on October 15, 1998, which he will proclaim
       National School Safety Day. The Conference will be linked by satellite to schools across
       the country, including each of the communities affected by the recent wave of school
       shootings.

      First Annual Report on School Safety. At the Conference, the President will issue the
       first Annual Report on School Safety, which will include: an analysis of all existing
       national school crime data and an overview of state and local school crime data; examples
       of schools and strategies that are successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and
       class disruption; actions that parents can take locally to combat school crime, including a
       local safety checklist; and resources available to schools and communifies to help create
       safe, disciplined, and drug-free schools.

Promotillg School Disciplille

      Spreading school uniform policies across the country. Since President Clinton
       highlighted school uniform policies in 1996, a growing number of schools have decided
       to require school uniforms. Among the schools to have adopted uniform policies are
       schools in some of the nation's largest school districts -- New York City, Dade County,
       San Antonio, Houston, Chicago, and Boston. In New York City alone, more than half a
       million elementary school students will be wearing uniforms by the fall of 1999.

       Recent data from Long Beach, California suggest that these policies work. In the 1995-
       96 school year -- the third year school unifonns were required -- attendance at the Long
       Beach Unified School District K-8 schools reached the highest point ever recorded during
       the 17 years the district compiled these statistics. With excused absences for illness
       added in, attendance exceeded 99 percent. And between the 1993-94 school year (before
       uniforms were required) and the 1996-97 school year, total school crime dropped 76
       percent.

      Keeping kids off the street and in school. Community curfews, which the President
       also has highlighted, are designed to help keep children out ofhann's way, enhance
       community safety, and give parents an important tool to impart discipline, respect, and

      Taking on truancy. In 1996, at the President's direction, the Education Department
       issued a guidebook to the 15,000 school districts across the nation, outlining the core
       components of a comprehensive truancy prevention policy and highlighting model
       initiatives. Since then, the Department has provided grants to local school districts to
       develop innovative truancy prevention programs of the kind described in its guidebook.

      Enforcing zero tolerance for guns in schools. In October 1994, President Clinton signed
       into law the Gun-Free Schools Act and issued a Presidential Directive to enforce "zero
       tolerance" for guns in schools -- if a student brings a gun to school, that student will be
       expelled for a year. The Department of Education estimates that under this zero tolerance
       policy, 6,093 students were expelled from public schools for bringing a firearm to school
       during the 1996-97 school year.

Challenging Congress to Strengthen Public Schools

President Clinton will call on Congress again to support his efforts to improve and reform
K-12 education. He will urge Congress to enact his proposals to reduce class size,
modernize our schools, invest in technology, expand after-school learning opportunities,
raise standards, and end social promotions. He also will advocate giving competency tests
to teachers and refusing to hire or license individuals who fail those tests.
