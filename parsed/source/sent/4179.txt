               FACT SHEET: PRESIDENT CLINTON'S LINE ITEM VETO OF PROJECTS IN THE
                      FY 1998 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT
                                         OCTOBER 6,1997


                  38 Projects Cancelled. Today, President Clinton announced that he will line item veto
                   38 projects in the Military Construction Appropriations Act of 1998 using the authority
                   given him in the Line Item Veto Act.

                  Saving Taxpayers Nearly $290 Million. The President's action will reduce budget
                   authority by $287 million in fiscal 1998.

                  Bill Included 145 Projects Not Requested by the President. The Military Construction
                   Act included funding for 145 projects that were not requested by the President in his 1998
                   Budget.

                          -- The Administration has carefully reviewed those unrequested projects and has
                          concluded that while a majority of them have merit, a number of them do not.

                  The President Is Using His Authority to Veto Projects that Meet All of the Following
                   Three Criteria:

                          (1)     The project was not requested in the President's FY 1998 Budget;
                          (2)     The project would not substantially improve the quality oflife of military
                                  service members and their families; and
                          (3)     The project is unlikely to begin construction in FY 98 since the
                                  Department of Defense reports that no design work has been done on it.

                  The President's Action Will Do Nothing to Undercut Our National Security, The
                   Readiness of our Forces or their Operations in Defense of our Nation.

                         Based on these criteria, the President left over 400 projects in the Military
                          Construction Appropriations Act, including 107 added by the Congress, reflecting
                          his commitment to the quality of life of the forces and their families and his
                          understanding of Congress' role in shaping appropriations bills. In fact, the
                          President's actions accept a net of over $500 million in military construction
                          funding he did not request.

                  Under the Line Item Veto Act, which was signed into law on April 9, 1996, the President
                   is authorized to cancel tax and spending items ifhe determines that ~ancellation will:

                          -- reduce the Federal budget deficit,
                          -- not impair any essential government functions, and
                          -- not harm the national interest.

                  In addition, the Act requires the President to transmit to Congress a "special message"
                   explaining his decision to cancel any tax or spending item pursuant to the Act.



                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
