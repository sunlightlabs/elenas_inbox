                               to Protect America's Children


        Today, President Clinton challenged Congress to pass sweeping tobacco legislation to
reduce teen tobacco use significantly. The President announced that he will invite Congressional
leaders in both parties to the White House in the coming weeks to launch a bipartisan effort to
enact federal tobacco legislation. That legislation will build on the extraordinary efforts of the
nation's attorneys general, who helped create an historic opportunity for progress in reducing
smoking, especially by youth.

        In August 1996, the Clinton Administration announced a landmark rule by the Food and
Drug Administration to protect children from the hann caused by tobacco products, which was
upheld by a federal judge in North Carolina earlier this year. Those victories for the public
health, along with the aggressive efforts of the attorneys general and leaders of the public health
community, drove the tobacco companies to the bargaining table and extracted concessions that
would have been unimaginable just a short time ago.

        Since a proposed national settlement was announced June 20, the Administration -- led by
Vice President Gore, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, and Domestic
Policy Advisor Bruce Reed -- has been working with the public health community, the attorneys
general, members of Congress, tobacco fanners, and others to develop a comprehensive tobacco
policy.

       Today, the President announced five key elements that must be at the heart of any
national tobacco legislation:

       1. A Comprehensive Plan to Reduce Teen Smoking, Including Tough Penalties If
Targets Are Not Met. Every day, 3,000 young people start smoking regularly, and 1,000 of
them will die early as a result. The central goal of tobacco legislation must be a comprehensive,
nationwide effort to reduce teen smoking. The Administration is calling for:

              Tough Penalties and Price Increases to Reduce Teen Smoking: The
               Administration believes tobacco legislation must include stiff penalties that give
               the tobacco industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting kids.
               Legislation should set ambitious targets to cut teen smoking by 30% in 5 years,
               50% in 7 years, and 60% in 10 years, and impose severe financial penalties that
               hold tobacco companies accountable to meet those targets. The Administration
               supports penalties that are non-deductible, uncapped, and escalating -- so that the
               penalties get stiffer and the price goes up the more that companies miss the
               targets. Reducing youth smoking is the Administration's bottom line, and now it
               must be the industry'S bottom line.



                                                 I
                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
               cigarettes. By some estimates, a 10% increase in cigarette prices will lead to a 7%
               drop in youth smoking. Today, the President called for a combination of
               industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to
               $1.50 a pack over the next decade as riecessary to meet the youth smoking
               reduction targets.

              A Public Education and Counter Advertising Campaign: To succeed in
               reducing youth smoking, legislation must provide for a nationwide effort to
               deglamorize tobacco, warn young people of its addictive nature and deadly
               consequences, and help parents discourage their children from taking up the habit.
                Legislation should provide for a public education and counter advertising
               campaign, as well as state and local prevention efforts. The Administration also
               supports stronger, more visible warning labels on tobacco products.

              Expanded Efforts to Restrict Access and Limit Appeal: The current FDA rule
               includes significant measures to redu~e youth access to tobacco products (such as
               requiring retailers to check photo identification of anyone under 27) and to limit
               the appeal of tobacco to young people (such as restricting advertising near school
               buildings). The Administration supports legislation codifying these measures,
               imposing even stronger restrictions on youth access and appeal consistent with the
               Constitution, and establishing an effective retail licensing scheme with tough
               penalties.


        2. Full Authority for FDA to Regulate Tobacco Products. In 1996, the
Administration took the historic step of asserting FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products. Since
that time, the Administration has said it would support federal legislation explicitly affirming the
FDA's authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. Under'
such legislation, the FDA's authority over tobacco products must be as effective as its authority
over other drugs and devices, and must be sufficiently flexible to meet changing circumstances.
The legislation should not impose any obligation on the FDA to make specific findings about
such speculative matters as the creation of contraband markets; nor should it impose any special
procedural hurdles or requirements, such as enhanced standards of proof or unusual evidentiary
formalities.


        3. Changes in the Way the Tobacco Industry Does Business. Federal tobacco
legislation must include measures to expose the industry's past misconduct, especially its efforts
to market products to children, and to change the way the industry does business.

              No Marketing to Children: Commitments by the industry -- such as agreements
               to limit advertising to children -- can serve to recognize the need for increased


                                                 2

                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
               industry to stop marketing and promoting tobacco to children.

              Document Disclosure: To ensure that patterns of corporate malfeasance are
               disclosed and effectively checked in the future, tobacco legislation must provide
               for broad disclosure of industry documents, especially those containing scientific
               or other health information or relating to the industry's attempts to market tobacco
               to children. This legislation should respect essential principles of attorney-client
               privilege. But the legislation should establish effective mechanisms to tum over
               to the public all non-privileged documents, including documents the industry has
               inappropriately claimed to be privileged, as well as to disclose scientific and
               health-related information in even privileged documents.

              Corporate Compliance: Tobacco companies should set up comprehensive
               corporate compliance programs that will reinforce the real economic incentives
               provided by the youth smoking penalties to discourage companies from marketing
               to children. The legislation should establish oversight mechanisms to investigate
               and monitor corporate compliance and to make recommendations to Congress on
               appropriate future legislation.


        4. Progress Toward Other Public Health Goals. Federal tobacco legislation provides
an opportunity not only to reduce youth smoking, but to meet other public health goals: the
reduction of environmental (second-hand) tobacco smoke, the expansion of smoking cessation
programs, the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco, and the provision of funds
for health research and other health objectives.

              Second-Hand Smoke: The best scientific studies show that restrictions on
               second-hand smoke reduce the risk of death and injury to non-smokers, including
               the hundreds of thousands of children with asthma and other respiratory illness,
               and lead many smokers to quit the habit. Federal tobacco legislation should
               include provisions to restrict smoking in workplaces and other public facilities of
               the kind found in H.R. 3434, as well as in the President's recent Executive Order
               on tobacco smoke in federal facilities.

              Smoking Cessation Programs: . Data suggests that some 70% of smokers want to
               quit, but fewer than 3% each year successfully do so. Legislation should help
               enable smoking cessation services to reach and assist the millions of smokers who
               want to break their addiction to tobacco products.

              International Leadership: According to the World Health Organization
               (WHO), tobacco use now causes 3 million deaths a year worldwide; unless
               checked, that number will rise to 10 million by 2025, with 70% of annual deaths

                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion




                           occurring in developing countries. Legislation should strengthen global and
                           bilateral efforts to reduce smoking by providing assistance to international
                           institutions.

                          Resources for Health Research and Other Health Care Objectives: The
                           Administration believes that the primary objective of tobacco legislation is to
                           reduce youth smoking, not to raise money. But tobacco legislation also should
                           take into account the health costs associated with smoking and the resulting need
                           for public health investments. Legislation should generate sufficient resources to
                           establish a health research fund and contribute significantly to other important
                           health objectives. In addition, Congress should repeal the provision giving the
                           tobacco industry a $50 billion credit.


                    5. Protection for Tobacco Farmers and Their Communities. The President made
           .clear today that any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities.
            Most tobacco farmers live arid work on small family farms; in many cases, their families have
            been growing tobacco for generations. In some states, entire communities rely on income from
            the tobacco crop. The Administration is committed to working with members of Congress in
            both parties to ensure that we protect the financial well-being of tobacco farmers, their families,
            and their communities.

                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
