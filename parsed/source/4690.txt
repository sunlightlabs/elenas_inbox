I.    PURPOSE

      To make remarks on the challenges facing families in the new economy. You will
      announce two new proposals to make leave more affordable for American workers, and
      release a new report that examines the "time crunch" that parents increasingly feel as they
      struggle to balance their responsibilities at home and at work.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will be addressing an audience of over 20,000 students, faculty, graduates and their
      families, and community members. Grambling State University has a student population
      of 5,770, and approximately 500 are graduating this year. The studerit body is 83%.
      African-American, and 58% of students m:e between the ages of20-25. Approximately
      95% of students receive financial aid, with 66% receiving PELL grants in 1998. The
      university is ranked 51h among all American colleges and universities in conferring
      baccalaureate degrees in all disciplines to African-Americans, and 151 in conferring
      bachelor or science degrees to African-Americans in the field of Computer and
      Information Science.

      Grambling State University is a public, coeducational, historically black university, and
      was founded in 1901 as a relief school for black farmers. At the request ofthe Farmers'
      Relief Association of Ruston, LA, Dr. Booker T. Washington sent Charles P. Adams
      from Tuskegee Institute to establish the Colored Industrial and Agricultural School of
      Lincoln Parish in 1901. In 1905 the school moved to its current location, and was
      renamed the North Louisiana Agricultural and Industrial Institute. The school expanded
      over the years, and was ultimately granted university status in 1974, at which time it
      adopted its present name. The Grambling State University motto is "The Place Where
      Everyone is Somebody".

request to confer upon you the honorary degree, Doctor ofLaws. This honorary degree
will be presented to you during the commencement ceremony.

At today's commencement you will make the following announcements:

Working to Make Parental Leave More Affordable. A 1996 study by the Commission
on Family and Medical Leave found that loss of wages was the most significant barrier to
parents taking advantage of unpaid leave following the birth or adoption of a child.
Today, you will direct the Secretary of Labor to propose new regulations and model state
legislation to enable states to develop innovative ways of using the Unemployment
Insurance (ill) system to support parents taking leave to care for a newborn or adopted
child. Several states recently have asked the Administration whether they could use the
UI system for this purpose consistent with federal law. The new regulations will
authorize this expansion of the UI system, thereby allowing states that wish to use
unemployment insurance to assist new parents to put their plans into effect.

Enabling Federal Workers to Take Paid Leave to Care for Sick Family Members.
In an effort to set an example for all employers, you will also direct the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) to revise its government-wide regulations to allow federal
employees to use up to 12 weeks of accrued sick leave each year to care for a spouse, son,
daughter, or parent with a "serious health condition," as that term is defined for the
purpose of applying the Family and Medical Leave Act. Currently, the amount of sick
leave that can be used to care for a family member who is ill is limited to 13 days each
year for most federal employees. By enabling federal workers to use the sick leave they
have earned, according to conditions established by the FMLA, this measure will remove
a significant barrier to caring for a family member with a serious health condition. You
will also direct the OPM to establish an Interagency Family Friendly Workplace Working
Group to develop, promote, and evaluate federal family friendly workplace initiatives.
You have previously taken other actions to ensure that the federal government is a model
employer, including: allowing federal employees to donate annual leave to other
employees; expanding flexible family-friendly work arrangements, such as job sharing,
career part-time employment, alternative work schedules, telecommuting, and satellite
work locations; and directing improvements in the quality of federally sponsored child
care.

A New Study on the Amount of Time Available for Families. You will release a
report by your Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) today that details the factors that
have led to decreased amounts of time available for parents to spend with their children.
The report, Families and the Labor Market, 1969-1999: Analyzing the "Time Crunch, "
demonstrates that the increase in hours mothers spend in paid work, combined with the
shift toward single-parent families, has resulted in families experiencing an average
decrease of22 hours a week (14 percent) in time that parents spend with their children.
The report concludes that the increased time at work among parents requires policy-
makers to seek new ways to promote strong families, including greater flexibility in paid


                                                                     Management System
                                                 Automated Recor cis
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
       parents, and methods for encouraging two-parent families to form and stay together.

       Advancing An Agenda To Help Parents Balance Their Responsibilities At Home
       And At Work. In your balanced budget request, you put forward a bold agenda to
       provide families with greater tools to meet their responsibilities at home and at work.
       This agenda includes: an historic initiative to make child care better, safer, and more
       affordable for working families; a tripling of our investment in after-school programs
       through the 21 sl Century Community Learning Center program; a new tax credit to help
       Americans struggling with long-term care costs; and proposals to expand the Family and
       Medical Leave law to cover more workers and allow leave for more parental activities,
       including parent-teacher conferences and routine doctor's visits.
