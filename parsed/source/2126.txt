                                                April 3, 1998

     MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

     FROM:                  Bruce Reed

     SUBJECT:               Monday's Meeting with Birch Bayh

             Fonner Senator Birch Bayh has wanted to meet with you for some time to discuss
     tobacco. In his initial letter, he said that he believes that "men and women of good faith in both
     political parties are prepared to make the compromises necessary to secure an accord. This will
     require the willingness to 'take a risk' politically to accomplish such a major break-through.
     Trust and reliance are fundamental ingredients in this regard. It is toward how best to ensure
     these elements that I believe a conversation between the two of us might prove helpful."

             You should know that according to news reports, Senator Bayh's finn, Bayh,
     Connaughton & Stewart, has worked since last November as a lobbyist for Richard Scruggs, the
     plaintiffs' attorney from Mississippi who worked with Mike Moore and other Attorneys General
     to launch the state suits against the tobacco industry. (Scruggs is also Senator Lott's brother in
     law.) The attorneys general and Scruggs worked closely with Senator McCain and his staff as
     they put together their legislation. For the most part, they tried to persuade Sen. McCain to stick
     closely to the tenns of the June 20th settlement. Several times during our Commerce Committee
     negotiations, they raised concerns that the industry would walk away from legislation raising
     prices by $1.10 per pack and imposing strong lookback penalties.

            If Bayh raises these concerns, you may want to make the following points:

           We believe the McCain bill represents dramatic progress. It meets the President's
            principles on several key issues, including a significant per-pack price increase. And it
            shows that we have real momentum in both parties to pass comprehensive tobacco
            legislation this year.

           Butwe also believe there's still room for improvement -- most notably, in the provisions
            on lookback penalties. We think the cap on these penalties is too low, and we favor
            incorporating some company-specific penalties into the lookback scheme.

           As the President said in his radio address on Saturday, we're not trying to put the tobacco
            companies out of business, and we do not believe our proposals will do so. We've had
            our Treasury Department experts look carefully at this issue, and they are strongly of the
            view that the companies can tolerate this burden.

           In fact, as the President said on Friday, we think the companies will still have a strong



                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

."

                                                                                                    2

         incentive to accept this sort of scheme voluntarily -- to put an end to this disgraceful
         chapter in their history and become partners in the effort to preyent youth smoking,
         We're inclined to think that industry opposition to the McCain legislation is largely
         designed to keep Congress from imposing still further price increases and penalties.

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
