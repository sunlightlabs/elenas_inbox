Application of Labor Laws

        As the work requirements of the new welfare law begin to go into effect, a critical
question for both the labor movement and the states is whether worker protection laws --
particularly the minimum wage law (Fair Labor Standards Act) -- protect welfare
recipients who take part in workfare or subsidized employment programs. The DPC and
OMB have been running an interagency process (involving DOL, HHS, USDA, and others)
to hammer out an answer to this question. We expect to have a recommendation for the
President within the next week, as well as a strategy for rolling out this controversial
Administration policy. The unions should view this recommendation, if approved, as
satisfactory.

        There is general agreement among the agencies, as a matter of both law and policy,
that the Fair Labor Standards Act should be read to require payment of at least the
minimum wage to most people in workfare and wage supplementation programs. On this
reading, participants in such programs usually would count as "employees" under the Act,
thus qualifying for minimum wage protection. (A few might count as "trainees," not
entitled to the minimum wage, under normal labor law principles that the unions would
expect to apply.) Bruce has given the AFL private assurances that the Administration will
adopt this basic position. And the Vice President dropped some strong hints to the same
effect at the recent AFL meeting.

        Requiring the minimum wage for workfare recipients, however, will raise obvious
difficulties for the states, in light of the new welfare law's work provisions. Even if a
recipient is working only 20 hours each week, the existing welfare grant in many states will
fall short of a minimum wage salary. As the work requirement in the law increases to 25
and then to 30 hours, and as the minimum wage also increases, more and more states will
discover that their welfare grants are insufficient.

       One way to mitigate this new burden on the states is to count benefits other than
cash assistance toward the minimum wage. There is a strong legal argument, based on
provisions in the food stamp law, that states may add the value of food stamps to the basic
welfare grant for purposes of complying with the minimum wage. Even if both these
streams of benefits are counted, however, a number of Southern states will immediately
come up short, and as the minimum wage increases and the work requirements become
more severe, other states will join them over time. Allowing states to count the value of
other benefits -- child care, housing, or transportation -- toward the minimum wage would
remove this problem, but this proposal raises a number of legal and policy questions that
make it difficult (though not impossible) to pursue.

      The interagency group also has reviewed what other labor protections apply to




                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

welfare recipients in workfare or subsidized employment programs. The consensus view is
that OSHA, unemployment insurance, and anti-discrimination laws will apply in the same
way they do for other workers. We do not yet have an absolutely final opinion from
Treasury as to whether the monies paid to these welfare recipients will be subject to FICA
and other taxes, and if these monies will make recipients eligible for the EITC, but all
indications are that they will not. Finally, these workers may well become eligible to
unionize. Recent newspaper articles have suggested that some unions will undertake
large-scale organizing efforts targeting welfare recipients, and we probably should expect
some of these efforts to succeed.

       We should expect the announcement of Administration policy along these lines to
provoke strong criticism from the States. Governor Whitman wrote to the President last
week that applying minimum wage laws to workfare participants would "end welfare
reform as we know it" by placing states in the position of either failing to meet the law's
work requirements or incurring large new costs. We also should not be surprised if
Congress reacts to our decision by passing a measure that would exempt workfare
participants from many labor protections, including the minimum wage, or that would
require benefits such as Medicaid and child care to count towards the minimum wage.
Even the New York Times editorial board, in discussing union plans to organize workfare
participants, has opined that "what they are doing does not amount to a job" -- a view
consistent with what the States and Congress will be saying.

       Talking Points:

             This Administration is committed to moving people from welfare to work. It's
              also committed to making sure workers get at least the minimum wage for their
              efforts. Workers shouldn't be paid a subminimum wage, whether or not they
              come off the welfare rolls.

             The Administration, however, is still studying precisely how the FLSA and other
              worker protection laws play out in the welfare context; in particular, we're trying
              to figure out if there are ways to address certain concerns that States have about
              how application of these laws would actually work. We may not be able to do
              that, but we thought it was worth making the effort to prevent a firestorm of
              opposition from Congress and the States.

             We know this decisionmaking process has taken longer than you -- or we --
              anticipated. But we thought it was worth the time to get things right. We expect
              to have a final answer within the next couple of weeks.

Allowing privatization of assistance programs through waivers:

        The new welfare law explicitly allows states to administer and provide Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) through contracts with private entities. Now, two
states (Texas and Wisconsin) are seeking federal approval to contract out certain functions
of the Food Stamp and Medicaid programs as well. (Private contractors determining
eligibility for Medicaid and Food Stamps would have to follow federal eligibility rules,
since those programs remain federally guaranteed individual entitlements.) These states
believe that a competitive contracting process will result in greater program efficiencies
while protecting recipients. Organized labor is concerned that privatizing these
government functions will displace state and local government workers (with a resulting
loss of union membership) and will undermine beneficiary rights to due process and
confidentiality.

        Federal agencies and the State of Texas have been negotiating since May 1996 over a
proposal from the State to privatize T ANF, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and certain other
federally-funded nutrition programs. Under the Texas plan, private contractors would
conduct the application and eligibility determination process, and the state would certify
the final determinations. The State also would retain control over the appeals and quality
control processes. HHS still has not responded to Texas's proposal. Rep. Charles
Stenholm, one of the Administration's strongest welfare reform allies, complained about
the delay to Frank Raines in a February 24th letter, saying the state of Texas is "willing to
make accommodations to address administration concerns." Secretary Shalala has
promised Texas an answer within two weeks.

       If the Administration does not allow private contracting for Food Stamps and
Medicaid, then states will be discouraged from contracting out the TANF program because
having separate eligibility systems would create administrative difficulties. For example, it
would require some individuals to go to one location to apply for T ANF and another to
apply for Food Stamps and Medicaid, whereas now nearly all states have one-stop,
government-run eligibility centers.

        Current Administration thinking on this issue is to allow Texas at least a partial
waiver, allowing the State to privatize public assistance operations now performed by State
employees. We are still debating whether the Administration should allow Texas to
privatize almost all of what it wants to, or whether the Administration should insist that
state employees retain control over certain public assistance functions (most notably, the
eligibility interview). We hope to have a recommendation for the President by the end of
the week.

      Talking Points:

             We appreciate your concerns about the effect of granting waivers to states to

    allow them to privatize public assistance operations, such as the Medicaid
    and Food Stamps program.

   It is important, if we do approve these waivers, to ensure adequate
    protections for recipients and assistance for displaced workers and we
    welcome any further information you'd like to give us on these issues over
    the next few weeks.

                                       MEDICAID ISSUES

 Background

  There is almost nothing about the Medicaid policy in the President's budget that AFSCME
  supports. They are opposed to having any Medicaid savings, arguing that recent downward
  baseline adjustments mitigate the need for further deficit reduction contributions by Medicaid.
  They oppose how we achieve the savings, arguing that a per capita cap could hurt vulnerable
  populations and that cuts in disproportionate share (DSH) payments will hurt public hospitals,
  the patients they serve, and the employees who work in the institutions. And finally, they are
  extremely uncomfortable with providing more administrative flexibility to the states, publicly
  arguing that it will subject beneficiaries to substandard care and reductions in access, and
. privately worrying that states will contract out with non-union employees to administer
  Medicaid.

 At this time, there is nothing we can do relative to AFSCME's concerns about how we achieve
 our savings. Our budget is now public and we certainly cannot run away from the per capita cap
 and the DSH savings proposals. Although they will grumble about our savings policy, AFSCME
 understands we cannot modify it at this stage in the process. Instead, they are focusing on two
 issues that they believe we can address: (1) the allocation ofDSH savings and (2) our yet to be
 submitted state flexibility language, particularly as it relates to personnel requirements.

 DSH Allocation/Targeting.

AFSCME and the public hospitals agree that there may be limited savings in DSH, but only ifit
is combined with much better targeting ofDSH dollars to the hospitals they say are providing
care to the greatest numbers of uninsured, underinsured and high cost Medicaid patients -- the
public hospitals. While most of the players (the private hospitals, public hospitals, physicians,
the unions, consumer groups, and even some states) all acknowledge there could be better
targeting, no one agrees on how best to do it. It is for this reason that we chose to punt on this
issue, saying that we wanted to work with interested parties on how best to design an improved
allocation formula. Consistent with that, we have already held meetings in the last week and a
half with both the unions and the public hospitals, and we plan do to more.

        Talking Points:

              I understand your concerns about both the size of the DSH cut and the need for
               better targeting of these dollars. We agree that we need to find ways to better
               target dollars, but -- as you know -- the devil is in the details.




                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

              We did not release a specific, new targeting fonnula because we thought it would
               more likely hurt, rather than help, the chances ofrefonning the current allocation
               approach. Ifwe went ahead with almost anything, the states and many hospitals
               would have used up all of their energy killing it, rather than working together to
               find consensus on this difficult issue.

              We have held some constructive preliminary meetings with your policy experts on
               this issue, and we plan on doing more. Let's keep talking to see if we can come
               up with something we both can agree on.

State flexibility/personnel requirement issues.

        AFSCME is particularly concerned about two provisions in our Medicaid flexibility
proposal: (A) the elimination of the waiver process for managed care and (B) a proposal
potentially allowing more extensive privatization of the Medicaid program.

        Elimination of managed care waivers. AFSCME opposes the elimination of the
managed care waiver process. They like this process because it gives them time to weigh in on
issues they are concerned about, thus giving them the opportunity to push the Department to
make changes before final approval. AFSCME recognizes, however, that our proposal to
eliminate the waiver process is extremely popular with the Governors and would be difficult to
back away from. Their more realistic goal is to persuade us to develop new quality standards that
would address many of the same concerns they now raise in the waiver process. While they will
push us in this direction, you should be careful about promising them to participate in our
Medicaid flexibility drafting process.

         Proposal allowing Medicaid privatization. AFSCME is significantly concerned about
our proposals to relax personnel requirements on state Medicaid programs. They charge that
such changes will undennine quality and, at least as important to AFSCME, potentially lead to
further reductions in force in Medicaid programs around the country. They believe, for example,
that allowing non-government employees to make eligibility detenninations may create conflict
of interest problems for companies that are also overseeing managed care plans. (AFSCME is
similarly concerned that the Administration will grant a waiver to certain states allowing them to
privatize significant parts of many of their public assistance programs, including Medicaid and
food stamps. An earlier section of this memo addresses these issues.)

        Unlike the new welfare law, our current Medicaid language does not unambiguously
allow states to completely privatize the administration of the program. The language could be
interpreted broadly, however, to allow quite extensive privatization. The Administration is still
trying to detennine exactly how we want to interpret our new Medicaid proposal, particularly on
the issue of whether it would allow private personnel to make eligibility determinations. We

     have an interagency/OMB/DPC working group finalizing our position in these issues.

            Talking Points:

                  I understand your concerns about the Medicaid flexibility provisions. We want to
                   work with you on these important issues.

                  While we cannot back-track on our position on the elimination of the waiver
                   process, we do want to work with you to assure that appropriate quality standards
                   are in place. When we send up the statutory language, you will see that we are
                   improving our Medicaid quality provisions.

                  We understand your concerns about the merit system protections. We are
                   committed to adopting an approach to administering Medicaid that assures a high
                   quality program. I know you have met with Donna Shalala on this issue and I
                   believe we should continue our conversations.
