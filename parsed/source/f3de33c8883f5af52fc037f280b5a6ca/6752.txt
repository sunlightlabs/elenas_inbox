         MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

         FROM:                 SECRETARY RILEY
                               BRUCE REED

         SUBJECT:              California Proposition 227 (Unz Initiative) to End Bilingual Education


                  On June 2, California voters will consider Proposition 227, otherwise known as the Unz
         Initiative, which proposes to eliminate all bilingual education. This is California's third
         potentially divisive race-related initiative in four years, following on the heels of Proposition
         187, which barred public benefits for illegal immigrants, and Proposition 209, which ended
         affirmative action.

                   Polls consistently show that the initiative is popular and is likely to pass. However, a
         strong opposition campaign could make this election close. Many Latino voters currently favor
         the initiative, although the polls show that Latino support has declined considerably as voters
         become more familiar with the details of the proposal. Latino activists are strongly opposed to
         Unz, and are looking to the White House to support their efforts to defeat Unz

                 Despite legitimate concerns over the effectiveness of some bilingual education programs,
         your advisors strongly believe that the Unz initiative is bad education policy and will harm
         students who need help the most. We also believe that you may be able to turn this issue to your
         political advantage if you combine opposition to Unz with proposals to reform bilingual
         education programs. Despite some tricky politics, we believe that it is both good policy and
         good politics to oppose Unz, coupled with proposals to "mend, not end" bilingual education.
         This memo lays out such a "mend, not end" approach.

         I.     The Unz Initiative and Bilingual Education in California

         A. Overview of the Unz Initiative

                 This initiative, authored and backed by Silicon Valley millionaire Ron Unz, is designed to
         end all bilingual education programs in California. More specifically, it would:

               Require that all public school instruction be conducted in English.
               Permit this requirement to be waived only if parents or guardians can show that the child
                already knows English, has special needs, or would learn English faster through an
                alternative instructional technique.
               Provide initial placement for Limited English Proficient CLEP) students in "sheltered


                                                         1
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


       English immersion" programs for one year. Instruction in these programs would be
       conducted in English, with some accommodations in the curriculum to take into account
       the limited English language skills of the students.
      Appropriate $50 million per year over 10 years to fund adult education programs
       designed to teach English to LEP adults who in tum pledge to provide English language
       tutoring to LEP students.
      Makes teachers, administrators and school board members subject to suits and personally
       liable for failure to implement the provisions of the initiative.

        Unz and other backers of this initiative regard the existing system of bilingual education
in the state as a complete failure. They argue that because bilingual education relies so heavily
on use of the students' native language and only slowly introduces English, the approach delays
or prevents, rather than promotes, the acquisition of English. Further, they point out that
although California's bilingual education law expired a decade ago, the legislature has been
unable to enact legislation to reform a broken program. This initiative, they argue, will break
the legislative impasse and dramatically change bilingual education policy for the better.

         Opponents criticize the Unz Initiative on a number of counts. Critics argue that the
initiative is harmful to children, because it relies on a single, unproven approach that provides an
unrealistic time period in which to learn English. They argue that this one-size-fits-all approach
eliminates parents' right to chose the best approach for their child (given that the waiver
provisions are very complicated and burdensome). They point out that the Unz initiative
provides no accountability, because it lacks any requirements for assessing students' academic
progress. They also charge that the Unz Initiative undermines local control and the ability of
local school boards to determine important education policies, and wrongly subjects educators to
lawsuits.

B. Bilingual Education in California

       Demographics. There are approximately 1.3 million Limited English Proficient (LEP)
students in California, approximately one quarter of California's K-12 students. This number
has nearly doubled in less than a decade, and represents some 43% of the national total. Seventy
nine percent of California's LEP students are native Spanish speakers. Hispanics have a 50%
dropout rate, and by most indicators their academic performance lags behind most other
population groups in the state.

        Educational Services. LEP students receive a wide variety of services intended to help
them learn English and academic subjects. In 1997, only about 30% received what is
conventionally considered bilingual education--programs which make significant use of the
student's primary language to teach academics while phasing in greater amounts of English
language instruction. More than half participate in specially designed instructional programs
that help students learn English through a combination of approaches such as direct instruction in
grammar, vocabulary and communications, while teaching other subjects in a ~ay designed to be


                                                 2
                                                                                 Automated Records Management Syste:
                                                                                         Hex-Dump ConversIon

     accessible to LEP students. The Unz Initiative would eliminate these programs as well as
     conventional bilingual programs. Approximately 16% are not receiving any language
     instruction services at all.

             Almost no one believes that the services now provided to LEP students are effective on a
     large scale basis. While program evaluations have identified some promising efforts, shortages
     of qualified teachers and poor implementation has limited the effectiveness of existing programs.
      In addition, most observers agree that the overall poor academic performance and high dropout
     rate of Hispanic students reflects serious weaknesses in schools that extend well beyond language
     services for LEP students.

             The research on instruction for LEP students does not identifY any approach (~
     bilingual education, English immersion, English as a Second Language, or dual-language
     immersion) as particularly effective. Rather, it suggests that effective programs are those that fit
     the needs and resources of the local community; have well-prepared teachers who know how to
     teach reading and who are knowledgeable about second language acquisition; provide students
     with a challenging curriculum and high academic standards; and regularly assess student progress
     and make adjustments in the instructional program accordingly. Consequently, while much of
     the debate about educating LEP students centers on the relative merits of one program over
     another, research and experience suggest that attention to program quality regardless of program
     type is more important.

            California Legal Framework. The legal framework for providing services to LEP
     students in California is particularly murky. California's Bilingual Education Act sunseted in
     1987, but the State Board of Education regulations implementing the act have remained in effect.
     Under this framework, school districts are required to help students become fluent in English and
     competent in other academic subjects, and are given a significant amount of flexibility in
     determining how to achieve these goals. Neither bilingual education nor any other specific
     approach to teaching LEP students is required.

              There have been a number of unsuccessful attempts in the past decade to enact new
     legislation, but bilingual education reformers and advocates have been unable to agree on an
     approach. There has been a fresh attempt over the past month to craft compromise legislation,
     partly to take the steam out ofUnz andto give Unz opponents something to support. This
     effort, however, is l~kely to end in failure.

             Last week the State Board of Education took the first step toward eliminating the state
     bilingual education regulations. This process should be completed shortly before the vote on
     Unz. The effect of this action will be to eliminate any state requirement for the provision of
     specific services to LEP students, and to give local school districts even greater flexibility in this
     area.

            Federal Legal Framework. Federal requirements originate in the Due Process and'


                                                       3
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and provisions of the Equal Educational
Opportunities Act which require educational agencies to take appropriate action to overcome
language barriers that impede equal participation by students in instructional programs.

       As interpreted by the courts, these provisions do not require any specific form of services,
~uch as Bilingual Education or English as a Second Language. They instead require the
provision of supplemental language instruction that is based on sound educational theory, is
adequately resourced and implemented, and is evaluated and modified as necessary.

        IfUnz is enacted, many expect that it will be challenged as a violation of federal law.
Department of Education lawyers believe that the success of such suits will depend on whether
the services mandated by Unz are implemented effectively. Absent implementation problems,
federal law appears to provide sufficient flexibility to allow California to approve this approach.
However, if services mandated by Unz are not implemented effectively, there is likely to be a
strong basis for a legal challenge.

        The federal Bilingual Education program (Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act) similarly does not preclude the Unz approach. This competitive grant program
also provides local school districts with considerable discretion in the kind of services provided
to students.

II.    Political Context

        The Unz initiative is currently the most serious threat to bilingual education, but it is not
likely to be the last. Earlier this year Speaker Gingrich proposed eliminating bilingual
education, and some conservative education experts (~, Diane Ravitch) have also called for its
elimination. Especially ifUnz passes, we are likely to see energized opposition to the federal
program, and increased opposition in other states and localities.

        The Unz initiative presents a political dilemma in California. If we oppose it, we
risk alienating a majority of California Anglo voters. If we fail to oppose it, we risk alienating a
vocal and increasingly influential group of Latino leaders, and possibly Latino voters.

        Current polls show that a large majority of California Anglo voters support Unz. For
Anglos, bilingual may become a hot button issue similar to immigrant services and affirmative
action. In contrast, Latino voters are split on the issue of bilingual education. While many
continue to support Unz largely out offrustration at the public schools' failure to help their
children, polls show that Latino support is eroding as they become more aware of the particulars
of the initiative. And the polls tended to underestimate Latino opposition to Prop. 187 and Prop.
209

         Latino activists and electeds oppose Unz. To some of the Latino leaders, Unz is a litmus
issue, like Propositions 187 and 209. Latino leaders are looking to the White House to become

                                                                               Automated Records Management Sysler
                                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
        actively involved in the opposition to Unz, and are fearful that we will choose to sit on the
        sidelines.

                 More organizations and elected officials are taking positions on Unz. The California
        education community -- including the California Teachers Association and the California
        School Boards Association -- is strongly opposed to Unz. Key Democratic officeholders
        (including Sen. Boxer, Rep. Becerra and most Democrats in the California delegation, State
        Superintendent Delaine Eastin, and Speaker Villaraigosa) have also announced their opposition
        to the Unz initiative. All three Democratic gubernatorial candidates have come out against Unz.
         Sen. Feinstein has not taken a public stance yet, though she appears likely to support Unz. A
        list of organizations, elected officials and other leaders that have taken positions on Unz is
        attached.
                             .                                 ,
                 The Republican state party has supported Unz, though many Republican officials,
        including Gov. Wilson, have not yet taken a position. Dan Lungren has not taken a position yet,
        but has recently said that the recent action by the State Board of Education has eliminated the
        need for Unz. There is always a chance that White House opposition to Unz could polarize the
        situation, and push Gov. Wilson and other RepUblicans to support Unz; yet some Republican
        leaders are afraid to support another initiative viewed as anti-Hispanic.

               The political dilemma can be resolved with a "Mend it / Don't End it" response.
        We believe the best approach to this issue is to strike a middle ground by admitting that bilingual
        education needs mending, but asserting that Unz is not the way to do it. More specifically, we
        can:
              Start by reiterating the overriding importance of helping every child become proficient in
               English;
              Oppose Unz on the merits because it is too extreme;
              Remind voters what we are for, including both our overall approach to public education
               and our Hispanic initiative;
              Propose to "mend" the federal bilingual education program through steps that will create
               expectations for learning English within a fixed period of time; strengthen accountability
               for students and programs alike by testing for English proficiency; strengthen local

        III.   Specific Recommendations

        1. Announce opposition to Unz within next 4 weeks

               We recommend that you or another senior Administration official (the Vice President or
        Secretary Riley) announce the Administration's opposition to the Unz initiative within the next
        4 weeks. Taking a position in the next month will allow us to frame the debate and set a
        constructive tone, rather than get sucked into an already inflammatory debate. We could tum

     this initiative into an opportunity to fit bilingual education into our overall framework for
     ensuring effective education in the 21st century.

     2. Specific recommendations for changing federal bilingual education program

             In accord with our recommendation for a "mend, don't end" approach to bilingual
     education, we believe that opposition to Unz should be coupled with specific proposals to change
     the federal bilingual education program. This approach will lend credibility to our position, and
     give us a basis for framing the debate over bilingmil education. Specifically, we recommend the
     following changes:

             Strengthen local control by lifting the existing cap on English programs. The current
     federal bilingual program contains a ceiling that permits only 25% of all funds to be used to
     support English-only programs. Since most participating school districts use a variety of
     approaches, the cap has not limited local approaches--though it is perceived as having that effect.
      Lifting the cap would add credibility to our call for local control (rather than the Unz
     one-size-fits-all approach) in California, and would help address the concerns of conservative
     critics. This action, however, would be unpopular with the bilingual advocacy community.

             Create expectations for students to learn English within 3 years.           One of the most
     powerful criticisms of bilingual education programs is that they in fact prolong the time it takes
     for students to learn English. This criticism resonates with many opponents as well as
     supporters ofUnz. We shouldpropose amending the federal bilingual education program to
     require that students learn English well enough to then learn other subjects in English, within 3
     years, with additional time and services provided to students facing unusual circumstances.
     Setting clear expectations for how quickly students .will master English will appropriately focus
     the efforts of schools and students and help more students become proficient in English. This
     action would be unpopular with the bilingual advocacy community. Advocates and researchers
     will argue that there is no clear research base to establish a 3-year time frame--and, indeed that
     more time is necessary for students to master English and other subjects.

            Because of these concerns, some of your advisors feel that learning English within 3 years
     should be a goal, rather than a requirement, of federal programs.

             Strengthen testing and accountability for students and programs. Programs should
     be required to test students periodically for English proficiency (as well as achievement in other
     subjects) to determine if they are making adequate progress toward the 3-year deadline, and to
     provide additional services or take other corrective actions as appropriate when students not
     making adequate progress. There should also be additional accountability for school districts
     participating in the bilingual education program. Programs are already required to undergo
     evaluations; this requirement can be strengthened by establishing consequences, such as possible
     withholding of funds, from programs that fail to make adequate progress as measured by student
     achievement.

             Underscore efforts to strengthen the quality of programs that provide services to
     LEP students. We should highlight your budget request to increase funding for teacher training
     within the bilingual education program. The Education Department should also undertake a
     vigorous effort, through technical assistance and effective dissemination approaches, to
     emphasize that any program for LEP students must be based on fundamental principles of
     quality: ensuring well-trained teachers, high standards and a quality curriculum, testing and
     accountability measures. The Education Department should also help the programs it funds
     work more effectively to engage parents in their children's learning.
