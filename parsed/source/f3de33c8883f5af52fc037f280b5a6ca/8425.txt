TEXT:
This summarizes OMB and Treasury's analyses, and includes an updated side
by side.  I will fax to Laura the original memos from Gotbaum and Gruber
should you need them.

Remember, Erskine's note also asked about "what we would need to do to
change Hatch."
You may wish to write a cover memo to discuss that, or to send this and
send a cover memo later.   ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

                                       Review of Hatch Analysis

OMB and the Treasury Dept. disagree with the Hatch's analysis as shown in the table below:

                                               Hatch Estimate                   OMBITreasury Estimate
                                          (25 year cost, real 1999$)          (25 year cost, real 1999$)

    McCain Base Payment                          $574 billion                        $408 billion

    McCain Lookback Surcharges·                  $132 billion                         $59 billion

    Total McCain                                 $ 706 billion                       $467 billion

    Hatch Base Payment                           $408 billion                        $291 billion

    Hatch Lookback Surcharges                    $204 billion                         $80 billion

    Hatch Total                                  $612 billion                        $371 billion



· These figures are for the lookback surcharges before the Durbin amendment. With the Durbin amendment, Hatch
thinks the surcharges raise $236 billion and Treasury thinks they raise $94 billion.

The Hatch analysis overstates the gross payments manufacturers will make by:

·         Confusing real and nominal payments in their comparisons. For example, the equivalent
          of the proposed settlement's $368 billion and Hatch's $408 billion is $516 billion for
          McCain, not $574.

·         Ignoring the effects of the volume adjustment and the price cap agreed to by McCain,
          which would reduce the 25-year payments from $516 billion (in 1999 dollars) to $408
          billion.

·         Ignoring the fact that net receipts available to the government will be reduced by lost
          income and excise taxes and other offsets. As a result, it overstates the funds that will be
          available under the HatchlFeinstein proposal.

With the volume adjustments, OMB believes that Congressional scorekeepers would estimate the
25-year gross payments as $267 billion for the proposed settlement (64 cents per pack) $291
billion for Hatch (66 cents per pack) and $408 billion for McCain ($1.10 per pack).

There are several problems with Hatch's analysis oflookback surcharges. The most significant
is that it assumes that the companies will pay the maximum lookback surcharge and that they
will do so every year. Both we and CBO/JCT think that is extremely unlikely.

Also attached is a more detailed financial comparison prepared by OMB staff of the Hatch,
McCain, and proposed settlement (excluding lookback surcharges), as well as a side-be-side
summarizing the policy provisions of the three proposals.
