        This sounds like a good idea to me -- congratulating IOC/OSOC for their
        action - positive way to make an antidrug, pro-healthy young statement
        --what do you think ?

        Olympics and Drugs

          The Executive Board of the IOC announced today a ban on marijuana and
        other non performance enhancing or social drugs.
         This is a huge step forward that will not only impact the Olympics, but
        also the entire world of amateur international sport (which typically
        adopts the Olympic rules).
         We should make a strong statement in support of this effort of the IOC
        and the USOC, which has been a true leader in making this happen.
         The PresidentO,s meet with/remarks to provide the perfect opportunity to
        do so -- hitting strong on the values embody by sport, O&ensuring that no
        medal gold or other is tarnished by drugs.OB

        Note
         The athlete who had the mar~Juana incident is a Canadian; he is not
        invited tomorrow.  I have checked the lists to be certain of this.



Double Bonus
 This would be a big blow to Gingrich who has hauled out the Olympics as
part of his bash the President on drugs event -- a total thunder steal.

option
 ONDCP has a new Athletics Initiative that could also be' announced --
O&working with the leagues, coaches, soccer moms and Dads, and most
importantly kids to use athletics to build values and send the right
message to kids about drugs: Users are losers.  Be a winner.OS
