 Subject:         CRCC draft agenda

 Please find attached a draft agenda for tomorrow's CRCC meeting. Unlike
 our internal working meetings, the focus of this meeting is to brief the
 heads of the civil rights offices of the various agencies (e.g. Ida
 Castro, Bill Lann Lee). The last time we met with them was on March 4,
 and we thought it important to update them on our progress.

 This meeting will NOT be a working meeting, only a status update meeting.
 As you can see from the agenda, I am proposing that each of you provide a
 3-5 minute update on our issues areas. As there are 10 issue areas in
 addition to environmental justice, we have to be speedy.   Please review
 and let me know what you think.   I am open to any and all suggestions
 (including changing the format).   If you could get comments to me by COB
 today, I would appreciate it.   I will then forward to Chuck and Maria.
 Thanks.
