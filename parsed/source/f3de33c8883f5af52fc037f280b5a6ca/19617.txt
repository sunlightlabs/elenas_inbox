    PRESIDENT CLINTON SAYS NEW SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT UNDERSCORES
       THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE BIPARTISAN TOBACCO LEGISLATION
                                April 27, 1998

President Clinton said today that a new Surgeon General's report on tobacco underscores the urgent
need for comprehensive legislation to reduce youth smoking. Over the last six years, youth smoking
has increased by one third. Smoking has increased among young people of all races and ethnicities,
growing by a startling 80 percent among African American youth. Today, 40 percent of white high
school students smoke, as do one-half of young Native Americans, one third of Hispanics, and
one-fifth of Asian and African Americans. Every day, 3000 children become regular smokers -- and
1000 of them will die as a result. This report -- the first to be released by newly appointed Surgeon
General David Satcher -- is the first comprehensive source of data on the use and health effects of
tobacco among ethnic groups.

The Surgeon General's Report Documents Disturbing Trends in Tobacco Use. African
Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and American Indians/Alaska Natives make up nearly
one-fourth of the United States population. The report provides a comprehensive analysis on the
effect of tobacco on these groups, including that:

      Teen smoking rates are rising in all ethnic groups.

              Teen smoking rates rose dramatically among African-Americans and Hispanics from
              1991-1997. Smoking rates among African-American high school students were up by a
              startling 80 percent, and smoking rates among Hispanic high school students increased
              by 34 percent. Smoking among white high school students increased from 31 to 40
              percent.

              The most recent data also shows disturbing trends among Asian American and
              American Indian/Alaska Native youth. From 1990 to 1995, cigarette smoking
              increased by 17 percent among Asian American 12th graders and by 26 percent among
              their American Indian and Alaska Native counterparts.

              The report also documents that American Indians have the highest adult smoking rates
              of any ethnic or minority group in the United States -- nearly 40 percent, compared to 25
              percent of all adults.

      Cigarette smoking is a major cause of death and disease among all minority and ethnic
       groups. The report documents that:

              Lung cancer is the leading cancer death for all four minority groups. The increase in
              youth smoking threatens to reverse recent progress made against lung cancer among
              these groups.

              African-American men bear the greatest health burdens from lung cancer, with death
              rates about 50 percent higher than whites. Lung cancer incidence has increased
              substantially among Alaska Natives (93 percent increase for men and 241 percent
              increase for women) since the 1970s.
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversior           .
               Smoking increases infant mortality and low birth weight, with the risk of low birth
               weight babies almost twice as high for smokers than for non-smokers. Among
               smokers, the rate of sudden infant death syndrome is particularly high among Hispanics,
               African Americans, and Asians.

      The tobacco industry has targeted advertising and promotion campaigns in ethnic and
       minority communities that pose serious challenges to reducing smoking among this
       population. The report found that:

               Tobacco products are advertised intensively in racial and communities. For example,
               in one city, 62 percent of billboards in predominantly African American neighborhoods
               advertised cigarettes, compared with 36 percent of billboards citywide.

      More research is needed to understand racial and ethnic smoking patterns and to reduce
       tobacco use among racial and ethnic minorities.

               The Surgeon General's report highlights successful community-based tobacco
               prevention and cessation programs, as well as successful federal programs that are
               tailored to the needs of specific minority and ethnic communities.

                The report, however, demonstrates the need for further research to develop the
                         prevention and cessation programs that will be most effective in minority
                         communities.
The President Renewed His Call for Comprehensive Bipartisan Tobacco Legislation. The
President emphasized that this report again demonstrates the need to pass bipartisan comprehensive
tobacco legislation to reduce youth smoking this year. Noting that Senator McCain's bill is a strong
step in the right direction, the President renewed his call for Congress to send him legislation that:

      Raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years and imposes tough
       penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids;

      Confirms the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products;

      Gets tobacco companies out of the business of marketing to children;

      Furthers public health research and goals; and

      Protects tobacco farmers and their communities.
