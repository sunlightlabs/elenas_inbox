                    Improvements to the Senate Juvenile Crime Legislation


       Three out of four "core mandates" preserved. Senator Hatch's bill originally
        weakened all of the core protections for juveniles in state custody. The bill that cleared
        the Senate today preserves language in current law ensuring that juveniles are separated
        by sight and sound from adults while incarcerated; that they are not placed in adult jails;
        and that status offenders are not incarcerated. However, the bill does re-write
        protections against disproportionate minority confinement. A Kennedy/Wellstone
        amendment to drop this provision was defeated, and this issue will have to be revisited in
        conference.

       Guaranteed prevention funds. The original Hatch bill provided almost no funds for
        prevention. The bill that passed today sets aside 25 percent of the $450 million Juvenile
        Accountability Block Grant for prevention, and authorizes a separate $435 million for
        other delinquency and prevention programs.

       No new death penalties. The original Hatch bill made 16-year olds eligible for the
        federal death penalty. This provision has been dropped.

       Onerous conditions on states deleted. To be eligible for the new block grant funds, the
        original Hatch bill required states to pass new laws to prosecute juveniles (14-year olds)
        as adults. These hard requirements have been dropped and replaced with more
        reasonable conditions requiring graduated sanctions, drug testing and protection of
        victims rights in cases involving juvenile offenders.

       Federalization clause dropped. The original Hatch bill included a presumption that all
        juvenile crime should be federal and then referred to states as appropriate. Chief Justice
        Rehnquist complained bitterly last year about this provision, and it is no longer in the bill.

       New gun provisions. The original Hatch bill contained no provision to address gun
        violence. As you know, the new bill: (I) requires background checks for all gun sales at
        gun shows; (2) requires gun dealers to provide child safety locks with every handgun
        sold; (3) bans the juvenile possession of assault weapons and large capacity clips; (4)
        expands the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative; (5) bans the importation oflarge
        capacity ammunition clips; (6) prohibits violent juveniles from possessing guns (but in a
        weaker form than your own proposal); and (7) provides $50 million for the increased
        federal prosecution of gun crimes.

Nancy just called me to express, on behalf of LCCR, her chagrin over the
handling of LEP issues in Title 1. She also informed me that she will take
MALDEF to meet with Clay after Mr. Clay introduces our bill.  So we just
dodged the final bullet and are on our way!
