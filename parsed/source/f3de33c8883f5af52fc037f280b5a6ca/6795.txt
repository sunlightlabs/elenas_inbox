DRAFT MEMORANDUM FOR THE DPCI NEC

FROM:                 DPCINEC STAFF

SUBJECT:              Equal Pay Initiative

        This memorandum outlines the "Equal Pay" initiative the Vice President could announce
on April 3rd. Many organizations around the country hold events on April 3rd, which is "Equal
Pay Day," the day designated as the date on which women's earnings, added to their previous
year's earnings, are said to equal what men earn in one calendar year. This event would be the
message event of the day, and it is expected that representatives from the Department of Labor,
OPM, and other departments will attend the event with the Vice President.

        There are numerous studies attempting to determine the degree of wage differences
between men and women. A recent brief review of existing studies in the area by the Council of
Economic Advisors concludes that while wage differentials have narrowed steadily since the late
1970s, there is still a significant wage differential, even after controlling for education,
experience, and occupation. The raw differential in terms of female and male wage ratios is
72.4. Taking into account education and experience, the differential becomes 80.5. The wage
differential further narrows to 88.2, controlling for occupation, industry, and union status. A
more popular figure, cited for instance by the Department of Labor, states women earn on
average only 75 cents for each dollar a man earns.

        On April3rd, the Vice President could announce: (1) the Administration's endorsement
of Senator Daschle's pay equity bill with some changes; (2) an annual study on pay discrepancies
to highlight this important problem; and (3) other executive branch initiatives in the areas of
enforcement, technical assistance, and outreach.

I.      Endorsement of Daschle Bill

        The most prominent (and mainstream) bill in Congress regarding fair pay is Senator
Daschle's. Congresswoman DeLauro has introduced the companion bill to Senator Daschle's in
the House. Rep. Gephardt is looking to support an equal pay initiative and is likely to introduce
whatever bill we support. There is agreement with almost all of the provisions in the Daschle
bill. However, there are two issues that raise some concern. We set forth below the provisions
in the Daschle bill, along with a discussion of the issues that warrant further discussion. You
approach because it incorporates "comparable worth" which would be difficult, if not impossible,
to administer.

       A.      Provisions in Daschle's bill that the Administration supports:

             Non-retaliation Provision. The Daschle bill includes a Non-retaliation provision
              that amends the Equal Pay Act (EPA) to prohibit employers from penalizing
              employees for sharing information about their salaries with coworkers. Lack of
              ability to share such information makes it more difficult for women to evaluate
              whether there is evidence of wage discrimination.

              Class Actions. The bill amends the procedures for filing class actions under
               the EPA to conform with the general procedural rules for filing federal class
               actions in other areas of the law.

              Trainine:. Research, Education. and Outreach. The Daschle bill provides for
               training, research, education, and outreach. The bill requires the EEOC to
               provide training for its employees, subject to the availability of funding, on
               matters involving discrimination in the payment of wages. The bill also
               enhances programs already in place at the Department of Labor, requiring
               DOL to undertake research in the area of sex-based pay disparities;
               disseminate that information to members of the interested public; provide
               information on means of eradicating such disparities; assist State and local
               information and educational programs; recognize and promote the
               achievements of employers that have made strides to eliminate pay
               disparities; and convene a national summit to discuss and highlight the issue
               of sex-based pay disparities.

              Pay Equity Award. The bill establishes "The National Award for Pay
               Equity in the Workplace," to be administered by the Women's Bureau of the
               Department of Labor, to recognize and promote the achievements of
               employers that have made strides to eliminate pay disparities.


       B. Provisions in Daschle's bill that raise some concerns:

       1. Enhanced Enforcement.

       Daschle's bill would amend the EPA to allow for compensatory and punitive damages.
Currently, the EPA only allows for liquidated damages and back-pay awards. Liquidated
damages typically are awarded in an amount equal to back pay. And typical recoveries are
double back-pay awards.


                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                2                        HeX-Dump Conversion .
EPA. Title VII allows for compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to back pay, as
a result of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Under Title VII, however, these damages are
capped -- to no more than between $50,000 and $300,000, depending on the size of the
employer -- not the severity of the offense (e.g., for firms with between 15 and 100
employees, combined damages are capped at $50,000).

       Victims of racial or ethnic discrimination in employment can also sue for wage
discrimination under Section 1981, which allows unlimited damages. This leaves victims of
discrimination based on sex, religion or disability limited in the relief they can receive.

         The Daschle bill adds unlimited compensatory and punitive damages to the Equal
  Pay Act. This provides more than is currently authorized under Title VII, but achieves
. parity with racial and ethnic discrimination awards under Section 1981.

       A number of advocates believe that increasing the damages available under the EPA
would encourage the private bar to bring more suits under the statute, encourage
employers to devote more attention to their pay practices, and encourage victims to come
forward. Adding unrestricted damages to equal pay cases would not necessarily lead to a
huge proliferation of frivolous actions or excessive awards. An examination of cases under
Section 1981 found that between 1980 and 1990 plaintiffs won 121 cases -- eleven per year.
There were no compensatory and punitive damages in 52 of the cases; in 42, damages
awarded were less than $50,000. Total damages exceeded $200,000 in only two cases
during the eleven-year period. Note: this study was limited to reported decisions, and did
not include cases settled before trial.

        The women's groups have long advocated lifting the caps in Title VII and view any
limits on damages in the EPA as an abandonment of their position for equal relief and as
an affront to women rights generally. In fact, if the Administration did not support
uncapped damages in the Daschle bill, the women's groups would feel betrayed, preferring
no bill at all. In addition, they have indicated that they would publicly attack the
Administration on this issue.

        The Departments of Labor, Treasury, Justice, and the Commissioner of the EEOC all
support endorsing adding uncapped compensatory and punitive damages to the EPA, with the
exception that the Department of Justice believes that punitive damages should not be available
against the Federal Government. The NEC, DPC, Women's Office, CEA, and OMB agree.
Commerce remains concerned.

       2. Data Collection

        Daschle's bill also provides for the collection of pay information by the EEOC.
Daschle's bill is somewhat vague on exactly how the wage data would be collected. In
particular, it does not specify that the data needs to be collected on the EEO-l form, which is the


                                                 3
                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion .
we believe we need to work with Daschle's staff to remove this section of the bill.

       Data collection could improve pay equity in two ways. The first is by increasing public
awareness of pay inequities and enabling women to evaluate whether they have been victims of
wage discrimination; the second is by enhancing enforcement of anti-discrimination laws.

        The EEOC currently collects annual data regarding the demographic breakdown of the
workforces of private employers with 100 or more employees and of federal contractors with 50
or more employees on the EEO-l form. The EEOC does not currently collect salary data with
respect to private employers.


        The EEO-l form has remained virtually unchanged for the past 30 years, despite its
review every 3 years for OMB paperwork clearance (most recently in 1997). Since the 1960s,
the occupation and racial categories have become outdated; what was once confusing is now
potentially misleading. As a result, many in the business community perceive the EEO-l form
as a waste of time and money. (OMB estimates suggest that it takes each firm 10 hours to fill
out the form; adding wage data would likely increase the compliance costs dramatically --
possibly by several hundred-fold -- although creating a supplement to the form or limiting it to a
subset of the reporting universe could mitigate some of these costs.)

        Nonetheless, the EEOC believes that collecting wage data on the EEO-l form would
greatly improve its ability to target and prioritize discrimination cases. It also would assist the
Department of Labor (DOL) in targeting its enforcement efforts and monitoring affirmative
action programs. Because DOL thought that the EEO form would not be amended to include
wage information, it has been working on a proposed rule to gather such data from federal
contractors though an OFCCP form. That work has been in process for almost three years; we
now understand that it may be ready to be sent to OMB dUring this fiscal year.

        There is consensus that any attempts to add wage data to the EEO-l form will draw
immediate fire from the Republicans and the business community. Indeed, any announcement
of a process to determine the beSt way to gather this data would likely provoke a rider and risk
the increase in funds requested for the EEOC in our FY99 budget. (The budget requests $279
million for the EEOC -- $37 million or 15 percent more than enacted in the 1998 budget.
More than one-third of the proposed increase, $13 million, goes to expansion of the
agency's Alternate Dispute Resolution [ADR) program.)

        Since the EEO-l form is up for revision in the year 2000, as part ofthe Paperwork
Reduction Act, the consensus among the working group is that we should work to remove the
data collection provision from the Daschle bill and should work quietly to evaluate the options
for addressing the existing problems with the form (e.g., the outdated occupational and racial
categories, and the lack of wage data).

                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

        In order to increase public awareness of pay inequities, the Vice President could
announce an annual report on the pay gap by sex produced by the Department of Labor. This
annual report would be based on data that already exist, but are very difficult for most people to
utilize. Publishing the information on pay inequities in an easy-to-access report would make it
easier for interested parties to raise the national prominence of this problem. And because
attitudes and awareness are keys to reducing wage disparities, highlighting the issue every year
would likely have a powerful effect on public consciousness and be an effective way to achieve
increased gender pay equity. This announcement will not be politically charged since it would
not impose additional burdens on business. This option would not enhance enforcement efforts
and would not involve significant costs.
II.     Other Executive Branch Announcements

       A.      Private-Sector Enforcement

       Enforcement of anti-discrimination laws by the EEOC and OFCCP have traditionally
played an important role in easing discrimination in our labor market. Therefore, a key
component to our equal pay initiative is to improve enforcement by both agencies.

       1.      A Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) between EEOC and DOL to
               Cross Train. The EEOC and the Department of Labor could enter into an
               agreement to train each other's stafftobe sensiti~e to potential violations of the
               statutes they enforce, including the Equal Pay Act. The agencies would refer
               information concerning potential violations of the agency's statutes to the
               applicable EEOC or Labor Department office for appropriate action.

       2.      A MOU Between EEOC and DOL to Collect Damages. OFCCP would be
               designated to serve as the EEOC's agent for purposes of collecting damages that
               are not otherwise collectible under OFCCP's authority under its executive order.
               OFCCP then could obtain full relief for intentional discrimination. This change
               would not require any legislative action. There are no costs anticipated for this
               option.

       B. Private-Sector Technical Assistance

        There are several areas in which the federal government could provide technical
assistance to make private employers aware of wage disparities.

       1.      Federal Contractor Best Practices. Currently, federal contractors must
               conduct self-audits as part of their federal contract obligations. OFCCP has
               begun to publicize successful programs through its best practices honor roll.
               The agency plans to place these Best Practices suggestions on its web site.


                                                 5                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion



            2.     lO-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Businesses and Employees. The
                   Department of Labor would develop and make available a 10-step package that
                   would give companies guidelines to determine whether they offer equal pay,
                   hiring, and promotional opportunities. The Department would also develop a
                   similar checklist for employees. DOL would put these self-audits on the Internet.
                    This would require no additional funding.

            3.     Awards. The Department of Labor has an Exemplary Voluntary Efforts (EVE)
                   and Secretary's Opportunity 2000 Awards program that recognizes best corporate
                   practices. This year's event will be held on September 17. This existing vehicle
                   could be used to highlight the best practices in furthering pay equity. There is
                   also an award proposed in the Daschle bill.


            C.     Federal Government As A Role Model

            For any equal pay initiative to be credible, we must make the Federal government the role
     model for other employers. To this end, we would propose the following four initiatives to put
     the Federal government in the lead on this issue and address discrimination within the Federal
     government:

            1.     lO-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Agencies. The federal agencies will agree to
                   take the 10-step self-audit that the Department of Labor would develop and use
                   the results from the self-audit to monitor their efforts on equal pay.

            2.     Best Practices. OPM could work with the other Federal departments and
                   agencies to develop best practices, from both the public and private sectors, for
                   recruiting and retaining women.

            3.     Guide to Recruitment and Retention of Women. OPM is producing a new
                   Guide on Recruitment and Retention of Women in the federal government that
                   would contain infonnation to make agency managers aware of career
                   opportunities for women and to provide guidance on recruitment and career
                   development for women. This could be prepared by April 3rd.

            4.     Outreach. OPM, in conjunction with other agencies, could expand outreach
                   efforts, including working with professional groups, participating in women's
                   conferences, and visiting college campuses so that talented women may be
                   recruited for jobs in the Federal government.

                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
