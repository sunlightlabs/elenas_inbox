TEXT:
The Treasury/Postal FY99 bill is scheduled for action on the House Floor
later today.  The only changes from the T/P Rules SAP cleared and sent
yesterday can be found in the FEHBP section, paragraph 3 on the Coburn
amendment. Also, we have removed the Brady Act Dissemination of Public
Information sections. We need your review immediately and provide
comments/clearance no later than 6:15pm tonight. As always, thank you.

H.R. 4104 -- TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT
                                 APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY
1999
(Sponsors:  Livingston (R), Louisiana; Kolbe (R), Arizona)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdrninistrationD,s views on the Treasury and General Government


Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Appropriations
Committee.   Your consideration of the AdministrationO,s views would be
appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b) allocation.  The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending.
In the Tecently enacted Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad,
bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface
transportation programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We encourage the
Congress to take advantage of such additional offsets, or to reduce
appropriations for programs or projects not requested by the President in
order to fund requested levels for items discussed below.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Committee-reported bill. We look forward to working with you to resolve
these concerns as the bill moves forward.

Year 2000 Computer Conversion

        The Administration appreciates the emphasis that the Committee has
placed on year 2000 (Y2K) computer conversion activities. OMB will
continue to assist all agencies in ensuring that adequate resources are
available to address this critical issue.  In the FY 1999 Budget, the
President has requested more than $1 billion for Y2K computer conversion.
In addition, the budget anticipated that additional requirements would
emerge over the course of the year and included an allowance for
emergencies and other unanticipated needs.

         As we learn more about how to'address this problem, we expect that
ensuring Government-wide compliance will require flexibility to respond to
unanticipated requirements.    To the extent such unanticipated requirements
are identified, it will be essential to make that funding available
quickly.    It will truly be emergency funding.  The emergency mechanism
recently approved by the House Appropriations Committee provides such
flexibil i ty .

        Yesterday, the Rules Committee approved the rule that would strip
the emergency funding mechanism from both bills. This regrettable action
will not help agencies move forward in addressing this problem. We note
that the Committee bill allocates funds from the emergency reserve for
Treasury and other agency Year 2000 (Y2K) needs.  If the emergency reserve
is not funded, the Congress will need to find other ways to fund
Treasury's critical Y2K needs.

        The value of the emergency mechanism approved by the House
Appropriations Committee is the flexibility it provides in the event that
we determine that additional resources are required. We have only 555
days until January 1, 2000. We want to solve this problem as soon as
possible. Delaying approval of emergency funding and reopening the issue
of the use of the emergency spending authority would create controversy
and delay. We hope that the House will reconsider.

Exchange Stabilization Fund

        The Administration has .serious concerns that an amendment to restrict
severely the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) may be
considered as part of the bill.   Such an amendment would constitute an


unacceptable ,limitation on the executive branchD,s ability to protect
critical u.s. economic interests. The Secretary of Treasury would
recommend a veto if the provision is included in the bill.

Federal Election Commission

        The Administration strongly objects to language included in the
bill that would,limit the term of the Federal Election Commission's staff
director and general counsel to four years and require a vote of four
commissioners to reappoint them.  This procedure is a departure from
current practice, established in statute, whereby the Commission appoints
a staff director and general counsel for an unlimited term. As with all
Commission decisions under current practice, removal of the staff director
and general counsel requires a vote' of four commissioners. The
Administration strongly urges the House to eliminate this unacceptable
provision from the bill.  Furthermore, because the provision effectively
could remove the current occupants of the positions, it would raise
serious constitutional questions under the separation of powers.

Executive Office of the President

        The Administration is strongly concerned with a number of
provisions related to the Executive Office of the President.  It is our
hope that any differences that exist concerning these provisions will be
resolved as the bill moves through the process.

Internal Revenue Service

        The Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s efforts to fund
the PresidentD,s budget request for the IRS.   However, if resources for
Y2K are struck from the bill,' IRS would be significantly underfunded.   We
look forward to working c~osely with the House to identify ways in which
full funding of the PresidentD,s request can be achieved.

         The Administration appreciates congressional support for IRS
information technology investments. However, tying obligation of funds to
GAO review of expenditure plans is objectionable since the Administration
has no control over the nature or timing of any prospective GAO review.

U.S. Customs Service

        The Administration is concerned about the funding level for
CustomsD, Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). Without major revisions
to the existing system, Customs cannot keep up with increasing trade
volumes nor can it be responsive to the requirements stated in the 1993
Modernization Act and the needs articulated by industry. The Committee
has funded only $8 million of the requested $56 million level, which would
cause the modernization effort to come v1rtually to a halt. To
accommodate the full amount requested, the Administration has proposed
funding the majority of ACE requirements through a user fee paid by those
who stand to benefit most from this system, the trade community.

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms

        The Administration appreciates the efforts of the Committee to
fully fund the President's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative
(YCGII). This initiative is an important part of the Administration's
overall strategy to curb youth gun violence. The Administration welcomes
an opportunity to report on the performance of the YCGII.


        The Administration requests reconsideration of the Violent Crime
Coordinator initiative, as the u.s. Attorneys have requested additional
ATF support for bringing cases involving violent criminals to the
Department of Justice for prosecution.

        We are pleased that the Committee shares the Administration's view
that relocation of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
headquarters staff remains a key concern due to inadequate security at
the present headquarters site. We hope that the Congress will continue to
consider funding for this priority when the review process is completed.

Federal Employees Health Benefits Program

        The Administration strongly opposes sections 514 and 515 of the
bill. These provisions would restrict Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program (FEHBP) coverage for abortions except in situations where the life
of the mother is endangered or the pregnancy is the result of rape or
incest. While the President believes that abortion should be safe, legal,
and rare, the Administration does not believe that Federal employees and
their families should be precluded from choosing to purchase health
insurance that includes broader coverage. The Administration believes
that the decision to cover abortion should be left to each health plan
participating in the
FEHBP. Thus, Federal employees who wish to purchase health coverage that
does not include abortion services would have that choice. The provision
in the Committee bill does not allow Federal employees and their families
to make that choice.

         The Administration supports the Committee reported provision
which requires coverage of prescription contraceptives by health plans
participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) and
would oppose an amendment to strike it. We support improvements in basic
health care coverage for women and the goal of the amendment -- to reduce
unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion.  However, the
Administration urges the Congress to give authority to the Office of
Personnel and Management to waive the requirement for plans that are
sponsored by organizations whose religious beliefs do not support
artificial methods of contraception.

        The rule under which the bill will be considered by the House makes in
order an amendment that would restrict the definition of contraceptives
to exclude any drug, device, or procedure "which has as one of its known
effects the interference with the implantation of a fertilized human ovum
or embryo." The Administration would strongly oppose such an amendment,
which could result in the denial of safe and legal contraceptive options
to Federal workers.  Further, such an amendment would interfere with physic
ian decision-making and communication with patients, as it may restrict
the ability of physicians to discuss such treatment options with patients.

Pay Raises

        The Administration shares the Committee's concern with· the current
system for setting and adjusting Federal pay. However, the potential
costs and programmatic disruptions should section 644 of the Committee
bill be enacted are significant. A Federal employee pay raise of about 15
percent would be automatically triggered in January 2000. Therefore, the
Administration urges that this provision be dropped.  Under the leadership
of the Office of Personnel Management, the Administration is working
expeditiously on a reform proposal and, as part of this process, will
consult with appropriate stakeholders, including the Congress.



        The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes a
proposal to eliminate the 1999 pay raise for Federal judges and employees
paid under the Executive Schedule.  Failure to provide pay raises for
senior executives is eroding the value of their pay, causing severe pay
compression in the executive ranks.  Pay adjustments have been made for
such individuals only once in the last five years.   If continued, this
failure will affect the GovernmentD,s ability to attract and retain the
executive talent that it needs. We urge the House to restore the pay
raise for Federal judges and the Executive Schedule.

Firefighter's Pay

        The Administration commends the Committee for including a
provision (section 639) in the bill'to reform the overtime pay system for
Federal firefighters.  A more rational, understandable, and uniform system
for calculating the overtime pay of Federal firefighters is long overdue.
The Committee provision would accomplish this important and much-needed
legislative change and reflects a consensus agreement among the various
stakeholders, such as affected executive branch agencies and employee
organizations.


United States Trade Representative

         The Administration opposes the provision that would make the U,S.
Trade Representative the United States representative to the Universal
Postal Union.  The U.S. Trade Representative lacks the resources and
expertise in postal administration to take on this responsibility.   In
addition, this provision would repeal the authority of the Postal Service
to establish international postage rates.   We urge that this provision be
dropped.

United States Postal Service

        The Administration is concerned that the Committee bill would
prohibit the Postal Service from initiating new non-postal commercial
activities or pack and send services. An appropriations bill should not
be used to legislate such restrictions on Postal Service operations.

 Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)

         The Administration appreciates the support the Committee has
provided for drug control efforts in general, and for ONDCP in
particular. The Administration encourages the House to provide the full
amount requested for the Special Forfeiture Fund as anything less would
adversely impact our ability to continue moving towards our mutual goal of
reducing drug use.   Failing to fully fund this request would negatively
impact the National Drug Control Strategy and our efforts to meet the
targets established in the Performance Measures of Effectiveness system.
The House could fund this spending, in part, by reducing amounts earmarked
by .the Committee for an unrequested technology transfer program.

Federal Buildings Fund

        The Committee has not provided $14 million requested for the
design of a new Department of Transportation (DOT) Headquarters.  Instead,
the Committee urges GSA to enter into a lease transaction, as authorized
by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee. The Administration requests that


the House provide funding for the design of a new DOT Headquarters.
Providing for a government-owned building would save taxpayers
approximately $190 million, in present value terms, compared to the cost
of entering into a lease.

        The Committee bill would delay the availability of funding until
September 30, 1999, for the repair and alterations program ($19 million)
and building operations program ($223 million).  The Administration is
concerned that a delay in obligations of this amount for buildings
operations would impede GSAD,s ability to operate and maintain Federal
facilities under its control.

        The Administration is also concerned that the Committee bill has
approved over $500 million for 15 unrequested courthouse construction
projects.

National Bioethics Advisory Commission

        The Administration objects to section 628 of the Committee bill,
which would prevent interagency funding of the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission. The work of the Commission affects at least 15 Federal
agencies. Access to interagency funding is essential for continued
operations of this small, but important commission.

Potential Amendment Related to Peer Review

        The Administration strongly opposes an amendment that may be offered
mandating'peer review of D&scientific dataD8 supporting final
regulations. The Administration is committed to using the best possible
science and peer review for rule-making.  However, this amendment is
unnecessary, inappropriate and wasteful.  Peer review is currently
incorporated in the Government-wide rule-making process where it is needed
through extensive outreach, public comment, and scientific advisory
boards.  This amendment as drafted mandates a one-size-fits-all
requirement that would serve only to delay important government action, in
particular, rules designed to protect health safety and the environment.
It would impose a costly additional step in the regulatory process and w
ould cover a large heterogeneous set of rules, as diverse as meat and
poultry inspection rules, airplane and automobile safety standards, FDA
drug and device approvals, and rules to ensure safe drinking water and
clean air.  This would impose an undue burden on numerous final rules by
requiring substantial personnel and other resources and could result in
significant delays on important public health and safety rules.

Bureau of Engraving and Printing

        The Administration objects to section 116 of the Committee bill,
which would prevent the Bureau of Engraving and Printing from awarding a
contract for currency paper under an ongoing competitive procurement
without prior congressional approval.  The Administration will interpret
such provisions to require notification only, since any other
interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ·ruling in INS vs. Chadha.
