                                          FOOD IRRADIATION
                                                  12/11/97



Q. What actions has the Administration done with regard to irradiation of food and why?

A.      Earlier this month the FDA approved irradiation of meat products for controlling
disease-causing micro-organisms. The approval applies to fresh and frozen red meats such as
beef. The USDA will soon publish a proposed implementing rule for companies that want to use
irradiation including requirements for appropriate labeling.

       FDA's approval was based on a scientific review of a substantial number of studies
conducted worldwide on the effects of irradiation on a wide variety of meat products. FDA
concluded that irradiation is safe in reducing disease-causing microbes in or on meats, and that it
does not compromise the nutritional quality of treated products. During the irradiation process,
food products are treated by subjecting them to radiation from radioactive or machine sources,
which kills significant numbers of insects, pathogenic bacteria and parasites. FDA's decision
does not require irradiation but simply permits it. The extent to which meat will be irradiated
depends on decisions made by the industry and consumers.

       Irradiation has previously been approved for products such as wheat, poultry, pork, fruits
and vegetables and spices. This approval was in response to a petition filed in August 1994 by a
company named Isomedix.

                         Questions and Answers on the Tobacco
                                   December 11, 1997



Q:   Do you see any signs that Congress will pass your comprehensive tobacco legislation?

A:   Yes. There are promising signs that Congress will come together in a bipartisan fashion
     and pass tobacco legislation in the upcoming year. Shortly after I announced my plan for
     the reduction of youth smoking we had a meeting with the leaders of both the House and
     the Senate on this issue -- Republicans and Democrats -- and the response was very
     positive. Protecting our children is a goal we can all agree on. Several Senators have
     introduced legislation, and there is a consensus that we have a unique opportunity if we
     act right now to control teen smoking.

     The Vice-President has been working hard building up support for the plan, he has held 3
     very successful public forums around the country. He is conducting a fourth forum next
     week, December 16th, in Seattle.

     Of course, this is a complicated issue. It needs to be studied carefully. But we have
     great hopes that the Administration and Congress can work together to enact bipartisan
     legislation in the near future.


Q:   Can you clarify the Administration's position on the money states have received from
     tobacco settlements. Are the states required to share that money with the federal .
     government?

A:   The states, particularly the state attorneys general, deserve enormous credit for their role
     in the fight against the tobacco companies. Along with some important work by the
     FDA and this Administration, they have made alot of progress. But current law is very
     clear on this subject, states are required to report to the Health Care Financing
     Administration reimbursements for Medicaid that may be part of any state tobacco
     settlements. I look forward to working with states and Congress to address this and other
     issues through tobacco 톖egislation. That legislation will involve a range of allocation
     questions we will resolve together. But to change the current requirement Congress must
     enact comprehensive tobacco legislation.


Q:   As the tobacco legislation moves through Congress, what are the elements you will not
     compromise on?

A:   When I announced my plan in September, I made clear that this was not about money, it


                                              1
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

      was about children, and keeping teenagers from smoking. I will not compromise on that.
       To get the level of smoking reduced, I proposed a plan with five key elements:

     A comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties if targets are not
      met, a public education and counter advertising campaign, and expanded efforts to restrict
      the access of youth to tobacco products;

     Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products;

     Changes in the way industry does business, including broad document disclosure;

     Progress toward other public health goals, including reduction of second-hand smoke,
      expansion of smoking cessation programs, strengthening of international efforts, and
      funding for health research and other health objectives; and

     Protection for tobacco farmers and their communities.

      I think we need these elements to have an effective plan.


Q:    What will happen if we fail to seize this opportunity?

A:    If current trends continue and nothing is done to curtail tobacco use in America, we can
      expect an additional 25 million painful and premature deaths among currently living
      Americans, including five million of our children. On average, smokers who die from
      smoking-related diseases will lose an average 12 years oflife, resulting in medical
      expenditures of $50 billion per year.


Q:.   Why has tobacco become such an important issue to this Administration?

A:    We've been working on this for two years now. Each day 3000 young people become
      regular smokers, replacing many of the adult smokers who have quit or died. As the
      20th century comes to a close, we need to "right our past wrongs" and bring to a close a
      century of neglect in dealing with the greatest preventable cause of death in our society.
      We need to protect our children from being seduced, and then addicted, and finally
      afflicted. We need to enter the 21st century with policies and programs in place which
      treat tobacco commensurate with the harm that it causes.
