ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

Religious Leaders Forum. On June 1, the Reverend Dr. Suzan D. Johnson Cook hosted the
Religious Leaders Forum in Louisville, KY. Reverend Tony Campo10 gave a rousing keynote
address, and DOJ Director of Community Relations Service Rose Ochi moderated one of the
panels. Approximately 100 people attended and participated in small breakout discussions.
Numerous ideas were elicited and many people indicated a renewed commitment to racial
reconciliation activities in Louisville and the surrounding area.

United South and Eastern Tribes. On June 3, Governor William Winter, senior Initiative
staff and I participated in a panel discussion in Nashville, Tennessee with the United South and
Eastern Tribes. During our two-hour panel, we heard directly from the Tribal leaders, as well as
other Tribal government officials, on a variety of topics. Major issues included the concern
that Indian people did not want to be assimilated into one America, the importance of the
Initiative valuing the government-to-government relationship between the Tribes and the Federal
government, the need to protect the cultural heritage of Indian people, and the need to protect
sacred sites and a consistent federal policy on such protection.

American Bar Association. On June 4, Angela Oh discussed the importance of racial
reconciliation at an American Bar Association planning meeting for their 1999 National
Conference on Race Relations.

New Jersey Region National Conference. On May 28, Governor Kean spoke at this

conference on the Initiative to an audience of 100 composed of staff, administration and board
members from a number of school districts.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

June Advisory Board Meeting. We continue to plan the June Advisory Board meeting,
scheduled for June 18 in Washington, D.C. Before the June 18 meeting, some Advisory Board
members will meet as subgroups for internal discussions focusing on issues such as education,
economic development, leadership, and a vision for one America. The Advisory Board
members will be able to use the subgroup meetings as opportunities to review progress made
to-date and develop ideas to promote continuing support for work started during the Initiative
year. On June 18, the full Advisory Board will meet publicly to present issues and ideas for
deliberation and consideration.

One Year Anniversary. We have prepared summaries ofInitiative accomplishments and
questions and answers in anticipation of press inquiries on the occasion of the one year
anniversary of your June 1997 San Diego speech launching the Initiative. These documents
were distributed to Advisory Board members and White House staff. In addition, Dr. Franklin
has written an op-ed about the Initiative which we will send to several major news magazines to
coincide with the one year anniversary.

Prayer for Racial Reconciliation. We sent letters to participants in the New Orleans and
Louisville Religious Leaders Forums and other religious leaders asking them, during the
weekend of June 12-14, to recognize the anniversary of the announcement of the Initiative, offer·
a prayer for racial reconciliation during their worship service, and plan other activities to
reinforce the message of racial reconciliation.

Brooklyn Unity Awards. On June 2, Deputy Director for Outreach, Mike Wenger, delivered
the keynote address at the 10th Annual Brooklyn Unity Awards Ceremony in Brooklyn, NY.
Over 100 people attended the event sponsored by Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden,
who presented awards to four programs in Brooklyn which are bringing people, young and old,
together across racial lines.

Fact Book. Initiative staff met with the Council of Economic Advisors and the White House
Communications Office this week to discuss the final stages of preparation for the Race Fact
Book that CEA is preparing for the Initiative. The report is expected to be released in
September.

on how to conduct a discussion on race is available on the website in two forms. One format is
easily viewed while visiting the site, and the other enables visitors to print the guide in its
original format.
