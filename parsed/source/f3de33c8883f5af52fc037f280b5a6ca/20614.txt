TEXT:


Please review the House L/HHS/Ed letter. Markup is tomorrow, Tuesday, at
1pm; therefore, we need your comments by lOam. Thank you.

The Honorable Bob Livingston
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the AdministrationD,s
views on the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related
Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House
Subcommittee. As the Committee develops its version of the bill, your
consideration of the AdministrationD,s views would be appreciated.

        [On June 23, 199B, the President stated that he was D&deeply disappointed
with the Subcommittee bill.DB Due to the very serious funding and
language issues present in the Subcommittee bill, discussed below, the
President would veto the bill in its current form.]

        .The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to
offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.   The
PresidentD,s FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
through user fees and certain mandatory programs to help finance this
spending.   In the recently enacted Transportation Equity Act, Congress --
on a broad, bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding
for surface transportation programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We
want to work with the Congress on mutually-agreeable mandatory and other
offsets that could be used to increase funding for high-priority
discretionary programs, including those funded by this bill.   ~n addition,
we hope that the Committee will reduce funding for lower priority
discretionary programs, and redirect funding to programs of higher
priority.

Department of Education

         The Subcommittee bill cuts $2 billion from the PresidentD,s
overall request for education program funding.   As a result, the bill does
not adequately support the Nation's efforts to raise student achievement,
make schools safe, and improve the capabilities of teachers.   High
priority programs inadequately funded and objectionable language issues
include:

  Goals 2000.  Funding for Goals 2000 is cut $255 million below the
President's request, which would reverse momentum in all 50 States to
raise academic standards and deny 6,000 schools serving over three million
students the funds needed to implement innovative education reforms.

 Title I (Education for the Disadvantaged) Grants to Local Educational
Agencies. The Subcommittee bill cuts $392 million from the request, which
would leave nearly 520,000 students in high-poverty communities without
the extra help they need to master the basics and develop the capability
to reach high academic standards.

 Eisenhower Professional Development.  The SubcommitteeD,s $50 million
reduction would leave over 100,000 teachers without the training they need
to help them teach to rigorous academic standards.



 America Reads. America Reads is denied the $210 million provided in last
year's Bipartisan Budget Agreement for children's literacy, which would
prevent thousands of young children from receiving the extra help they
need to learn to read well and independently by the end of the third grade.

 Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities. The SubcommitteeO,s $50
million reduction would deny funding for School Coordinators in nearly
one-half of the Nation's middle schools needed to implement effective drug
and violence prevention programs.

 After School programs (21st Century Community Learning Centers). A $140
million cut to this program, part of the PresidentD,s child care
initiative, would result in 3,000 fewer centers and no services to nearly
400,000 children.

 Education Opportunity Zones. The Subcommittee bill does not provide the
requested $200 million, which would deny high-poverty urban and rural
districts the extra assistance they need to implement effective reforms
with tough accountability for performance.

 Technology in Education. The SubcommitteeD,s $137 million reduction from
the request would make it increasingly difficult for States to meet school
children'S education technology needs, especially in training teachers to
integrate educational technology into their curriculum effectively.

 School-to-Work. School-to-Work is cut by a total of $100 million
(between the Departments of Education and Labor) below the President's
$250 million request, which would seriously hamper all States' efforts to
help young people of all backgrounds move from high school to car~ers or
postsecondary training and education.

 Work-Study. Roughly 57,000 needy students would be denied the
opportunity to work to finance their college education because of the
SubcommitteeD,s $50 million reduction.

 Higher Education Initiatives. No funds are provided for three
Presidential initiatives for which the President sought $237 million: High
Hopes, to help prepare students at high poverty middle schools for
college; Learning Anytime Anywhere Partnership grants for pilot projects
using distance learning technology; and teacher recruitment and
preparation programs. In addition to inadequate funding for priority
education programs, the Administration is concerned with several language
provisions of the Subcommittee bill, that would severely restrict the
AdministrationD,s ability to continue the development of programs designed
to raise academic standards.

  National Tests. The Administration strongly objects to the language
.limitation and $15 million funding cut that would bring a halt to the
President's efforts to help States and parents raise academic standards
through a voluntary national test. The Subcommittee billD,s language
would prohibit the development, implementation, and administration of the
tests unless explicitly authorized. The language prohibition should be
deleted and the funding restored.

 Unfocused Block Grants. The Administration strongly objects to language
that would, in effect, turn the Goals 2000 and the Eisenhower Professional
Development programs into block grants by allowing those funds to be used
under the broad Title VI block grant authority. Title VI has no
performance or accountability standards. The language should be deleted


so that these Federal funds can address national needs and continue to be
guided by strong accountability measures.

 Special Education (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act -- IDEA).
The bill contains two objectionable IDEA riders.   One would undermine the
due process protections and parental rights for disabled students who are
regarded as violent. The other would, in effect, allow States to
discontinue special education services for youth ages 18-21 in adult
prisons, violating the right of all disabled, incarcerated students in
that age group to receive special education services and prohibiting the
Department of Education from using its enforcement mechanisms.  Both
provisions would unnecessarily re-open IDEA before last year's bipartisan
reauthorization has had a chance to be implemented and fairly assessed.
Both provisions should be stricken.

 Bilingual Education. While we agree with the Committee on the need for
more reforms to Bilingual Education, we are opposed to any provision that
would set an absolute limit on student participation in bilingual
education or
alternative programs.  Such a step would deny help to students who need it
and
violate the civil rights of Limited English Proficient students to an
equal
education. Because of individual differences, students will vary in how
long it
takes to develop English proficiency. We are also opposed to provisions
that
would establish a two year goal for becoming proficient in English, since
research has shown that this timetable is unrealistically short. There
are several
promising provisions in this proposed bill, such as the removal of the 25
percent cap to allow more local flexibility and the funding priority for
only
successful programs.

Department·of Labor

        Summer Jobs Program. The Administration strongly opposes the
SubcommitteeD,s elimination of the $871 million Summer Jobs program, which
could finance 530,000 summer jobs for economically disadvantaged youth.
The unemployment rate for teens continues to far exceed the overall
unemployment rate.  The Summer Jobs program plays a vital role in
supporting employment among these teens, especially among African-American
youths -- approximately 25 percent of summer jobs held by African-American
14-15 year olds come through this program -- and serves as a valuable
introduction to the world of work. We urge the Committee to restore the
full request for this program.

        PresidentD,s Youth Opportunity Area Initiative. The Subcommittee
provides no funding for the PresidentD,s Youth Opportunity Area initiative
and rescinds the $250 million appropriated last year for this program.
This program would address the problem of pervasive joblessness in
high-poverty neighborhoods by making large investments in these areas to
effect community-wide change and help 50,000 out-of-school youth.  We
strongly oppose elimination
of this program, which is an essential component of the AdministrationD,s
Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities initiative. We urge the
Committee to provide full funding as requested.

       The Administration has strong concerns with the inadequate funding


    levels provided for the following Labor programs:

     Adult Job Training. The Subcommittee has provided none of the requested
    increases for the Dislocated Worker ($100 million) and low-income adult
    ($45 million) job training programs.  Freezing these programs would mean
    that some 67,000 fewer workers in need of assistance would be helped.

     Worker Protection. The Subcommittee has cut nearly in half the requested
    increase for programs that protect our workers on the job.  For example,
    the Subcommittee mark for Occupational Safety and Health Administration
    redirects resources to State consultation and is, effectively, 12-percent
    below the requested level for Federal enforcement, while funding for the
    Mine Safety and Health Administration is frozen at the 1998 level. We
    urge the Committee to restore financing for such critical workplace
    protection programs.

     Unemployment Insurance. The House Subcommittee mark does not fund the
    $90 million requested for the Unemployment Insurance (UI) integrity
    initiative. This initiative was authorized in the Balanced Budget Act of
    1997 and would, over five years, achieve $763 million in mandatory savings
    assumed in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement.  Failure to fund this
    initiative would mean a continuation of errors in benefit payments and UI
    taxes.

     Child Labor. The $3 million increase to combat international child labor
    abuses is inadequate in light of the magnitude of the problem, and
    provides only a small fracti~n of the $27 million requested.

            The Subcommittee bill contains several objectionable language
    riders addressing regulatory issues in the Department of Labor. These
    include language imposing new, unnecessary, and burdensome review
    procedures before the Department can issue Black Lung regulations, a new
    requirement for OSHA to conduct duplicative peer review panels for its new
    regulations, and a continuation of the rider that prohibits MSHA from
    enforcing training requirements at certain mines, which have a growing
    numbers of deaths. These riders would make it more difficult for the
    Department of Labor to carry out its programs and should be dropped.

           The Administration objects to the continuation of last year'
