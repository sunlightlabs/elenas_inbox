TEXT:
At long last, please find attached the latest action memo to be prepared
for POTUS regarding the bioterrorism provisions in the Omnibus Crime
Bill. Although everyone has received the background information,
including the latest bill language as agreed upon by HHS and DOJ and the
1-2 pagers submitted by each, I have them in my office if you would like
another copy.

To move this along please:
make comments or changes using "tracking changes" in WORD so that I know
which office has provided comments
please provide a comprehensive submission from your agency.  I have
already received two comments from one org that were quite frankly at odds
with one other.
Since there aren't significant changes from the previous drafts, I would
like comments by COB Tuesday.
I sent OSTP, NSC Legal and OVP their copies through classified LAN system.

Let me know if you need anything. Thanks very much.==================== ATTACHMENT

SUBJECT:        Proposed Biological Terrorism Provisions in the
                Omnibus Crime Bill


Purpose

To determine the Administration position on proposed biological
terrorism provisions in the Omnibus Crime Bill.

Background

There is consensus within the Administration that serious gaps
exist in federal bioterrorism laws.  In contrast to chemical,
nuclear or radiological weapons, there are currently few laws in
place designed to limit the availability of biological weapons
to the general public. Current laws are merely suited to
punishing perpetrators after they unleash biological warfare
agents, not keeping these substances out of the wrong hands in
the first place. Therefore, there is interagency agreement that
the proposed Omnibus Crime Bill would include new provisions
establishing criminal penalties for:

   possession of harmful biological agents not justified by a
    peaceful purpose.  Justification would be determined by type
    and/or quantity of the agent.

   Unsafe handling of harmful biological agents.  This provision
    holds persons accountable who handle such agents with
    conscious disregard for public health and safety and in a
    manner that grossly deviates from acceptable-norms.


                                                            cc: Vice President
                                                                Chief of Staff
                                 2            Hex-Dilmp Con\'ersion

   unregistered possession and unauthorized transfer of selected
    biological agents. This provision recognizes that authorities
    should be aware of who is handling the most deadly biological
    agents and is a logical extension of current Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) transfer regulations.
    Any additional reporting burden will be minimal for scientific
    facilities that already comply with CDC transfer regulations.
    You would have 60 days after this legislation comes into
    effect to designate the agency that would be responsible for
    the registration process.

   Knowingly perpetrating a hoax regarding the use of harmful
    biological agents. Necessary given the recent spate of such
    hoaxes as the rash of anthrax scares around the United States.


There is interagency disagreement, however, on one remaining
issue. Janet Reno supports including far-reaching bioterrorism
provisions in the Omnibus Crime Bill; Donna Shalala would scale
back the proposal due to concerns that some of the provisions
would overburden the legitimate medical research community.

Justice Option.  Justice's draft Omnibus Crime Bill further
proposes that criminal penalties be established for:

   Possession of select biological agents by a restricted
    individual. This provision recognizes that factors such as a
    felony record, past mental impairment, or illegal alien status
    raise significant questions regarding the suitability to
    possess deadly biological agents.  However, immediate waivers
    are permitted in certain circumstances.

Justice notes that bioterrorism is a growing concern in Congress
and that many on both sides of the aisle will be watching to see
if the Administration will produce a draft bill with a strong
law enforcement focus before introducing their own proposals.
Justice believes that its proposed provisions will provide law
enforcement with critical tools to prevent a bioterrorism
catastrophe, while only being minimally intrusive on the
legitimate research community.  The proposed legislation does
not criminalize the actions of persons within the scientific
community, except where their conduct so deviates from accepted
safety standards as to be reckless or where it involves
complicity in sharing lethal agents with persons known to be
barred from possessing such agents.  Even with these precautio~s
in place, Justice has agreed to a HHS proposal to accompany the
submission of this legislation with a statement to Congress



                                       3    Automated Records Management System
                                                   Hex-DiJmp Conversion

     indicating that we will review the bill's provisions with
     responsible representatives of the scientific community over a
     60 day period, after which the Administration would advise
     Congress of any changes found to be appropriate.  The Justice
     Option is supported by NSC.

     HHS Option.  HHS believes the provisions in the Justice Option
     would chill vital scientific endeavors and instead recommends
     that:

        A Presidential deadline be set for consultations with the
         scientific community to propose measures to address the
         training of scientists, safe procedures for handling, storage
         and security of biocontaminants, civil fines and penalties,
         and to consider what personal characteristics or events in an
         individual's history could legitimately support exclusion from
         research on select agents.

     HHS also objects to criminal liability for employers who employ
     individuals with certain characteristics or histories because
     the limiting factors 'will cover minor transgressions that are
     unlikely to be associated with terrorist proclivities.   For
     instance, addiction to controlled substances, which could
     include prescription medicines and commitment to a mental
     institution,which could include treatment for simple
     depression.  The Justice provision allows for exceptions in
     limited circumstances, for example in certain cases where the
     disqualifying event is more than five years old and the employer
     makes a written determination that the employee is suitable or
     if the employee is a lawful, non-permanent resident alien, the
     employee receives a waiver from an agency designated by you.
     Nonetheless, HHS believes that in practice employers would not
     be willing to accept the risk of employing individuals even if
     one of the exceptions applies, and therefore qualified
     scientists will be effectively excluded from the profession.
     The HHS Option is supported by OSTP.

     RECOMMENDATION

     That you decide between the two options above.

                      Justice Option


                      HHS Option
