I.    PURPOSE

      You will be participating in the cornerstone dedication for the Dale and Betty Bumpers
      Vaccine Research Center, under construction on the campus of the NIH.

II.   BACKGROUND

      In May of 1987, you announced your desire to find a vaccine for HIV within ten years.
      The NIH, as the lead biomedical research agency, has responded to your challenge by
      increasing intramural and extramural research efforts. Part of its response is a new
      vaccine research center. Initially, the work of this center will focus almost entirely on
      AIDS vaccine research, coordinating intramural research with extramural and private
      research here and abroad.

      In the 11999 Omnibus Appropriations Ac~,. ,C,ollgress, ,inc,lud,e<i,a, d,edi,cati~n, ()f,this, ,ne,\\, , ,   "," { Comment (El]: Chock n.m.
      vaccine research center to Dale and Betty Bumpers. While both champions of
      biomedical research, Mrs. Bumpers has been particularly active in promoting the
      development of childhood vaccines.

         A new center director. After a lengthy search, the NIH recently announced a new
          director for the center, Dr. Gary Nabel. In a statement released this past March,
          you praised the selection of Dr. Nabel and noted that his long and distinguished
          career as a research scientist will be an incredible asset in our efforts to find
          preventative vaccines.


         Funding for vaccine research. On World AIDS Day (December I, 1998), you




                                                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
               $200 million). More modest increases are proposed for FY2000. Overall funding
               requests for AIDS vaccine research at the Department of Defense have remained
               steady at about $24 million per year but appropriations declined by 37%--from $38
               million in FY 1998 to $24 million in FY I 999--(a Congressional supporter with a
               history of adding funds to this line item was unsuccessful in sustaining that increase
               for FY 1999).

              Research coordination. NIH coordinates its efforts with other Federal agencies,
               including the Department of Defense, the US Agency for International Development,
               the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and
               Prevention, and the Department of State. In addition, NIH is working with
               international organizations and scientists from around the world to coordinate
               research efforts and prepare for clinical trials.

              The global AI DS pandemic. Since HIV was first identified in the 1970s, over 47
               million people have been infected of whom 14 million have died. The World Health
               Organization just announced that AIDS is the fourth leading killer in the world, and is
               the leading killer in Africa. It now claims many more lives each year than malaria, a
               growing menace, and is still nowhere near its peak. If India, China and other Asian
               countries do not take it seriously, the number of infections could reach "a new order
               of magnitude," says Peter Piot, head of the UN's AIDS program.

              Vaccine is our best hope. While HIV prevention activities have proven effective-
               when supported by leadership and funding-the development of an AIDS vaccine
               remains our best hope of stopping the pandemic. To be successful, we will need both
               a safe, effective, economical, and easily administered vaccine and the infrastructure
               necessary for deployment. This will require both enhanced support from the
               developed nations and partnerships with private industry, international organizations,
               and impacted countries. Your leadership on this issue continues to energize
               international efforts and fuels the beacon of hope for an end to this crisis.
