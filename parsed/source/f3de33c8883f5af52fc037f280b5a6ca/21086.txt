Event Update: As of this afternoon, the speaking program looks long,
primarily due to the number of electeds who want to participate. The
feeling in the communications meeting was that in this instance, longer
might actually be better. The order hasn't yet been worked out, except for
the Mayor who will open, and the parent/teacher who will introduce the
President. Here's what it looks like so far:

Speaking Program
1. Worcester Mayor Raymond Moriano
2.  Representative McGovern
3. Worcester Police Chief Ed Gardella*
4.  Senator Kennedy
5. Lt. Governor Kathleen Kennedy-Townsend*
6.  Police Corps Grad*
7. Teacher/Parent
8.  POTUS

As of tonight, Kennedy-Townsend is an unlikely, and Senator Kerry is very
unlikely.   Between the Police Chief and the Police Corps grad, one may get
pulled.   I would prefer to have the chief, since he is a really strong
supporter -- but the Police Corps grad would be good too.   Everyone except
for the parent/teacher (teacher who is hopefully also a parent)   has been
identified and is available. Mike is working with NEA to get a teacher,
and leg affairs is working with McGovern on it too.

With regard to the site, they have selected Mechanics Hall, otherwise
known as the Great Hall in Worcester. They are trying to get about 1,300
people at the event -- which I figure to be almost 10% of the city
population!

Paper:  I've attached a revised one-pager on the event. Gore's folks
asked to include the bullet on his school safety event in California.   I
will be forwarding Q&A and the briefing tomorrow.

I think we will be reviewing the speaking program in the morning. Let me
know if you have any questions or thoughts on any part of this.

Thanks.

                                  Keeping Our Schools and Streets Safe
                                           August 27,1998

In Worcester, today President Clinton will make announcements to support law enforcement and help
make our schools safer. He will announce: (1) the release by the Departments of Justice and Education of
an Early Warning Guide for teachers and principals to help identify and respond to violence in schools;
and (2) the availability of $30 million for states to provide college scholarships to aspiring law enforcement
officers in return for a commitment of service.

Helping Schools Prevent and Respond to Violence

       Giving teachers and principals needed tools. Schools are among the safest places our children can
        be. Nonetheless, last year's tragic and sudden acts of violence in a number of schools remind us
        that no community can afford to be complacent when it comes to protecting its children. In
        response to the tragic loss of life and injuries at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, in
        his June 13 radio address, President Clinton directed the Secretary of Education and the Attorney
        General to develop a guide to help teachers, principals, and parents respond to the early warning
        signs of troubled youth that can lead to school violence.

        Today, the guide wil be posted on the Education Department Website, and on September 1, a copy
        will be sent to every school in the country. The guide, based on research and experience in schools
        around the country, gives school communities information on how to:

                (1) Identify the early warning signs that relate to violence and other behaviors, including a
                list of specific signs to look for in troubled youth, such as: uncontrolled anger; patterns of
                impulsive and chronic hitting, intimidating, and bullying; detailed and specific threats to
                use violence; gang affiliations; feelings of persecution; and past history of violent and
                aggressive behaviors such as cruelty to animals or fire setting. Trained staff can use these
                early warning signs, together with knowledge about students and their circumstances, to
                determine when to seek help for individual students and to prevent violence.

                (2) Take action steps to prevent violence. intervene and get help for troubled children, and
                respond to school violence when it is imminent or has occurred. The guide instructs
                schools how to develop a violence prevention and response plan and form a school-based
                team to oversee the plan's implementation. It provides a crisis procedure checklist, a
                step-by-step plan to follow once sudden violence occurs. The guide also lists actions
                students can take -- such as listening to troubled friends, involving trusted adults, and
                asking law enforcement to conduct school safety audits -- to help create safer schools.

       Talking to communities about school safety. Today in San Francisco, Vice President and Mrs.
        Gore will visit Lincoln High School and hold a listening session on school safety with parents,
        local law enforcement, and community leaders and discuss the steps we can all take to make our
        schools safer and our children more secure. This session, and others held by administration
        officials around the country, will help the President and Vice President to prepare for the
        upcoming White House Conference on School Safety this October 15th.



Advancing the Education and Training o(New Community Police Officers
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


   Police Corps: scholarships for service. The President will announce the availability of a total of
    $30 million for 23 states to encourage young people to become law enforcement officers through
    college scholarships. The Police Corps provides educational assistance of up to $7,500 per year
    for four years for students who agree to serve on a state or local police force for an equal length of
    time. Police Corps also provides policing agencies $10,000 per participant for each year of
    required service.

   Expanding Police Corps to 23 states. Six new states will participate in Police Corps and will
    receive $14.3 million to award scholarships for 330 students -- which will bring the total number
    of students funded by Police Corps to over 1,000. The remaining funds will support the ongoing
    expenses of Police Corps participants already approved to date. In all, 23 states will participate in
    Police Corps: AR, CO, CN, FL, GA, IN, IL, KY, MA, MD, MI, MS, MO, NY, NM, NC, OH, OR,
    OK, SC, TX, UT, W A and the Virgin Islands.
