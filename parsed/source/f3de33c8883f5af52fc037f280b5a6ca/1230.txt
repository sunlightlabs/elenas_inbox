                         AFSCME CONCERNS ABOUT MEDICAID


Background

There is almost nothing about the Medicaid policy in the President's budget that AFSCME
supports. They are opposed' to having any Medicaid savings, arguing that recent downward
baseline adjustments mitigate the need for further deficit reduction contributions by Medicaid.
They oppose how we achieve the savings, arguing that a per capita cap could hurt vulnerable
populations and that cuts in disproportionate share (DSH) payments will hurt public hospitals,
the patients they serve, and the employees who work in the institutions. And finally, they are
extremely uncomfortable with providing more administrative flexibility to the states, publicly
arguing that it will subject beneficiaries to substandard care and reductions in access, and
privately worrying that states will contract out with non-union employees to administer
Medicaid.

At this time, there is nothing we can do relative to AFSCME's concerns about how we achieve
our savings. Our budget is now public and we certainly cannot run away from the per capita cap
and the DSH savings proposals. Although they will grumble about our savings policy,
AFSCME understands we cannot modify it at this stage in the process. Instead, they are
focusing on two issues that they believe we can address: (I) the allocation ofDSH savings and
(2) our yet to be submitted state flexibility language, particularly as it relates to personnel
requirements.

(1)    DSH Allocationffargeting. AFSCME and the public hospitals agree that there may be
       limited savings in DSH, but only if it is combined with much better targeting of DSH
       dollars to the hospitals they say are providing care to the greatest numbers of uninsured,
       underinsured and high cost Medicaid patients -- the public hospitals. While most of the
       players (the private hospitals, public hospitals, physicians, the unions, consumer groups,
       and even some states) all acknowledge there could be better targeting, no one agrees on
       how best to do it. It is for this reason that we chose to punt on this issue, saying that we
       wanted to work with interested parties on how best to design an improved allocation
       formula. Consistent with that, we have already held meetings in the last week and a half
       with both the unions <\I1d the public hospitals, and we plan do to more.

       Talking Points:

              I understand your concerns about both the size of the DSH cut and the need
               for better targeting of these dollars. We agree that we need to find ways to
               better target dollars, but -- as you know -- the devil is in the details.

              We did not release a specific, new targeting formula because we thought it
               would more likely hurt, rather than help, the chances of reforming the
               current allocation approach. If we went ahead with almost anything, the
               states and many hospitals would have used up all of their energy killing it,
               rather than working together to find consensus on this difficult issue.

              We have held some constructive preliminary meetings with your policy
               experts on this issue, and we plan on doing more. Let's keep talking to see if
                     Hex-Dump Conversion
              we can come up with something we both can agree on.
(2)   State flexibility/personnel requirement issues. AFSCME is particularly concerned
      about two provisions in our Medicaid flexibility proposal: (A) the elimination of the
      waiver process for managed care and (B) the relaxation of certain personnel requirements
      for the Medicaid program.

      (A) AFSCME opposes the elimination of the managed care waiver process. They like it
      because they feel it gives them time to weigh in on issues they are concerned about, thus
      giving them the opportunity to push the Department to make changes before final
      approval. The truth is that neither the current waiver process nor the proposed state plan
      amendment process that will replace it affords much opportunity for the unions to
      influence the actions of the Department. What remains the same, though, is the
      Department's authority to not grant, or subsequently repeal, the authority to implement a
      managed care program. Moreover, although the time-consuming waiver process would
      be repealed under our proposal, we are going to include new language that would assure
      that quality standards are being met by managed care plans.

      (B) AFSCME is significantly concerned about our provisions to relax personnel
      requirements on state Medicaid programs. They charge that such changes will
      undermine quality and, at least as important to AFSCME, potentially lead to further
      reductions in force in Medicaid programs around the country. They believe, for
      example, that allowing non-government employees to do eligibility may create conflict of
      interest problems for companies who are also overseeing managed care plans.

      Unlike the new welfare law, our current Medicaid language does not allow states to
      completely privatize the administration of the program. It does, however, repeal the
      requirement that states use Federal merit protection systems when hiring personnel.
      The unions are satisfied that we are not talking about a welfare law type approach, but
      extremely concerned that the merit protections repeal will open up the door to going
      down that road. The Administration is stilI trying to determine exactly how we want to
      interpret both current welfare law (e.g., food stamps) and our new Medicaid proposal,
      particularly on the issue of whether private personnel can determine eligibility. We have
      an interagency/OMBIDPC working group finalizing our position in these issues.

      Talking Points:

            I understand your concerns about the Medicaid flexibility provisions. We
             want to work with you on these important issues.

            While we cannot back-track on our position on the elimination of the waiver
             process, we do want to work with you to assure that appropriate quality
             standards are in place. When we send up the statutory language, you will
             see that we are improving our Medicaid quality provisions.

            We understand your concerns about the merit system protections. We are
             working hard to develop a workable, realistic approach to administering
             Medicaid that assure a high quality program. I know you have met with
             Donna Shalala on this issue and I believe we should continue our
             conversations so there are no surprises.
