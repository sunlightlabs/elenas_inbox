The House Ways and Means Committee has failed to restore a minimal safety net for disabled
legal immigrants. The bipartisan budget agreement provides funds to restore SSI and Medicaid
benefits to any legal immigrant in the U.S. prior to August 23, 1996 who is or becomes disabled
-- but the House Ways and Means Committee proposes only to grandfather benefits for those
immigrants already receiving benefits when the welfare law was signed.

      THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE PROPOSAL IGNORES
       VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS WHO BECOME DISABLED AFTER AUGUST
       23,1996: This proposal abandons many legal immigrants who were in the U.S. when
       the welfare law was signed but become severely disabled after that date. In contrast, the
       bipartisan budget agreement protects these immigrants -- targeting assistance to those
       vulnerable individuals who need it most.

      BY THE YEAR 2002, THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE PROPOSAL
       WOULD PROTECT 75,000 FEWER IMMIGRANTS THAN THE BUDGET
       AGREEMENT. This number grows to 125,000 by the year 2007.

      DISABLED LEGAL IMMIGRANTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RELY ON THEIR
       SPONSORS FOR HELP. Since sponsorship agreements were not legally binding in
       the past, a disabled legal immigrant whose sponsor refuses to provide support has no
       legal recourse and no source of income. Or a sponsor may not be able to afford to
       support a severely disabled individual. A disabled legal immigrant who has been in the
       U.S. for many years may have lost touch with or be unable to locate his or her sponsor.

      NATIONAL GROUPS REPRESENTING THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH
       DISABILITIES ARE UNITED IN THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS PROPOSAL.
       They recognize that the budget agreement would protect more disabled elderly and
       non-elderly people than the House Ways and Means proposal.

      THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS PROPOSAL IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH
       THE BUDGET AGREEMENT. Negotiators found a way to assist these individuals
       within the context of a balanced budget. Now the House Ways and Means Committee is
       trying to unravel that agreement and failing to restore a minimal safety net for disabled
       legal immigrants.

      WHILE BETTER THAN THE HOUSE APPROACH, THE SENATE FINANCE
       COMMITTEE ALSO FALLS SHORT OF THE MARK. The Senate Finance
       Committee would allow disabled legal immigrants to apply for benefits for a short
       period of time but would then shut the door to legal immigrants who become
       disabled. Immigrants who become disabled after this. arbitrary grace period would
       be ineligible, just as in the House Ways and Means proposal.

       Example: A legal immigrant family entered the country 3 years ago. Both parents work
       full-time, earning $25,000 a year at jobs that don't provide health insurance. Next year,
       their 5 year-old son becomes severely disabled in a car accident. Under the budget
       agreement, he would be eligible for SSI and Medicaid; but under the House Ways and
       Means and Senate Finance proposals he would be denied ~6.!h)~im~~itt~em
