S. 2176 - Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998
(Sen. Thompson (R) TN and 6 cosponsors)

The Administration cannot support S. 2176 in its present form.  If the
bill is not amended to address the AdministrationD,s concerns, the
PresidentD,s senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.   S.
2176 would revise the process set forth in the vacancies Act for filling
vacancies in positions that are subject to Presidential appointment and
Senate confirmation.

While certain provisions of S. 2176 are acceptable, several others are
extremely problematic.  In particular, the bill would (1) too narrowly
limit who can serve in an D&actingD8 capacity;
(2) jeopardize critical duties pertaining to national security, criminal
law enforcement, public health and safety, and the stability of financial
markets; and (3) provide insufficient time to fill positions at the
beginning of an Administration.

The Administration understands the SenateD,s genuine interest in passing
legislation in this area and would be willing to support a fair and
workable bill. The Administration cannot, however, support a bill that
would have a severe and damaging impact on the governmentD,s ability to do
the peopleD,s business.

*       *     *      *     *

    (Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

This Statement of Administration policy was developed by the Legislative
Reference Division (Elmore) in consultation with VAPD (***),

*** (***) and *** (***) concur with this position.     The following agencies
have no objection:  *** have no comment.

OMB/LA Clearance:

S. 2176 was introduced on June 16, 1998.  On June 17, 1998, the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee amended S. 2176 and ordered it reported.
This position is based on Senate Report 105-250.

Administration position to Date

On July 28, 1998, the White House Chief of Staff transmitted a letter to
Senator Lott in which he expressed that the Administration cannot support
S. 2176 in its present form and indicated that, if the bill is not amended
to address the AdministrationD,s concerns, the PresidentD,s senior
advisers would recommend that he veto it.  In addition, several agencies
have responded to questions from Senator Glenn regarding the billO,s
expected effects on their respective agencies.  In these letters, the
agencies have almost uniformly expressed their strong opposition to the
bill and have referred to the senior advisersD, veto threat.

Summary of S. 2176

S. 2176 would provide that upon the death, resignation, or inability to
serve of an officer of an Executive agency (including the Executive Office
of the President and other than the General Accounting Office), the first
assistant to the officer would become the acting officer, for a period


beginning on the date the vacancy occurs and not to exceed 150 days.
 (Currently, the acting officer may serve for 120 days.)  As an alternative
to this arrangement, the President would be able to direct that a person wh
o has already received Senate confirmation could be made the acting
officer in lieu of the first assistant.   The bill also would require that
a first assistant who has not received Senate confirmation, but who is
nominated to fill the office permanently, could be made the acting officer
only if he or she has been the first assistant for at least 180 days in
the year preceding the vacancy.   If a first or second nominee were
withdrawn, or rejected or returned by the Senate, the acting official
would be able to serve until 150 days after the withdrawal, rejection, or
return of that nomination.

S. 2176 would apply to most vacancies in Senate-confirmed positions in
Executive agencies, but there would be a few exceptions.   First, those
laws that expressly provide that they supersede the Vacancies Act would do
so.  Second, current laws (numbering approximately 41) that provide for
the President or the head of an Executive department to designate an
officer t·o perform the functions and duties of a specified office in· an
acting capacity would be maintained, as would those statutes that
themselves stipulate who shall serve in a specific office in an acting
capacity.   Statutes that only generally permit agency heads to delegate or
reassign duties within their agencies would be specified not to constitute
statutes that provide for the temporary filling of particular offices.

S. 2176 contains an enforcement provision.   The provision would require
that an office be made vacant if, 150 days after the vacancy arises, the
President has not submitted a nominee to the Senate.   In such a cases, for
offices other than the heads of agencies, the functions and duties
specifically to be performed by the vacant officer would be required to be
performed only by the agency head.   Such duties would include duties
established by regulation for the officer during any part of the 180 days
before the vacancy occurred, notwithstanding subsequent regulations that
purported to limit those duties.   The sanction could be ended if the
President were to submit a nominee after the 150-day period, at which time
the acting officer could resume service. Actions taken in violation of the
vacant officer provisions would be of no effect and would not be permitted
to be ratified by anyone else. The shifting of duties to the agency head
would not apply to vacancies in the positions of general counsel to the
National Labor Relations Board or the Federal Labor Relations Authority or
to Senate-confirmed inspectors general, given the specific goal Congress
established for those positions of independence from the agency heads.

The bill also would require the heads of Executive agencies to report to
the General Accounting Office the existence of vacancies, persons serving
in an acting capacity, the names of any nominees, and dates of disposition
of such nominees.  The Comptroller General then would report to the
Congress, the President, and the Office of Personnel Management the
existence of any violations of the Vacancies Act.  The 150~day period for
submitting nominations would be extended for an additional 90 days for
vacancies that exist when a new President swears or affirms the oath of
office as President or that arise in the 60 days thereafter.   In addition,
the bill would maintain holdover provisions in current law that apply to
single-member independent agencies and would exempt members of
multi-member independent agencies altogether, as the Vacancies Act does
currently.

S. 2176 would apply to any office that becomes vacant after the date of
enactment.  In addition, it would apply to offices that are vacant on the
date of enactment; however, the bill would apply to those offices as


though they first became vacant on the date of enactment.

Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

According to VAPD (***) and BASD (***), S. 2176 would not affect direct
spending and receipts; therefore, it is not subject to the pay-as-you-go
requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. CBO concurs.
