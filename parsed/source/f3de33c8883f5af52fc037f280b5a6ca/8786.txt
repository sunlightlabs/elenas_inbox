Please take a quick look at this and tell me if you like the style and
format.

I think we will most effectively discredit this bill if we cite ,evidence
that raises serious doubts about whether the bill will reduce youth
smoking. Thus, I thought we should go beyond the typical one pager
without getting too wonky.    While I take the blame for the concept, CD
did all the hard work.  ==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

            The House Republican Tobacco LegislationWilI Not Reduce Youth Smoking
                                    July 28, 1998 DRAFT

    President Clinton has undertaken an historic and unprecedented effort to reduce youth
    smoking in order to save 1 million lives over five years. Nearly three years ago the President
    proposed tough new rules to require the FDA to regulate advertising targetted at children and
    stop sales of tobacco products to underage youth. Last September, the President called on
    Congress to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation to stop young Americans from smoking
    before they start including: a substantial increase in the price of cigarettes combined with
    additional surcharges on companies that continue to sell to kids; full authority for the Food and
    Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products; changes in the way the tobacco industry does
    business, including an end to marketing and promotion to kids; progress toward other public
    health goals, including biomedical and cancer research, a reduction in second-hand smoke, and
    smoking cessation programs; and protection for tobacco farmers and their communities.

    The House Republican tobacco legislation fails to take the steps necessary to reduce youth
    smoking. By advancing their bill, House Republican members are doing what the tohacco
    lobby wants, not what American parents want. Three thousand young people start smoking
    every day; one thousand will die early as a result. A bill written by the tobacco industry won't
    save children's lives, and it won't save the political lives of the politicians who cynically
    promote it. The only thing the House Republican bill does about teen smoking is to let the
    industry keep getting away with it.

    THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN BILL:

           Fails to raise the price of cigarettes -- ignoring scientific consensus at the expense of
            children's lives.

                   The President proposed raising the price of cigarettes by $1.10 over 5 years -- an
                    increase that both the Treasury Department and the Congressional Budget Office
                    agree would reduce youth smoking by a third over the next 5 years.

                   Numerous scientific studies demonstrate that teen smoking is responsive to
                    changes in the price of cigarettes. A consensus view is that the number of teen
                    smokers declines by about 7 percent for a 10 percent increase in the real price of
                    cigarettes. 1

                   Moreover, recently released tobacco company documents demonstrate that the
                                                                                           tobacc

   Allows tobacco companies to continue advertising to children. While studies show
    that industry advertising significantly contributes to teen smoking rates, House
    Republicans refuse to impose meaningful advertising restrictions on an industry that has
    preyed upon our children for decades.

          The Treasury Department has estimated that the advertising and marketing
           restrictions proposed by the President would cut youth smoking by about 15
           percent. This is a conservative estimate -- a recent study by the American
           Medical Association found that a full 34% ofteen smoking is attributable to
           promotional activities targeting children [cite].

          The advertising restrictions proposed by the President would be enforced by the
           FDA and include:

           _ Banning outdoor advertising within 1000 feet of schools and public
                       playgrounds;
           _ Restricting advertising to black-and-white text only, except in publications
                   with a predominant adult readership or at adult only facilities;
           _ Prohibiting the sale or giveaways of promotional products such as caps or gym
               bags that carry cigarette or smokeless tobacco brand names or logos; and
           _ Prohibiting brand-name sponsorship of sporting or entertainment events.

          FDA authority over tobacco advertising will be far more effective in reducing
                                                               youth smoking than placing

   Proposes weak initiatives that will do little to reduce youth smoking. While
    numerous studies show that significant price increases and advertising restrictions reduce
    youth smoking, research also shows that other related initiatives have the potential to
    reduce youth smoking rates. However, the ultimate effectiveness of these initiatives
    depend on a number offactors -- they must be well-funded, comprehensive in nature,
    combined with other anti-smoking initiatives, and coupled with strong enforcement
    measures. By neglecting many of these factors, the House Republican bill falls short in
    several key respects.

    x Counteradvertising initiative is underfunded and lacks coordination with other
    efforts.

     x Provisions are neither comprehensive nor combined with other initiatives.
           Studies demonstrate that a comprehensive package of strong anti-smoking
            initiatives that target young people and reinforce one another will be far more
            effective in reducing youth smoking than isolated steps. Unfortunately, the
            House bill does not provide funding for potentially effective interventions such as
            school-based prevention or education programs, and teen cessation programs.

HOUSE REPUBLICAN BILL FALLS SHORT IN OTHER MAJOR RESPECTS:

    Limits the FDA's authority over tobacco products, which will hinder its ability to help
     stop young people from smoking before they start.

    Fails to impose tough lookback surcharges on tobacco companies that do not take the
     steps necessary to reduce youth smoking. Without the incentives necessary to change
     industry behavior, the industry will continue to market to children with impunity.

    Fails to fund a major increase in funding for public health programs or health
     research at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control.

    Fails to protect children and workers from the hazards of environmental tobacco
     smoke.

    Fails to include critical protections for tobacco farmers who have done nothing wrong
     and deserve to be protected. Any tobacco legislation that achieves meaningful
     reductions in smoking rates must contain key protections for farmers and farming
     communities.
