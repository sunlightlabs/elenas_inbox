The Administration is pleased that the bipartisan budget agreement reflects a number of the
President's highest priorities on welfare. It includes the President's proposal for a $3 billion
welfare to work fund (which is a centerpiece of the President's second-term agenda), restoring
benefits to legal immigrants, and creating new work opportunities for individuals subject to the
food stamp work requirement.

However, we are very concerned that, as the legislation carrying out the budget agreement takes
shape in committee, it must not violate the spirit or letter of that bipartisan agreement. Further,
this legislation should not become a vehicle for other provisions that do not have bipartisan
support. (GET OMB OK on this statement??)

The House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal does deviate in significant ways from that
bipartisan agreement, and so the Administration strongly opposes it in its current form.

Welfare to Work
     First, it is important to note that, on the critical issue of welfare to work, the
      Administration is pleased that the Ways and Means Subcommittee $3 billion proposal
      meets many of the Administration's priorities. These include targeting funds to areas
      and individuals with high needs, directing funds to cities and local governments,
      awarding some funds competitively, and allowing communities to create successful job
      placement and creation programs. We are very disappointed at the proposal lacks
      adequate worker protections and non-displacement provisions, and urge the
      subcommittee to add stronger language to better protect against worker displacement.

Legal Immigrants
      The Ways and Means Subcommittee's proposed amendment to the welfare law clearly
       violates the negotiated, bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a minimal safety net
       for disabled legal immigrants. The Subcommittee's proposal would restore SSI and
       Medicaid benefits only to immigrants (both the disabled and non-disabled elderly)
       already receiving benefits prior to August 23, 1996; by contrast, the bipartisan budget
       agreement policy restores SSI and Medicaid benefits to any immigrant in the country as
       of that date who is or becomes disabled. The budget agreement targets assistance to the
       most vulnerable individuals.

      The Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal ignores vulnerable immigrants who
       become disabled after August 22, 1996. By the year 2000, the Subcommittee proposal
       would protect 75,000 fewer immigrants than the budget agreement.

      The Administration also strongly opposes the Subcommittee's initial proposal not to
       restore benefits for SSI beneficiaries whose sponsors have income over 150% of the
       poverty level. However, it appears that it has decided to drop this proposal. This
       proposal would cut off 100,000 severely disabled immigrants who would receive benefits
       under the budget agreement, and would be unfair to families of limited means.


                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
    The Administration strongly opposes the Ways and Means Subcommittee's provision on
     the minimum wage. The Subcommittee proposes that welfare recipients engaged in
     workfare not be considered employees for the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
     It would permit states to count child care, Medicaid, and housing benefits in their
     calculation of the minimum wage, and to meet the work requirements by counting hours
     engaged in job search, education, and training beyond those currently allowed by the
     welfare law.

     This Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal would undermine the fundamental goals
      of welfare reform. The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work
      must work -- and that those who work should earn the minimum wage, whether they are
      coming off of welfare or not. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal does
      not meet this test.

     The Administration stands ready to work with Congress and states to discuss alternative
      proposals that do not undermine the minimum wage or weaken the law's work
      requirements.
