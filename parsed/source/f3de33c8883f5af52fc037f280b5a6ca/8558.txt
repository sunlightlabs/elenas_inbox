    It's a bit nerdy (footnotes and all) but I think that would serve our
    purposes -- it will help us make the case that there is overwhelming
    evidence that price increases will reduce youth smoking.

Over 3 million teenagers smoke cigarettes on a daily basis in the United States. An additional 2
million smoke on a less than daily basis, but are at risk of becoming chronic daily users.

       The most recent data show that 25 percent of high school seniors were daily smokers;
        another 12 percent smoked on a less than daily basis. In addition, underage youth
        smoking has been on an upward trend - smoking rates among high school students rose
        by nearly a third between 1991 and 1997, from 27.5 percent to 36.4 percent.

Reducing youth smoking is the best way to reduce the overall incidence of smoking in the future;
 90 percent of adult daily smokers first begin smoking cigarettes as teenagers.

The most reliable method for reducing teen smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes.

       Recently released tobacco company documents demonstrate that the tobacco industry has
        known for years that youths are very responsive to price. A 1981 Philip Morris memo
        analyzed the research and concluded "it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the
        smoking prevalence of teenagers."

       A large number of rigorous economic studies have shown that teen smoking is responsive
        to changes in the price of cigarettes. A consensus view is that the number of teen
        smokers declines by about 7 percent for a 10 percent increase in the real price of
        cigarettes. [

                 This relationship represents the response for a very small change in prices. Our
                 model allows the responsiveness to decline as prices rise, since the smokers that
                 remain at high prices have revealed that they are less responsive to price signals.

Additional efforts beyond price changes can help to reduce youth smoking - such as eliminating
vending machines, enforcing restrictions on sales to youths, eliminating advertising aimed at
youths, and anti-smoking counter-advertising.

       Studies have shown that fully-enforced sales restrictions have successfully led to
        reductions in youth smoking, particularly for younger teens.

                 A 1991 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported a 69
                 percent decline in daily use by seventh and eighth graders in Woodridge, Illinois
                 following legislation 'and enforcement of restrictions on cigarette sales to minors.2

                A recent working paper comparing the effectiveness of state and local access
                restrictions estimates that comprehensive access restrictions for youth can lower
                youth smoking by 18%.4

                A number of experts in this area suggest that a conservative assumption for the
                impact of comprehensive sales and marketing restrictions is a 10-20% reduction
                in youth smoking. Based on their opinion and the existing literature, we use 15%
                in our estimates.

Hence, a coordinated effort of sizeable price increases and fully-enforced access and advertising
restrictions would be more likely to produce a significant and sustained decline in youth smoking
than either policy by itself.

       The Administration's Budget proposal calls for a significant increase in the real price of
        cigarettes over the next five years. Coupled with comprehensive sales and advertising
        restrictions, that price increase will lead to about a 42 percent reduction in underage teen
        smoking in five years.

       In 2003 alone, the number of young people kept from smoking would be about 1.6
        million teens.

       Over the next five years, the total number of young people kept from smoking would be
        about 3 million teens.

       The direct result ofthese policies over the next five years is that about 1 million of
        today's young people will be spared from premature deaths resulting from
        smoking-related diseases.

These estimates illustrate the powerful impact of a combination of price increases and
access/marketing restrictions on youth smoking. But there remains some uncertainty in our
estimates of the impact of these policies.

       That is why the President has also called for youth smoking penalties on the tobacco
        industry if they do not meet targeted reductions in youth smoking. These penalties will
        help to ensure that we meet our youth targets.

                      Background on Youth Smoking Elasticity Estimates


The Treasury Model

        The Treasury model of youth smoking starts from a participation elasticity of -0.7 at the
         current price level of about $1.95 - which means that a 10% increase in price above its
         current level would reduce the number. of teen smokers by 7%.

        But this relationship only holds for very small price changes. For larger and larger
         price increases, the Treasury model predicts somewhat smaller proportional reductions in
         teen smoKing. This reflects the fact that the teens most likely to respond t6 price signals
         are also the first to be discouraged from smoking by a price increase.

        Using this model, a $1.10 increase in the real price of cigarettes is projected to reduce
         youth smoking by 32%. Since a $1.10 increase in the real price in 2003 represents a
         53% rise, the associated "average" elasticity is actually _0.6. 5

Industry Views Validate Administration Analysis

        Recently released internal documents from Philip Morris demonstrate that the tobacco
         industry has known for years that youths are very responsive to price.

        A memo from 1981 documents that the tobacco industry understands the compelling
         evidence that youths are very price responsive. This document is a review of the 1981
         working paper by Lewit, Coate, and Grossman, discussed below. This industry review is
         very favorable, and does not question this substantial estimate of youth price
         responsiveness. As the memo states, "The authors of this paper ... have constructed an
         elegant longitudinal and cross-sectional model of teenage smoking behavior ... The most
         important finding, and the one of greatest significance to the company, is their calculation
         of the price elasticity of cigarettes among teenagers."

        This memo goes on to state " ... it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the
         smoking prevalence of teenagers, and that the goals of reducing teenage smoking and
         balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the Federal excise tax on
         cigarettes. "




         5 The semi-logarithmic demand function underlying this analysis is based on a standard model used to
predict overall cigarette demand. Under it, every dime ($0.10) increase in price reduces demand by the same
percent, but since it is doing so from a smaller and smaller base at each step, the absolute reduction in teen smoking
from each 10 cent increment declines slightly.


                                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                                HC)t텽wnp Conversion
          below. Another Philip Morris strategic planning document from the early 1990s states:
          "There is no question that increasing taxes will cause a decrease in smoking. This point
          is best illustrated by the present situation in Canada."

         In another document dated September 3, 1987, a Philip Morris analysis of price increases
          concluded: "price increases ... prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke ...
          We don't need to have that happen again."

Previous Academic Studies

         A number of studies have attempted to estimate the responsiveness of youth smoking in
          the U.S. to price changes - the participation elasticity, or the change in the number of
          teen smokers due to price changes. This literature is based on comparisons of youth
          smoking rates in high and low tax states, and on changes in youth smoking within states
          as tax rates change.

         The CBO recently summarized this literature by stating that most of the evidence points
          to participation elasticities ranging from -0.50 to -0.75. The Treasury estimate is in the
          range used by the CEO.

         The results from this literature are shown in the Table below. Because differences in
          elasticity estimates may be less intuitive, the table shows - for each analysis of youth
          smoking - the projected reduction in teen smokers from a $1.10 price increase (along
          with the Treasury estimates). This approach recognizes the fact that the Treasury model
          allows the elasticity to decline for larger price increases.

      question. Indeed, our estimates are more conservative than what most of the recent work
      in this area would suggest.

     One study which estimates a very different response from the remainder of the literature
      (Wasserman et al.) focuses exclusively on the late 1970s. During this period some
      surveys indicate that youth smoking fell precipitously without a price increase. We
      believe a more appropriate interpretation of the data during the late 1970's is that youth
      smoking was driven down by the broader dissemination of facts about smoking's dangers.
       According to one major survey, only half of 12th graders saw a great risk in smoking a
      pack or more of cigarettes a day in 1975 - the lowest level in the survey - but this
      number increased by nearly 25% between 1975 and 1980. Thus, rather than indicating
      that price does not affect youth smoking, we believe this data shows that other things can
      influence teens in addition to price.

     This same problem has led to a misinterpretation by some of the Evans and Huang paper.
      As Professor William Evans of Maryland pointed out in a recent letter to the Commerce
      Committee, the findings of his paper have been misquoted. As noted in the Table above,
      the estimate that Evans stands behind is very close to the Administration estimate. The
      confusion over his findings arises from the fact that his estimates which include data from
      the lat~ 1970s show a smaller youth elasticity than his estimates which focus on the 1980s
      and 1990s. As Prof. Evans has noted, however, the data are less reliable for this earlier
      period; in addition, as noted above, this was an era when non-price factors were driving
      teen smoking down in the face of constant prices.

The Cornell Study

     Some have cited the recent study by DeCicca et al. as refuting the previous literature. In
      fact, this study finds higher estimates than the remainder of the literature when standard
      estimation techniques are used on their full sample of 8th-12th graders. 6 .

     The study does find smaller effects when they choose the particular sample of 12th
      graders who weren't smoking in 8th grade, and try to model whether they start smoking.
      But there is no obvious explanation for this anomalous result; after all, removing from
      their model a population that is more addicted to cigarettes - individuals smoking from
      8th to 12th grade - should raise, not lower, the elasticity estimate. It is troubling that
      dropping only 5% of their sample - the 5% of teens that are most addicted - reduces
      their estimate so dramatically.




      6The estimate cited in our Table is an average of their elasticities for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.


                                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                                  Hex텱UI11p Conversion
      methodology. A recent re-analysis of their data by Professors Thomas Dee of Georgia
      Tech and William Evans of Maryland has found these results to be very sensitive to the
      particular sample restrictions imposed by the Cornell authors. As these experts note,
      "The results appear to be purely an artifact of the way that the authors constructed the
      analysis sample." When a broader sample of observations is used, there is a very
      significant effect of taxes on youth smoking in their onset model-- indeed, the results are
      quite comparable to the previous literature.

     This partly explains why the results of the Cornell study are so statistically imprecise.
      For example, in this particular model, they estimate that a $1.10 price rise would reduce
      smoking onset by only 7%. However, given the level of statistical imprecision in their
      model, their findings would be equally consistent with a reduction in youth onset of 50%
      or more from this $1.10 price increase - a range which encompasses the Treasury
      estimate, as well as their own estimates using a more straightforward methodology.

     One criticism levied by DeCicca et al. against the earlier literature is that it does not
      control for differences across states at a point in time that might determine youth smoking
      propensities; low tax states may have high smoking because of other regulatory or
      cultural factors. But their approach does not solve this problem; it still relies on
      point-in-time comparisons of smoking onset across states, making it difficult to separate
      out other differences across those states. Other studies address this problem much more
      directly. Chaloupka and Grossman (1996) do so by including a variety of state
      characteristics, including state anti-tobacco regulations. Evans and Huang (1997)
      address the problem even more directly by examining only the effect of within-state price
      changes on youth smoking. The fact that these estimates are so similar to that used by
      Treasury highlights the robustness of the conclusions, and indicates why the previous
      scientific consensus is not undermined by one set of anomalous results.

International Evidence

     There has also been much recent attention paid to the fact that youth smoking remains
      high in other countries with much higher cigarette prices. In particular, Wall Street
      analyst Martin Feldman noted in his testimony of March 19th that youth smoking rose in
      the U.K. between 1988 and 1996, despite a 26% rise in the real price of cigarettes. The
      inference that is often drawn from this type of evidence is that higher prices won't deter
      youth smoking in the U.S.

     But these international comparisons do not tell us much ofanything about the response
      ofyouth in the u.s. to price changes. The fact that youth smoking rates remain high in
      other countries reflects other cultural factors that influence youth to smoke, and is not a
      rejection of the fundamental relationship between price and demand. And increased
      smoking among youth in the U.K. between 1988 and 1996 may have more to do with
      other factors, such as a recession which raised youth unemployment rates by 25% over
      this period, than with changes in the price of cigarettes. In light ofthis concern, it is
      certainly preferable to rely on careful, controlled analysis of U.S. teen smoking than on
      this type of anecdotal international evidence.
                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
    appropriate one would be to Canada, since it is more similar to and faces many of the
    same cultural influences as the US. The two economic studies which estimate the
    effects of cigarette prices on Canadian teens are both consistent with the findings in the
    US. literature - teens are not only responsive to price changes, but they are more
    responsive than adults. In fact, the Canadian youth elasticity estimates are higher than
    those for the U.S.

   Moreover, the pattern of youth smoking in Canada during the 1980s confirms the
    sensitivity of youth to price changes.

   In 1981, youth smoking was pervasive in Canada -- 43.S% of Canadian teen were current
    smokers (defined as having smoked in the last thirty days). The youth smoking rate
    during this period was about SO% higher than in the US.

   Over the next decade, Canada significantly increased the price of cigarettes. From 1981
    to 1989, the price increased by about 90%. It is worth noting that these price increases
    occurred without significant smuggling; the widely cited smuggling episode from Canada
    did not occur until 1992-1993, when cigarette prices had risen by more than $1.S0 above
    their 1989 level.

   These price increases were associated with enormous declines in teen smoking. From
    1981 to 1989, current Canadian teen smoking rates fell from 43.S% to 22.6%, a decline of
    almost fifty percent. During this period there were no substantial change in teen
    smoking rates in the US., so by 1991 Canada's teen smoking rate was lower than ours.

   The implied Canadian elasticity of -0.S2 is very close to the estimate that would be
    computed by the Treasury model (which allows the price responsiveness to fall as the
    magnitude of the price increase grows) for this large a price rise, which is an elasticity of
    -O.SI. The large declines in Canadian youth smoking rates represent largely the impacts
    of price increases, as opposed to other public policies designed to curb teen smoking.
    From 1981 to 1989, Canada did not impose any significant public health policy changes
    designed to reduce teen smoking.

   In the early 1990s, smuggling did become a problem in Canada, and the government
    lowered dramatically its federal excise taxes. As a result, between 1991 and 1994 teen
    smoking began to rise again in Canada. Of course, teen smoking was on the rise in the
    U.S. over this period as well, so it is not as easy to attribute all ofthe rise in Canada over
