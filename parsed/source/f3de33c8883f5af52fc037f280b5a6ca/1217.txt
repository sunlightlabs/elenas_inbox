MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN:




THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

Marion Barry, Jr., Mayor
Charlene Drew Jarvis, Council President Pro Tern



DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MANAGEMENT
ASSISTANCE AUTHORITY

Authority "Affirm or Attest")

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
SECTION I.             PURPOSE

The parties respect the Home Rule Charter as the fundamental basis for governance in the
District. The purpose of this memorandum is to strengthen Home Rule and to agree to work
toward the revitalization of the District of Columbia.

This memorandum is intended only to improve the management of, and the relationship between,
the District of Columbia and the Federal Government, and is not intended to and does not create
any right, benefit, trust or responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity
by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.


SECTION II. PUBLIC LAW 104-8, "THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FINANCIAL
                 RESPONSIBILITY AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF
                 1995"

The parties recognize the effectiveness of PL 104-8 and dedicate themselves to the cooperative
implementation of its provisions. Among these provisions: (Note the purpose of this listing of
provisions is to remind everyone of the obligations that the District already has. Treasury at one
time had wanted "general conditions" I believe that a restatement of the Authority language
(either these provisions or others) serves this purpose. However, we could easily delete the
specifics. )

Finance.

·      For each Fiscal Year for which the District is in a control period, the Mayor shall develop
       and submit to the Financial Authority and Council a financial plan and budget for the
       applicable Fiscal Year and the next 3 Fiscal Years.

·      Expenditures for the District government for each Fiscal Year, beginning in FY1999, may
       not exceed revenues for that Fiscal Year.

·      During Fiscal Years 1996, 1997, and 1998, the District government shall make
       continuous, substantial progress toward equalizing its expenditures and revenues.

·      The District may not borrow money during a control year unless the Authority provides
       prior certification that the borrowing is consistent with the financial plan and budget for
       the year.

·      For the Secretary of the Treasury to make a short-term advance to the District, an
       Authority-approved budget and financial plan must be in place, the Mayor must submit a
       requisition for an advance including a schedule for timing and amounts for advances, the
       Inspector General certifies the accuracy of the information provided to the Secretary, the
       Secretary determines -- and the Authority certifies -- that the District lacks market access
       on reasonable terms, and that the Treasury has reasonable assurance of being reimbursed.
                                                                                  .\Ianagement System

Management.

·    An Office of the Chief Financial Officer will be established in the executive branch of the
     District government, headed by the Chief Financial Officer, and including the Office of
     the Treasurer, Controller, Budget, Financial Information Services, and Finance and
     Revenue.

·    An Office of the Inspector General will be established in the executive branch of the
     District government.

·    During the control period, the Mayor shall submit proposed contracts and leases to the
     Authority for review, and cannot enter into a contract or a lease unless the Authority
     determines it is consistent with the financial plan and budget.

·    The Authority may submit recommendations to the Mayor, the Council, the President,
                                                         and Congress on actions the

                                                         whether the District will
                                                         adopt the recommendations.
                                                         An affirmative statement
                                                         must include a written

            offenders through the Control Board to the Offender Supervision and Courts
            Services Trustee. The head of any Federal department or agency may provide the
            services of any personnel to the Trusteeship to assist in carrying out its duties.

4.1.1. 7.   During the transition period, under the general auspices of the Trustee, the PDS
            will continue uninterrupted to provide services to D.C. Code defendants and the

            personnel as may be necessary.

4.1.1.8.    During the transition period, the employees of and funds allocated to the Offender
            Services and Courts Trustee and the agencies for which the Trustee is responsible
            shall not be counted against the personnel and budget ceiling imposed on the
            District of Columbia by the Control Board or Congress. (N.B. placeholder
            language required clarification and/or citation).

4.1.1.9.    The Federal government will assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of
            contracting for limited bed space at the District's Correctional Treatment Facility
            (CTF) as may be necessary to supplement existing Federal detention and
            treatment contracts.

4.2.     Administration of District of Columbia and Federal Prisons

4.2.1. Federal Government Responsibilities

       4.2.1.1.   The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) will house felons, in correctional institutions
                  operated or contracted by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, who were convicted of
                  violating the D.C. Code and sentenced to terms of imprisonment, after the BOP's
                  capacity has been increased through renovation of existing facilities and new
                  construction at the corrections complex in Lorton, Virginia and other locations
                  seiected by the BOP. D.C. Code offenders will be housed together with Federal
                  offenders in BOP facilities based on inmate program and security needs and BOP
                  population management regulations. The BOP will oversee the operation of
                  community corrections centers in the District of Columbia as necessary to provide
                  an appropriate transition for inmates who are nearing release from Federal
                  prisons, including those convicted of D.C. Code violations. The BP intends to
                  use existing community corrections centers in the District of Columbia to the
                  extent practicable and will work with D.C. officials in the identification of
                  prospective sites, as needed to establish new community correction facilities.


                                                  13
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion


4.2.1.2.   The BOP intends to operate several correctional facilities in Lorton, Virginia and
           elsewhere to house a mix of both Federal and D.C. felons. Every effort will be
           made to house D.C. felons at facilities that are as close to the District of Columbia
           as permitted by inmate program and security needs and BOP population
           management regulations. D.C. felons will be designated in the same manner as
           Federal inmates, and ordinarily initially assigned to institutions located within a
           SOO-mile radius of their residence. BOP also will work with D.C. officials to
           identify sites for possible Federal correctional facility construction within the
           District.

4.2.1.3.   Based upon assurances from the District of Columbia that felons convicted of
           violating the D.C. Code will, in the future, receive sentences similar to those
           received by comparable offenders convicted of comparable Federal offenses,
           during the transition period, the BOP will house those sentenced D.C. felons in
           the custody of the D.C. Department of Corrections as the Director of the BOP
           deems appropriate in accordance with available capacity. After October 1, 2001,
           the BOP will accept D.C. felons sentenced under the new sentencing structure in
           accordance with the capacity of the BOP. By October 1, 2002, and assuming
           fulfillment of all requisite conditions, the BOP will have assumed responsibility
           for incarcerating all D.C. felons.

4.2.1.4.   The BOP will accept employment applications from persons currently employed
           by the District of Columbia Department of Corrections for BOP vacancies and
           will make hiring selections in accordance with existing Federal procedures and
           standards. Positions for new BOP facilities will be advertised prior to being
           filled.

4.2.1.5.   The Attorney General will select, with the approval of the Chairman of the D.C.
           Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, and in
           consultation with the Mayor of the District of Columbia, a Trustee to oversee
           operations of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections relating to
           incarcerated felons, until the BOP assumes responsibility for all incarcerated D.C.
           felons.

4.2.1.6.   The Federal government will transfer funds for the incarceration of D.C. felons
           through the Financial Authority to the Trustee. The head of any Federal
           department or agency may provide the services of any personnel to the Trustee to
           assist in carrying out the Trustee's duties.

4.2.1.7.   Of the funds received by the Trustee from Congress through the Financial
           Authority, the Trustee will reimburse to the BOP those funds identified by
           Congress to be used for the construction of new facilities and the renovation of
           existing facilities. The Federal Bureau of Prisons will be responsible and
           accountable for determining how these funds will be used, including type, security
           level, and location of new facilities.


                                            14
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

       4.2.1.8.   During the transition period, the employees of, and appropriations allocated to, the
                  Corrections Trustee and the agencies for which the Trustee is responsible shall not
                  be scored or counted against the personnel and budget ceilings imposed on the
                  District of Columbia by the Financial Authority or Congress. [N.B. placeholder
                  language requires clarification].

B.       District a/Columbia Responsibilities

       4.2.2.1.   Offenders convicted of violations of the D.C. Code shall be sentenced pursuant to
                  a new D.C. sentencing system, described below. If the new sentencing system is
                  not promulgated within [24 months], however, the BOP may not obligate any
                  funds appropriated for the absorption of D.C. Code felons into the Federal prison
                  system and will have no responsibility to house any persons convicted of felony
                  offenses under the D.C. Code.

       4.2.2.2.   The District of Columbia will continue to house felons sentenced to terns of
                  imprisonment by the District of Columbia Superior Court until such persons have
                  been designated by the BOP. To the extent beds are available, the District of
                  Columbia will continue to house felons sentenced to .terms of imprisonment by
                  the U.S. District Court until such persons have been designated by the BOP, and
                  will continue to receive reimbursement at a mutually negotiated rate by the
                  Federal government for costs of housing such persons.

       4.2.2.3.   The Trustee will operate under the general auspices of the Chairman of the
                  Financial Authority and can be removed only by the Attorney General.

       4.2.2.4.   The Trustee will propose funding requests for the incarceration of D.C. felons to
                  the Financial Authority, and the request will be included in the Financial
                  Authority budget to the President and Congress each fiscal year.

       4.2.2.5.   The Trustee will allocate funds to the District of Columbia Department of
                  Corrections, including funds for short-term improvements that are necessary for
                  the safety and security of staff, inmates, and the community.

       4.2.2.6.   Upon receipt from the Financial Authority of Federal funds identified by Congress
                  for constructing new prisons and making major renovations to existing facilities
                  for the incarceration of D.C. felons, the Trustee will immediately reimburse such
                  funds to the BOP.

       4.2.2.7.   The D.C. Corporation Counsel will provide representation for the Trustee and
                  Trustee-supervised agencies (see the litigation and liability section).

4.3.     Sentencing

      The District of Columbia understands and agrees that the D.C. sentencing system will be
changed, pursuant to the proposed Act, in the following manner:

                                                   15
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


4.3.1. Congress will amend the D.C. Code to abolish parole for all persons convicted of D.C.·
       offenses (felonies and misdemeanors) committed on or after 3 years from the date of
       enactment of the Act.

4.3.2. Congress will amend the D.C. Code so that good time calculations for all persons
       convicted of D.C. offenses (felonies and misdemeanors) committed on or after 3 years
       from the date of enactment of the Act will be made according to the Federal
       requirements.

4.3.3. Congress will establish a new D.C. Board of Criminal Sentences (the Board) as an
       independent body within the D.C. government. All persons convicted of D.C. felonies
       committed on or after 3 years from the date of enactment of the Act will be sentenced
       according to a determinate sentencing system promulgated by the Board no later than 18
       months after the date of enactment of the Act.

4.3.4. The Board will develop such amendments or repeals of provisions in the D.C. Code
       relating to the maximum and minimum prison terms as are necessary to accomplish the
       purposes of the Act. Ninety days after they are promulgated by the Board, the sentencing
       system, amendments and repeals will become effective unless disapproved as a whole by
       a majority of the District of Columbia Council. If disapproved by the Council, the
       system may be enacted by Congressional action.

4.3.5. The promulgated sentencing system will supersede any inconsistent provision of the D.C.
       Code and will provide for post-release supervision of offenders.

4.3.6. Congress will repeal certain other provisions of the D.C. Code to conform with the new
       sentencing system (D.C. Code Title 24, Chapters 2 and 8], including the Youth
       Rehabilitation Act.

4.3.7. The sentencing system developed will ensure the effective continuation of the D.C.
       Superior Court Drug Intervention Program by including appropriate minimum mandatory
       sentences and adequate related judicial discretion.

4.3.8. Congress will amend the D.C. Code Title 33, section 541 to adopt certain mandatory
       penalties necessary for effective local law enforcement.

4.3.9. The Board will not have the authority to provide for capital punishment under any law
       applicable exclusively in the District of Columbia.

4.3.10. The Board will have seven voting members. The Attorney General (or her designee) will
        chair the Board. The other members will include two judges of the D.C. Superior Court
        and one representative each for the D.C. Council, the Executive Branch of the D.C.
        government, the D.C. Public Defender Service, and the U.S. Attorney for the District of
        Columbia. A representative of the Bureau of Prisons will serve as a non-voting, ex
        officio member.

                                              16
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion



4.3.11. An affirmative vote of at least six Board members will be necessary to adopt guidelines,
        promulgate the sentencing system, and make any amendments or repeals of D.C. Code
        provisions relating to maximum and minimum prison terms.

4.3.12. In developing the sentencing system, the Board will hold three or more public hearings,
        review appropriate State system models, consult with sentencing reform experts, and
        solicit written comments from the public.

4.3.13. If the Board fails to promulgate a sentencing system within 18 months, the Board will
        terminate and the Attorney General will develop the system and transmit it to the Council
        for approval. The system will take effect unless the D.C. Council disapproves the system
        and Congress, in tum, does not approve it.

4.3.14. The Board will have the mandate to ensure that the sentencing system it establishes,
        among other things:

     4.3.14.1. Will result in sentences for those convicted of felony offenses similar to those that
               would be imposed upon comparable offenders convicted of comparable offenses
               in the Federal system;

     4.3.14.2. Will result in sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense and provide for
               just punishment, afford adequate deterrence to potential future criminal conduct of
               the offender and others, and provide the defendant with needed educational or
               vocational training, medical care, and other correctional treatment;

     4.3.14.3. Will provide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing,
               avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among similar defendants, while
               maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences;

     4.3.14.4. Will take into account the high volume of sentencing proceedings in the District
               of Columbia Superior Court as bearing upon the degree of complexity of the
               sentencing system; and

     4.3.14.5. Will ensure that the system is neutral as to the race, sex, marital status, ethnic
               origin, religious affiliation, national origin, creed, socioeconomic status, and
               sexual orientation of offenders, if not related to the commission of the offense.

4.3.15. As part of the sentencing system, the Board will develop binding guidelines for use in
      . determining the sentence to be imposed upon convicted felons. The guidelines will
        specify:

     4.3.15.1. When to impose a sentence to probation, a fine, or a term of imprisonment and the
               appropriate amount or length, as well as intermediate sanctions;




                                                17
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion



       4.3.15.2. When to impose a term of supervised release following imprisonment, and the
                 appropriate length; and

       4.3.15.3. Whether multiple sentences to terms of imprisonment should run concurrently or
                 consecutively.

4.3.16. Thirty days after promulgating the sentencing system, the Board will be terminated.
        There will be a successor Federal agency in the judicial branch to amend the guidelines
        consistent with the purposed of the Act. The D.C. Council may recommend to Congress
        whether or not these amendments should be approved. The amendments will take effect
        as prescribed by the successor agency, however, unless they are modified or disapproved
        by Congress. The successor agency will have no powers to revise the District of
        Columbia Code but will recommend changes to the Code as may be necessary to further
        the purposes of the Act.

4.3.17. The D.C. Superior Court, D.C. Department of Corrections, and other agencies as
        necessary will submit information about convicted felons as required by the Board and
        the U.S. Department of Justice. This would permit an assessment of the extent to which
        sentences imposed by the D.C. Superior Court are comparable to those imposed for
        comparable offenders by U.S. District Courts. The results of this assessment would be
        used by the Board in developing the new sentencing system for the District of Columbia.

4.3.18. Four years after the new sentencing system takes effect, there will be an evaluation to
        determine the extent to which the sentencing system has succeeded in accomplishing the
        goals set forth in the Act.



4.4.     Liability and Litigation Authority

4.4.1. Federal Government Responsibilities

       4.4.1.1.   United States, its agencies, and personnel will not incur any liability on the basis
                  of the activities of the District of Columbia, its agencies, or personnel as a result
                  of the reforms agreed to in this Memorandum of Understanding.

       4.4.1.2.   The Attorney General, in her discretion, will have the authority to direct any
                  litigation involving the Trustees, pretrial services, and sentencing reform during
                  the transitional period, and to provide litigation services for the Trustees and the
                  agencies responsible for pretrial services and sentencing reform during the
