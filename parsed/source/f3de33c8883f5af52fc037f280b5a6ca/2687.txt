                       To GROW STEADY AND STRONG UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON
                                                   May 30, 1997



    TODAY'S REVISED GDP DATA SHOW THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY CONTINUES TO ENJOY
    ROBUST GROWTH AND MODERATE INFLATION. IN THE FIRST QUARTER, THE ECONOMY
    GREW BY 5.8 PERCENT AT AN ANNUAL RATE -- THE FASTEST IN A DECADE. REAL INCOMES
    ARE RISING. AND INFLATION REMAINS MODERATE.

          Growth was 5.8 percent on an annualized basis. Investment in business equipment rose 13.4
           percent, and exports rose 11.2 percent.

          Private-sector growth continues to be stronger than either of the previous two Administrations. In the
           first quarter, the private sector grew by 7.1 percent at an annual rate. Under Clinton, the private
           sector has grown by 3.5 percent per year, compared to 3.0 percent under Reagan and 1.3 percent
           under Bush.

          Inflation remains low. Inflation as measured by the GDP price index was 2.2 percent in the first
           quarter. Consumer price inflation -- 2.8 percent per year -- is the lowest for any administration
           since John F. Kennedy was President.

          First investment-led expansion in three decades.  Under President Clinton, business investment has
           increased at a 10.5 percent annual rate -- stronger than any Administration since JFK.

          Once again the Administrations forecasts seem conservative. In this year's budget, we projected
           growth for 1997 to be 2.2 percent -- and even if there is no growth for the rest of the year, we
           have already exceeded that.

    WE HAVE 12.1 MILLION NEW JOBS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS THE LOWEST IN 24 YEARS.
     THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE STRONG GROWTH, RAPID INVESTMENT, AND
    LOW INFLATION.

                     EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG:

          Fortune, 6/9/97: "Business is booming, inflation is falling, jobs are plentiful, and American
           industry is way out in front. The U.S. economy is stronger than it's ever been before."
I
          Allen Sinai, one of America's top economic forecasters, 4/30/97: "Job growth is good. Real income is
           rising. Sentiment is high. Unemployment is the lowest in years. Times are good for American
           consumers. "


        Mickey Levy, chief economist, NationsBank, 2/1/97: "It's really the best of all worlds.
                                                                                               Growth at a
           healthy pace, but with the economy not overheating and continued very favorable news on
           inflation. "                                          A        n. ..1. ' I .   : Sv쬽em

       Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 8/3/96: "It's been a remarkable period of
        steady growth, low inflation and low unemployment."
