I JUST HEARD FROM JACK.  THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT ON THE HILL, SO THE LANGUAGE
SHOULD GO NOWHERE RIGHT NOW.  PLEASE DO NOT DISCUSS THIS LANGUAGE OR THE
OPTIONS WITH THE HILL OR THE AGENCIES.  YOUR REVIEW WILL STILL BE MOST HELPFUL,
BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE DISCUSSING OUTSIDE OF EXOP.  THANKS IN ADVANCE.

ALSO, THANKS A MILLION TO HRD FOR TURNING THIS AROUND SO QUICKLY.

If you have questions, please call at 5-7224.

More news to follow.

Subje"ct: URGENT -- Dra"ft legislative language for FLSA Option 2

Jack called earlier this afternoon to ask for draft language for option 2 --
the in-between compromise to place a moratorium on regulations and legislative
riders. See option 2 in attached (sent earlier today) .



There has been NO agency review (in particular the GCs from SSA, Treasury and
DOL have not seen the language) -- agencies do not know that these options are
being discussed.

Elena and Bob -- I need your keen eye on this.  I will be paging Jack
momentarily to get his guidance on this.  I will follow-up, but in the meantime
your review is appreciated.

Here is the draft language:



Thanks for your help.

                       Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) Options

Option 1:
      If an individual participating in a work experience or community service program is an
       employee (as determined by current law), the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) applies.

       -- Participants who are employees are covered by employee protection laws such as the
       FLSA, safety and health, and anti-discrimination laws.

       -- Participants who are not employees (e.g., trainees) under the FLSA, will be covered
       by other employee protection laws such as safety and health and anti-discrimination laws.

               o In addition, they will be covered by a grievance procedure that includes the
               right to a hearing within a specified time period and appeal of an adverse finding
               to a neutral State agency selected by the Governor.

      Participants in activities funded by welfare-to-work funds or T ANF cannot displace
       current employees (including a reduction in hours, wages, or benefits) or be employed in
       a job resulting from a layoff or a workforce reduction to create the vacancy or in a job that
       impairs promotional opportunities for current employees. (Senate provision)

      Regardless of "employee" status, participants in programs financed with welfare-to-work
       or T ANF funds, and their employers, shall not be covered by unemployment
       compensation and FICA taxes. Such individuals shall not be eligible for the EITC.

      Community service employment and work experience would not be listed as allowable
       activities under Welfare-to-Work.

Option 2:
      Guidance on the determination of the applicability of the FLSA to participants in
       community service or work experience programs, issued by the Department of Labor
       (DOL) in May 1997, shall remain unchanged through September 30, 1999. The DOL
       shall not issue any other regulations, interpretations, or guidance on this matter prior to
       September 30, 1999.

       -- Participants who are not employees shall be treated as in Option 1.

      No further legislative riders to determine the applicability of the FLSA to participants in
       community service or work experience programs would be permitted in either
       appropriations or authorizing language until after September 30, 1999.

      Anti-displacement provisions same as Option 1.

      Coverage of and eligibility for unemployment compensation, FICA, and the EITC same
       as Option 1.
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
Option 3:
      House provision, but sunset on September 30, 1999. Participants in work experience and
       community service programs during this period are not considered to be receiving
       compensation for work and are not entitled to a salary or work or training expenses.

      Unemployment compensation, FICA, and the EITC same as Option 1.
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
