               PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES APPAREL INDUSTRY
                          PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
                                              April 14, 1997

  TODAY, PRESIDENT CLINTON WELCOMES TO THE WHITE HOUSE THE MEMBERS
  OF THE APPAREL INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP TO ANNOUNCE A NEW AGREEMENT.
  Leaders from the footwear and apparel industry, labor, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and
  consumer groups have found common ground, agreeing to a Code of Conduct and independent
  monitoring systems that will assure Americans that the clothes and shoes they buy are made under
  decent and humane working conditions. The Partnership also agreed to recruit others in the industry
  and to develop an independent association to assure compliance and inform consumers about the Code
, and which companies comply.

 THIS AGREEMENT FOLLOWS FROM WHITE HOUSE MEETING LAST YEAR. On August
 2, 1996, the President and Vice President met with these parties to discuss the problem of sweatshops,
 consumer concerns, and the need to join together to address these issues. The parties formed a
 voluntary, industry-driven partnership that proposed to report back to the President its recommendations
 for action.

       Participants in the Partnership include: Liz Claiborne; Nike; Phillips-Van Heusen; Reebok;
        L.L. Bean; Patagonia; Tweeds; Nicole Miller; Karen Kane; UNITE; the Retail, Wholesale,
        Department Store Union; Business for Social Responsibility; the Interfaith Center on Corporate
        Responsibility; the International Labor Rights Fund; Lawyers Committee for Human Rights; the
        National Consumers League; and the RFK Memorial Center for Human Rights.

 THE PARTNERSHIP'S AGREEMENT IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND. The agreement contains
 the following components:

        A Strong Workplace Code of Conduct that companies will voluntarily adopt and require their
        contractors to adopt, which, among other things, includes:
              Prohibitions against child labor, worker abuse or harassment, and discrimination;
              The recognition of workers' rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining;
              A minimum or prevailing industry wage, a maximum 60-hour workweek, and a cap on
               mandatory overtime; and
              A safe and healthy working environment.

        Independent 텲xternal Monitors to conduct reviews of company policies and practices and to
        verify that the company is in compliance with its obligations and commitments under the Code
        of Conduct. Companies will also maintain an internal monitoring system that outlines the
        obligations each company will undertake to ensure that the Code is enforced in its facilities and
        its contractors' facilities both domestically and internationally.

        Commitment to Form an Association Over the Next Six Months that will (1) recruit new
        member companies which also will abide by the Code and implement independent monitoring;
        (2) develop a reliable, independent means to provide for public confidence that the above
        obligations are being met; and (3) develop a mechanism or seal of approval informing
        consumers about which companies abide by the Code and monitoring.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

             above obligations are being met; and

             abide by the Code and monitoring.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
