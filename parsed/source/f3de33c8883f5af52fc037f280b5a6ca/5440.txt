        Attached, for your review, is the draft memo on the urban-rural challenge
        grants.   The memo builds on language that was agreed to for the leak
        earlier this week, but adds in some detail on budget options while
        attempting to reflect that there are still some issues to be worked out
        (especially with OMB on how best to reward success in ra1s1ng
        achievement). This version has not been reviewed by OMB and NEC yet.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM: BRUCE REED

SUBJECT: URBAN AND RURAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ZONES

This initiative, which you discussed in your Town Hall meeting earlier this week, would
designate from 20 to 40 urban and rural school districts as Education Opportunity Zones. As
proposed, the zones would cost between $221 million and $320 million in FY 99 ($1.1 billion to
$1.3 billion over five years). Education Opportunity Zones would have a strong focus on standards
and accountability, and would be eligible for rewards based on improved performance.

The initiative would fund high profile demonstrations of effective approaches to expanding
opportunities for students, coupled with increased responsibility for results for schools, educators
and students themselves. High-poverty urban and rural school districts would be eligible for
additional Federal funding if(l) they adopt tough reform measures --like those in place in
Chicago -- that make administrators, principals, teachers, and students truly accountable for
success or failure, and (2) in time, show real improvements in student achievement.

To receive funds, local school districts would demonstrate how they will:

      provide students and parents with expanded choice within public education;

      hold schools accountable for helping students reach high academic standards, including
       rewarding schools that succeed and intervening in schools that fail to make progress;

      hold teachers and principals accountable for quality, including rewarding outstanding
       teachers, and implementing processes for fairly and quickly removing ineffective
       teachers.

      require students to meet academic standards at key transition points in their academic
       careers.

School districts could use Education Opportunity Zone funds to:

      provide extra help to students that need it in order to meet challenging standards, through
       after-school or Saturday tutoring programs and/or summer school.

      provide bonuses to schools that make significant gains in student achievement, and turn
       around failing schools by implementing proven reform models, providing intensive
       teacher training, building stronger partnerships between schools and parents, businesses
       and community-based organizations, or closing down failing schools and reopening them
       as charter schools.

                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


            provide needed training to teachers and principals; reward outstanding teachers by
             helping them earn certification as master teachers from the National Board for
             Professional Teaching standards and providing them with financial incentives when they
             do; and implement programs to identify low performing teachers, providing them help to
             improve, and removing them fairly and quickly ifthey don't.

      In order to successfully compete for the challenge grants, districts would be required to show
      how they will use all available funds, including other federal, state and local funds, in a
      comprehensive, coordinated manner to raise student achievement. Education Opportunity Zones
      would be allowed to use challenge grant funds for start-up and initial operating expenses
      connected with reforms, but would be required to meet an increasing share of ongoing costs with
      state, local, and other federal funds over the life of the grant.

      Budget. As proposed, 3-year competitive grants would be awarded by the Department of
      Education to 10-20 urban school districts and 10-20 rural school districts or consortia (including
      districts serving Native American students) selected as Education Opportunity Zones. Each
      urban Education Opportunity Zone would receive approximately $10-25 million in its first year,
      and each rural zone would receive from $500,000 to $5 million (for consortia).

      Each participating district would receive a declining share of federal support in years 2 and 3 to
      ensure that reforms can be sustained over the long term. Continued support in years 4 and 5
      would be contingent upon demonstrated success in raising student achievement and willingness
      to work with similar districts to help them replicate successful reforms. $16 million would be
      available each year for national leadership activities, such as supporting technical assistance,
      documenting successes, and disseminating lessons learned to urban and rural communities across
      the U.S.

            Option 1: Only one group of zones would be selected, approximately 15 urban and 15
             rural. FY 99 request: $320 million, with a five year cost (including national activities) of
             1.07 billion.

            Option 2: Two groups of zones would be selected, with approximately 10 urban and 10
             rural zones beginning in year 1 (FY 99), and then an additional 10 urban and 10 rural
             zones beginning in year 2 (FY 00). This would give some promising districts a greater
             opportunity to participate. FY 99 request: $205 million, with a five year cost of $1.31
             billion (including national activities).

      Outstanding Issues. We are still working with other offices and the Department of Education
      on some remaining issues with this initiative. First, we are developing a component that would
      create performance partnerships to enable Education Opportunity Zones to have greater
      flexibility in the use of other federal education funds as long as participating districts continue to
      meet agreed-upon performance goals. In addition, we are working to determine the best way to
      provide rewards to districts that show significant gains in achievement. (As described above,
      one possible approach is to have receipt of 4th- and 5th-year challenge grant funds entirely




           depend on showing significant gains in student achievement). Finally, we are exploring whether
           this initiative could be accomplished under some combination of existing authority under Title I
           and appropriations language, without requiring new legislative authority.



                                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
