                     14.3 MILLION NEW JOBS UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON
                                                                   January 9, 1998

. TODAY, THE LABOR DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE ECONOMY CREATED
  370,000 NEW JOBS LAST MONTH ALONE. The economy is as strong as its been in a generation.
  It is clear that President Clinton's three-part economic strategy -- reducing the deficit, investing in our
  people, and tearing down foreign barriers to American goods -- is working for America's working
  families.

          370,000 NEW JOBS LAST MONTH --14.3 MILLION NEW JOBS UNDER PRESIDENT
           CLINTON. During the Clinton Administration, the economy has added 14.3 million new jobs --
           a faster annual rate of job growth (2.5 percent per year) than any Republican Administration since
           the Roaring 1920s. The economy has added 3.2 million jobs over the past year. [Source: Based on data
           from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]


          UNEMPLOYMENT AT 4.7 PERCENT -- LOWEST QUARTERLY AVERAGE IN 27 YEARS.
          The December unemployment rate was 4.7. In the fourth quarter, the unemployment rate was
          the lowest level since 1970. The unemployment rate has been below 6 for 40 consecutive
          months and at or below 5 for 9 months now with no signs of inflationary pressures. In 1992,
          the unemployment rate was 7.5 . In 1997, the Hispanic and African American unemployment rates
          -- while above the overall unemployment rate -- were the lowest in two decades. [Source: BLS,]

          REAL WAGES RISING AGAiN. After stagnating or declining for years, real wages are rising
           again. Over the past 12 months, wages have risen 3.7 percent -- that is far faster than the two
           percent inflation rate over the past year. [Source: BLS]

          STRONG PRIVATE-SECTOR JOB GROWTH. Last month, the economy added 358,000
           private-sector jobs. Since President Clinton took office, the private sector of the economy has added
           13.3 million new jobs -- with 2.9 million jobs added in the past year. Under President Clinton, 93
           percent of the 14.3 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector -- that's a
           higher percentage than any Administration since Truman. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]

          TURNING THE CORNER IN BASIC AMERICAN INDUSTRIES. After losing 667,000 jobs in
           construction during the previous four years, more than 1.2 million new construction jobs have
           been added since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other Administration since
           Harry.S Truman was President. After losing manufacturing jobs during the 12 years before
           President Clinton took office, 575,000 new manufacturing jobs have been created in the last five
           years. After losing 35,000 jobs in the auto industry during the Bush years, we have 144,000 new
           auto jobs since President Clinton took office. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey,]

                           EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG
      Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 7/22/97: "The recent performance of the
         economy, characterized by strong growth and low inflation, has been exceptional--and better than
         most anticipated."
