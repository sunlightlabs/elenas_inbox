Yesterday I sent most of you the electronic versions of the McCain bill
and committee report released by the Commerce Committee.  (I've attached
them again below.)



The files below are not formatted like the final printed bill, i.e., the
page numbers do not correspond.  You can, however, access the bill in its
final bill format at the following web site:

http://www.senate.gov/-commerce/legis/legis.htm

(Note that this version is much, much longer -- the first 240 pages are
strike throughs of the prior version, and the bill is double spaced, so
the final bill is 669 pages long!)

I will get our print shop to make copies of the bill in its final format
-- I'll let you know when they are available.

REPORT TO ACCOMPANY S. 1415--the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking ReductionAct




                                             Purpose of the bill:


     The purpose of this bill is: (1) to prevent children from using tobacco products; (2) to more effectively
inform the public of the dangers of using tobacco products;; (3) to ensure that nicotine and tobacco
products are appropriately regulated by the Food and Drug Administration to better protect public health;
(4) to settle claims of the various states against the tobacco industry; (5) to require payments from the
industry to provide for the settlement of relevant state suits; (6) to increase the price-per-pack of cigarettes
to deter youth consumption; (7) to provide a stream of revenue to finance smoking prevention, cessation
and related health research initiatives; and, (8) to assist tobacco farmers and rural communities affected by
reductions in the volume of tobacco consumption.



Background and need for the legislation:


        The use of tobacco products poses a serious threat to public health. Health studies show that
nicotine is an addictive substance and tobacco use is harmful to the human body. In the United States,
over four hundred thousand people per year die from smoking related disease, including cancer, heart
disease and emphysema. The human and economic toll of tobacco use is enormous.              The Surgeon
General reports that tobacco use is the number one preventable cause of disease and death.
          The Secretary ofHHS estimates that smoking related health care costs exceed $45 billion per
year, including from Medicare and Medicaid, and the total economic cost of tobacco use exceed $145
billion per year, including the cost of fire damage and related injuries; absenteeism and lost productivity.


The vast majority of tobacco users (90 percent) take up the addiction in their teenage years. Four and
one-half million underage Americans use tobacco. Three thousand youth begin smoking every day, one
thousand of whom will die early from smoking related disease. The American Cancer Society calls
youth consumption of tobacco a "pediatric epidemic."
         According to the Center for Disease Control one out of three adolescents in the United States is

                                                       1
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

using tobacco by age 18. Seventy-one percent of underage smokers smoke daily. Every living Surgeon
General has signed a letter urging Congress to approve comprehensive legislation to address the public
health problems associated with tobacco use ..
        Tobacco industry documents indicate that tobacco companies have long known the adverse health
impact and addictiveness of tobacco use, and, nevertheless, have actively marketed to children and teens.
Forty-one states have filed suit against the tobacco industry to recover damages.       On June 20,1997, the
state attorneys general, plaintiff attorneys and the industry reached an agreement in principle to settle state
and other civil suits. Under the settlement, the industry would agree to tobacco advertising and marketing
restrictions; nicotine and tobacco products would be submitted to FDA regulation; the industry would
agree to meet youth tobacco use reduction targets and pay assessments for non-attainment of such targets;
and the industry would pay up to $368 billion over the next 25 years. In return, under the June 20th
agreement, the industry would receive certain limitations on liability.
The June 20th agreement cannot take effect without enactment of implementing legislation, and the
execution of a National Protocol and state consent decrees. The protocol and consent decrees would bind
the industry to obligations under the agreement that, due to constitutional limitations, may not be imposed
on the industry without their consent to the waiver of certain constitutional rights.
        The National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act mirrors the structural framework
of the June 20th agreement, although there are significant differences. In general, the bill increases industry
payments from $368 billion over 25 years to $516 billion; approximately doubles the penalties the
industry would pay for failure to attain targets for the reduction of youth tobacco use; and bolsters FDA
regulatory authority over nicotine and tobacco products. The bill provides a yearly civil liability cap; settles
only state and local government suits and the Castano class action claims based on tobacco addiction and
dependency, and does not restrict the right of groups or individuals to sue and receive compensation from
the industry.


                                             Legislative History
        At least five comprehensive tobacco policy bills have been introduced in the Senate during the
105th Congress .. The omnibus nature of these measures, including legislation to implement the June 20th
Agreement, contained provisions within the jurisdiction of various Senate Committees.



                                                       2
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

          The multi-jurisdictional nature of comprehensive tobacco legislation posed procedural and
logistical difficulties for the Senate in determining how, and in what form, omnibus legislation would be
reported to the full Senate. Legislation to implement the comprehensive tobacco settlement reached
between state Attorneys General and the tobacco industry contained provisions that would
customarily fall under the legislative jurisdiction of various Senate Committees including the
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, the Labor and Human Resources
Committee, the Finance Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Agriculture Committee, the
Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Indian Mfairs Committee.                   In order to
ensure that a single comprehensive and bipartisan tobacco bill would be reported to the full
Senate in a timely manner, the Senate Commerce Committee was selected to develop and report
such a bill.    Therefore, the Commerce Committee was required to address issues not otherwise
within the scope of the Committee.         The chairmen of the other directly relevant committees
were subsequently invited to testify about their priorities for a tobacco bill before the Commerce
Committee, as were other interested Senators.
          To fulfill its charge of dealing with this comprehensive legislation, the Committee conducted ten
hearings concerning proposed tobacco legislation.    Each of those hearings is summarized below


Hearing I:     Iuly 29, 1997


          The first full committee hearing to begin examination of the Global Settlement of Tobacco
Litigation was held on July 29, 1997.

Hon. Hubert H. Humphrey III, Attorney General of Minnesota
Hon. Grant Woods, Attorney General of Arizona
Hon. Christine Gregoire, Attorney General of Washington
Hon. Mike Moore, Attorney General of Mississippi


                                                     PANEL I
        The Co-Chairs of The Advisory Committee on Tobacco Policy and Public Health, Dr. C. Everett
Koop and Dr. David A. Kessler, asked Congress to act urgently to enact legislation to protect the American
people from smoking-related illnesses.      They indicated there are 50 million tobacco "addicts" in this
country, that each day 3,000 new children become addicted, and that one-third of them will die
prematurely from smoking related disease. They also advised that the proposed tobacco settlement should
be strengthened to meet public health goals, and that no special liability protections should be afforded to
the industry.
                                                    PANEL II
        Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III urged Congress to pass tobacco legislation.              He agreed
with Dr. Koop's      and Dr. Kessler's proposals to strengthen the tobacco settlement and requested that
Congress subpoena key tobacco documents that show that the tobacco industry has lied to Congress since
the 1960s.
        Attorney General Grant Woods stated that he believed that the negotiated tobacco settlement was
an excellent agreement.     He warned that it may not be possible to strengthen tobacco legislation due to
constitutional limitations and the need for consent to waive constitutional rights.
        Attorney General Christine Gregoire testified that the tobacco settlement was based on the need to
prevent tobacco sales to children, and change the corporate culture of the tobacco industry to prevent
tobacco advertising aimed at children.
        Attorney General Mike Moore gave a background to the negotiations and purpose of the tobacco
agreement.      He also discussed the advertising and liability provisions of the settlement.


Hearing II:     September 16, 1997
        The committee held its second hearing on September 16, 1997.           The hearing examined the effect

of advertising and marketing on children and explored the advertising restrictions included in the tobacco
settlement.

Panel II
Dr. Joseph DiFranza, University of Massachusetts Medical Center
Dr. Alfred Munzer, Past President of the American Lung Association
Mr. D. Scott Wise, Partner, Davis, Polk & Wardwell


                                                   PANEL I
          Shirley Igo, Vice President for Legislation, National Parent Teacher Association, testified that
tobacco advertising is very influential in convincing children to start smoking.   She also stated the National
PTA supported only restrictions on advertising directed to children and youth to be sensitive to the First
Amendment considerations.
          Matthew Myers, Executive Vice-President for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,          agreed that
tobacco marketing and advertising is a major cause of increased smoking among youth.          He also believed
that the tobacco settlement between the attorneys general and the tobacco industry should be strengthened
to restrict marketing and advertising to children and include a comprehensive program to reduce youth
smoking.
                                                   PANEL II
           Dr. Joseph DiFranza testified on the behalf of the non-profit organization Stop Teenage Addiction
to Smoking (STAT).        He said that there has been a reduction in teen smoking where there is strong
 enforcement of community laws that prohibit tobacco sales to children.      He also alleged that the tobacco
industry has played a key role in reducing the ability of communities to enforce their anti-teen smoking
 laws.
           Dr. Alfred Munzer, Past President of the American Lung Association, testified that he did not



                                                        5
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

support the proposed tobacco settlement because it failed to achieve meaningful public health protections.
He also stated that the provisions of the tobacco settlement concerning tobacco advertising will not inhibit
the tobacco industry's ability to appeal to teenagers.
        D. Scott Wise, a partner with Davis, Polk, and Wardwell who has represented major tobacco
companies, stated that provisions of the tobacco settlement concerning youth smoking were based on
restrictions proposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in their rule, issued in 1996,
concerning tobacco.     Mr. Wise noted the agreement included every restriction the FDA proposed and
added even more restrictions.     He believes that these restrictions are strong enough to significantly
diminish the allure and access to tobacco products by youth.


Hearing- III:   October 9, 1997
        The committee held its third hearing on October 9, 1997.          The hearing examined the potential
impact of the proposed tobacco settlement on public health.


                                                 WITNESSES
Dr. John Seffrin, CEO, American Cancer Society
Dr. Ronald M. Davis, Chair, Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association
Mr. Cass Wheeler, CEO, American Heart Association


        Dr. John Seffrin, the Chief Executive Officer of the American Cancer Society, stated that tobacco
causes the largest number of preventable deaths in our country.        It also annually costs the U.S. economy
$100 billion of which $22 billion comes from taxpayers to pay for treating smokers through Medicare,
Medicaid, and V A programs.       He also said that tobacco should be considered a "pediatric" disease,
because ninety percent of all smokers start by age 18.       He urged strong legislation to reduce the incidence
of smoking and tobacco use.
        Dr. Ronald M. Davis, Chair of the American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs,
testified that the proposed tobacco settlement is a promising beginning to meeting public health goals of
reduced smoking.      However, he suggested that the FDA should have more authority over tobacco
products and the Look Back program (assessments on the industry for non-attainment of youth smoking

reduction targets) should be redesigned to provide further incentives for the tobacco companies to reduce

underage tobacco use.
        M. Cass Wheeler, Chief Staff Executive Officer of the American Heart Association, agreed with
earlier testimony that tobacco advertising played an important role in the increase in youth smoking.    He
supported measures to encourage the tobacco industry to stop marketing and promoting tobacco to

children.


Hearing IV:       February 24, 1998
        At the Committee's fourth hearing, the chairmen of the five major tobacco companies testified.

            Geoffrey C. Bible, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Philip Morris Companies, testified

over tobacco policy, and that a new era of responsible management was at the helm.
        N.G. Brookes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Brown and Williamson Tobacco
Corporation agreed with Mr. Bible that the legislation offered an opportunity to achieve public health goals,
and asked that the Committee to pursue legislation that will benefit the American people, rather than
enacting legislation that would seek to punish the tobacco companies.
        Steven F. Goldstone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of RJR Nabisco, Inc., stated that he

believed the proposed settlement was an appropriate balance between the ability of the tobacco companies
to sell a legal product and the country to establish a public health policy that educates people about health
issues concerning tobacco products.

            Laurence A. Tisch, Co-Chairman of the Board and Co-CEO, Loews Corporation, said that the



                                                       7
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

tobacco settlement was a realistic plan to deal with cigarette smoking and other forms of tobacco use.
          Vincent A. Gierer, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of UST Inc., also agreed that the
tobacco settlement was a comprehensive approach to resolving the different concerns about tobacco
products.       He warned that if the settlement was addressed in a piecemeal fashion, it might not achieve the
shared goals of reducing youth access to tobacco products and achieving other public health objectives.
Hearing V: February 26, 1998
          The committee held a fifth hearing on February 26, 1998.         The hearing addressed the issue of
civil liability for tobacco related harm.

          Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, stated his support
for comprehensive tobacco legislation largely based on the proposed tobacco settlement.            He warned that
the advertising restrictions would violate the First Amendment unless they are based on consent.          He
urged the committee to find a constitutional way to obtain that consent and thus to achieve these
restrictions.

                                                      PANEL II
            Attorney General Mike Moore testified that the civil liability provisions play an important part in
the proposed agreement as they are needed to get the tobacco companies to agree to waive their
constitutional rights, among them, restrictions on their rights to advertise.
            Attorney General Carla Stovall said that she felt that the benefits of the tobacco settlement
outweighed the concerns about it and urged Congress to support legislation to enact the agreement.
            Attorney General Gale Norton explained the provisions of the tobacco settlement concerning civil
liability and related issues.


                                                     PANEL III
            Stanley M. Chesley, of Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley Co., L.P.A., explained that the
tobacco settlement only settled state and local cases and the Castano class action.        Although existing class
actions would be decertified, individuals could still pursue their individual claims for smoking related
injuries.
            Eugene I. Pavalon, former President of the Association of Trial lawyers of America, said that the
liability provisions are inadequate for those injured by tobacco companies, and urged that any legislation
should include direct compensation to victims and meaningful penalties on the industry.
            Professor Kris Kobach, Professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Missouri in Kansas
City stated that congressional interference with the contracts between the States and their attorneys,
concerning attorney's fees, would be unconstitutional and likely would be invalidated in the court if
challenged.
            Richard F. Scruggs, the Senior Partner in the law firm Scruggs, Millette, Lawson, Bozeman &
Dent, P.A.,      testified that restricting class actions against the tobacco industry is a protection for individual
plaintiffs because the restriction prevents the industry from collusively settling a class action and thereby
evade liability to individual victims.

          Senator Connie Mack testified that the most effective way to improve the health of American
citizens is for the Congress to pass bipartisan legislation based on a consensual agreement between the
tobacco companies and the American people.


                                                  PANEL II
           FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky addressed proposed restrictions on the advertising, marketing and
sale of tobacco products, as well as possible areas for FTC involvement.    He also indicated an antitrust
exemption was not necessary to implement proposed settlement.
          Michael Eriksen, an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, discussed the
problem of tobacco use by youth and ways to address it.      According to Dr. Eriksen, tobacco use is the

                                                  PANEL III


        Matthew Myers, from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, argued that congressional action is
needed to insure that at least one federal agency has the authority to eliminate those forms of tobacco
advertising that have the greatest impact on children.    Specifically, Mr. Myers argued that it would not be
difficult to amend Section 520(e) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to clarify that this section enables
the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco advertising.
        Northeastern University School of Law Professor Richard Daynard testified that the contempla~ed
advertising restrictions for tobacco products could be constitutionally imposed without the consent of the
tobacco industry.   Professor Daynard argued that Congress has the power to directly regulate the tobacco
industry's commercial advertising.
         The general counsel to the American Association of Advertising Agencies, David Versfelt,
expressed concern that Congress might statutorily enact the unprecedented, sweeping advertising restrictions
in the Proposed Settlement.       Mr. Versfelt testified that such restrictions were not Constitutional and that
Congressional imposition of content and format based commercial speech restrictions would also establish
unfortunate precedents that go far beyond the' subject of tobacco advertising.
        Mr. Martin Redish, the Louis and Harriet Ancel Professor of Law and Public Policy at
Northwestern University, evaluated the constitutionality of the suppression or restriction of tobacco
advertising.   Dr. Redish testified that, in his view, governmental restriction of tobacco advertising violates
fundamental precepts underlying the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, as well as established
Supreme Court doctrine concerning the protection of commercial speech.


Hearing VII: March Il, 1998
        The committee held its seventh hearing on March Il, 1998.          At the hearing the Committee heard
testimony from Senators concerning the various bills introduced concerning the tobacco settlement.

Hon. Max Baucus, U.S. Senator, Montana
Hon. Orrin G. Hatch, U.S. Senator, Utah
Hon. John H. Chaffee, U.S. Senator, Rhode Island
Hon. Kent Conrad, U.S. Senator, North Dakota


        Senator Dick Lugar, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry,
testified that his support for tobacco legislation will be guided by three basic principles: (1) increasing the
price per pack of cigarettes by at least $1.50; (2) opposing any limitation on the right of any individual or
group to seek legal redress; and (3) his belief that it is simply wrong for the federal government to support
tobacco farming, marketing, and warehousing.
        Senator Max Baucus testified that the ultimate goals of Congress for national tobacco policy should
be to: (1) protect kids from a product that is harmful to them; (2) make tobacco less available to kids; and
(3) dedicate payments from the tobacco industry toward children including child care, child healthcare,
education and programs to stop children from smoking).
        Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, testified in support
of S. 1530, the Placing Restraints on Tobacco's Endangerment of Children and Teens Act (PROTECT)
Act.   Senator Hatch said his legislation is comprehensive and has worked through many of the tough
questions associated with devising a national anti-tobacco program that would work well.         He urged the
Committee to use S. 1530 as a starting point in drafting legislation.
        Senator John H. Chaffee, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works,
testified on Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS).         According to the Senator, the ETS exposures of most
concern are beyond the reach of the federal government.       Those most vulnerable to ETS are children and
non-smoking adults that live with smokers.     ETS, better known as second-hand smoke, creates public
health and policy dilemmas of its own because one cannot address ETS exposure in private homes but this
is where the most significant exposures occur.
        Senator Kent Conrad explained that the purpose of the bill he introduced, S. 1638, the Healthy
Kids Act, is to protect children, promote the public health, help tobacco farmers, resolve Federal, State and

          Deputy FDA Commissioner BiIl Schultz discussed three tobacco issues of concern to the FDA: (1)
the Agency's tobacco program as formulated through regulation; (2) the Administration's position on
tobacco legislation; and (3) some of the issues relevant to FDA's authority raised by pending bills..   Mr.
Schultz emphasized that the FDA and the Administration strongly support comprehensive tobacco
legislation which would significantly reduce young people's tobacco use and meet the other goals
announced by the President.
          Dr. Gregory N. Connolly is the Director of the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program with the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health.     He testified on the health risk to consumers of spit     tobacco

retail establishments.   The Association seeks workable restrictions on tobacco access that reflect practical
aspects of retailing. Mr. Columbus recommended that any regulations on the sale or advertisement of

tobacco products at retail stores be equally and uniformly applied to all types of retailers that sell tobacco

products.


                                                   PANEL II

           Treasury Deputy Secretary Lawrence Summers and Deputy Assistant Secretary Gruber testified on
the Administration's budget proposal calling for a $UO increase in the price per pack of cigarettes.
Secretary Summers also addressed concerns that comprehensive tobacco legislation, in line with the
President's core principles, would impose unmanageable adjustment costs on tobacco suppliers and the
tobacco industry as a whole.     Secretary Summers concluded that the President's proposal would not inflict
an undue financial burden on the tobacco industry and that it would not push the industry into bankruptcy.


                                                   PANEL II
            Floyd Abrams, a partner with Cahill Gordon & Reindel, testified on the First Amendment issues
concerning limitations of tobacco advertising.    Mr. Abrams indicated that given existing Supreme Court
precedent, it is unlikely that the Food and Drug Administration's proposed regulations on advertising could
survive First Amendment scrutiny.      Mr. Abrams also indicated that the advertising restrictions contained in
the Proposed Settlement could not be constitutionaly imposed on the tobacco companies without their
consent.
           Scott R. Strand, Deputy Counsel for the Minnesota State Attorney General's office, stated that
Congress could impose strong restrictions on tobacco advertising without the consent of the tobacco
industry.     Mr. Strand also said that advertising restrictions achieved through consent agreements would not
work; in part, due to the difficulty of enforcing such agreements.   Mr. Strand also encouraged Congress to
adopt strong youth smoking reduction standards.

                     TITLE I-REGULATION OF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY


                      Subtitle A-Jurisdiction of Food and Drug Administration
I. Introduction and Summary

        Title I, Subtitle A of this bill provides explicit authority to the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to regulate tobacco products. To ensure that the August 28,1996 regulations restricting the access
to and promotion of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to children and adolescents go into effect, section
901 deems FDA's regulations lawful and lawfully promulgated under this bill.         The remainder of Subtitle
A addresses the Secretary's statutory authority to regulate tobacco products.     Tobacco products raise
different public health issues than medical devices regulated under Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). While maintaining to the greatest extent practical the full range of authorities
that the Secretary and FDA would have exercised over these products as devices, the bill modifies and
adapts certain FDCA device authorities so that they are more appropriate to     a~dress   the unique problems
encountered in regulating tobacco products. Therefore, the Committee believes that it is appropriate to
create a separate chapter of the FDCA for the regulation of tobacco products.
        New Chapter IX is created to provide for comprehensive regulation of tobacco products and
incorporates almost all of the authorities available to the Secretary in regulating devices, including the
authority to: (1) address the adulteration or misbranding of a product, (2) require manufacturers to register



                                                      19
                                                                 Hex·Dump Conversion

and list their products, (3) restrict the sale, distribution, and use of a product, (4) require manufacturers to
comply with "good manufacturing practice" requirements, (5) require manufacturers to comply with
performance standards, (6) require manufacturers of novel products to obtain premarket approval, (7)
require manufacturers to notify users of unreasonable risks posed by a product, (8) require manufacturers
to recall products associated with unusually serious risks, (9) require manufacturers to maintain records
and make reports, and (10) require manufacturers to conduct postmarket surveillance, where appropriate.
Other provisions of the bill extend to tobacco products FDA's authority to investigate and prosecute
violations of the FDCA.
           Some of the medical device authorities have, however, been modified to reflect the special
concerns raised by the regulation of tobacco products. For example, in regulating devices under Chapter
V, the Secretary must determine whether the regulatory actions taken will "provide reasonable assurance of
the safety and effectiveness" of the device. Under the provisions of Chapter IX, this standard has been
replaced with the requirement, to be used only for tobacco products, that the Secretary find that
regulations and other requirements imposed on tobacco products "are appropriate for the protection of the .
public health." This change makes explicit FDA's authority to consider, among other things, the adverse
consequences that could result from removal of a product that is dangerous but to which millions of
Americans are addicted.      In addition, section 906(d), which like all of Chapter IX does not affect other

products regulated under the Act, makes explicit the Secretary's authority to restrict the advertising and
promotion of tobacco products as part of a regulation restricting the sale, distribution, and use of such a
product.     That provision also prohibits the Secretary from restricting tobacco products to prescription use.
   In addition, a special procedure is established for notifying Congress regarding any restriction on the

sale of tobacco products in retail outlets. Because of the importance of any such decision by the Secretary,
the committee strongly believes that Congress should have adequate opportunity, prior to implementation
of any such restriction, to review such a decision and to enact legislation to override it. Therefore, the
President must notify Congress that such a restriction has been issued and implementation of any such
restriction is delayed for at least two years.
           Chapter IX also omits a small number of device authorities that are unnecessary, duplicative, or
not well-suited to the regulation of tobacco products.      For example, Chapter IX does not require the
Secretary to classify tobacco products, although it preserves the Secretary's authority to use all of the



                                                       20
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

authorities available for each class (i.e., general controls, special controls, and premarket approval).

Chapter IX contains no counterpart to section 516 of the FDCA, which authorizes FDA to ban devices that

present "a substantial risk of illness and injury." A special procedure is established under section 907 for
notifying Congress regarding the issuance of any performance standard that eliminates nicotine or specific
categories of tobacco products. Because of the importance of any such decision, the committee strongly
believes that Congress should have adequate opportunity, prior to implementation of any such performance
standard, to review such a decision and to enact legislation to override it. Therefore, the President must
notify Congress that such a performance standard has been issued and implementation of any such
performance standard is delayed for at least two years. Chapter IX also omits provisions analogous to

sections 502(j), 518(b), (c), 519(b), (c), (e), 520(b), (h), (j), (m), and makes small changes in a number of
other provisions intended to tailor these provisions to the needs of regulating tobacco products.

        Chapter IX includes certain new provisions that grant the Secretary explicit authority to undertake

regulatory measures particularly relevant to tobacco regulation. For example, section 904 specifically
requires manufacturers to submit to the Secretary information about (1) the ingredients, components, and

substances in their products, (2) the content, delivery, and form of nicotine in their products, and (3) their
research on the health, behavioral, or physiologic effects of tobacco products and their constituents, on

reductions in risk associated with available technology, and on the marketing of tobacco products. Section
913 imposes certain requirements on manufacturers who wish to market "reduced risk" tobacco products.
        The bill creates a separate chapter for tobacco products, and thus, expressly directs the Secretary to

maintain a distinct regulatory program for tobacco products. However, the Secretary may follow
precedents involving, decisions under, and interpretations of, comparable provisions governing devices

under Chapter V to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate for tobacco products.


II. Definitions
        Subtitle A defines "tobacco product" for purposes of the FDCA as any product made or derived

from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a
tobacco product (except for raw materials other than tobacco used in manufacturing a component, part, or
accessory of a tobacco product). This definition potentially encompasses the full range of tobacco

products marketed in the United States. As described below in section III of this report, however, the



                                                      21
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


Secretary's authority to regulate tobacco products under Chapter IX is limited to those products
specifically covered by regulations issued by the Secretary.    Current regulations cover only cigarettes and

smokeless tobacco products.


III. FDA Authority over Tobacco Products
         The Committee expects that the Secretary will regulate tobacco products exclusively under
Chapter IX, and any general provisions of the FDCA that encompass tobacco products, except where: (1)
they are intended for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease within the meaning of
section 201 (g)(I)(B) or (h)(2) of the FDCA, or (2) a health claim is made for them within the meaning of

section 20 1(g)(l)(C) or (h)(3) of the FDCA.     Sections 201 (g)(l)(B) and © are relevant portions of the

definition of "drug" under the FDCA, and sections 201 (h)(2) and (3) are corresponding portions of the
definition of "device" under the FDCA. This provision would not limit FDA's traditional authority to

regulate as a drug or device, for example, a cigarette marketed to assist smoking cessation, or to treat

Parkinson's disease or depression.    See,~,    United States v. 354 Bulk Cartons ... Trim Reducing-Aid
Cigarettes, 178 F. Supp. 847,851 (D.N.J. 1959).       The term "health claim" as used in this provision is not
intended to relate to, or to affect in any way, the agency's authority to regulate health claims for food.
        Section 901(b) provides that Chapter IX shall apply to all tobacco products subject to 21 CFR part

897 (the regulations issued on August 28,1996), and to any other tobacco products that the Secretary

deems to be subject to Chapter IX by regulation.     Cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are
currently covered by part 897, and are thus immediately subject to regulation under Chapter IX. To
regulate other categories of tobacco product, the Secretary must issue regulations making them subject to

Chapter IX.
        As stated above, the bill incorporates the provisions of part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal

Regulations, issued by the Secretary as a final rule on August 28, 1996, and therefore the Committee does
not intend the Secretary to repromulgate these regulations. The bill therefore includes section 901 ( c),

which deems the regulations lawful and lawfully enacted pursuant to the new chapter of the FDCA for
tobacco products. The Secretary may choose to recodify these regulations in a different part of title 21,

Code of Federal Regulations.
        Section 901(d)(I) clarifies that nothing in chapter IX shall be construed to affect the regulation of



                                                      22
                                                              Hex-Dump ConversIon


drugs and devices under chapter V that are nDt tDbaccD products under the FDCA. SectiDn 901(d)(2)

prDvides that chapter IX shall nDt apply tD tDbaccD leaf that is nDt in the pDssessiDn of the manufacturer, Dr

tD   producers .of tDbaccD leaf, including tDbaccD grDwers, tDbaccD warehDuses, and tDbaccD grDwer

cDDperatives, and that FDA emplDyees may nDt enter DntD a farm .owned by a producer .of tDbaccD leaf

withDut the producer's written CDnsent. HDwever, if the producer DftDbaccD leaf is alsD a tDbaccD product

manufacturer Dr within the cDntrol .of a manufacturer, then the grDwer will be subject tD this chapter as a

manufacturer. The bill alsDprovides that chapter IX may nDt be cDnstrued tD grant the Secretary authDrity

tD   prDmulgate regulatiDns affecting the productiDn .of tDbaccD leaf Dr a prDducer, .other than activities by a

manufacturer affecting prDductiDn. This prDvisiDn dDes nDt alter the Secretary's authDrity under the

FDCA .over tDbaccD manufacturers, including the Secretary's ability, through perfDrmance standards and

.other statutDry authDrities, tD require mDdificatiDns tD tDbaccD prDducts.

IV. Standard .of Review .of Certain RegulatDry ActiDns under Chapter IX

          In regulating devices, the Secretary may undertake certain regulatDry actiDns .only if the Secretary

finds that the actiDn will "provide reasDnable assurance .of the safety and effectiveness" .of the device.

Meeting these standards fDr tDbaccD products requires taking intD aCCDunt factDrs nDt .ordinarily considered

when regulating devices. FDr example, FDA in develDping the tDbaccD regulatiDns acknDwledged that in

impDsing restrictiDns .on the availability .of tDbaccD products, it is necessary tD cDnsider such factDrs as the

develDpment .of a black market, Dr the risk tD addicted users .of precipitDus withdrawal.      Similarly, in

allDwing the sale .of nDvel tDbaccD products likely tD be perceived as safer than cDnventiDnal tDbaccD

products, it may be apprDpriate tD cDnsider the likelihDDd that such prDducts will encDurage mDre YDung

peDple tD use tDbaccD Dr discDurage current users from quitting. The CDmmittee believes that such factDrs

can mDre readily be taken intD cDnsideratiDn under the standard adDpted in chapter IX.

          In additiDn, reaching the cDnclusiDn that a particular regulatDry measure will prDvide a reasDnable

assurance .of the safety and effectiveness .of a tDbaccD product may create cDntrDversy. TherefDre, under

the prDvisiDns .of Chapter IX, wherever a reasDnable assurance .of safety and effectiveness was required tD

take actiDn under the device authDrities, this standard has been replaced with the requirement that the

Secretary find that regulatiDns impDsed .on a tDbaccD prDduct "are appropriate for the prDtectiDn .of the

public health." In making this finding, the Secretary is directed tD cDnsider the risks and benefits tD the

pDpulatiDn as a whDle, including users and nDnusers .of the tDbaccD prDduct, and taking intD aCCDunt the



                                                        23
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

increased or decreased likelihood that (1) existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products,
and (2) those who do not use tobacco products will initiate use. This change clarifies that the Secretary
need not find that a regulatory measure provides for the absolute safety of tobacco products, and that the
Secretary may weigh a variety of consequences resulting from possible new regulations on tobacco
products, including the use of contraband products and the development of black markets, and may
consider the effects of the regulation on both users and nonusers of the products. The committee does not
intend that this standard be applied to any other product regulated under the Act.


V.      The Provisions of Chapter IX
section 902, Adulteration
        The bill incorporates adulteration provisions that track
adulteration provisions for devices that are relevant to the
regulation of tobacco products under chapter IX (section 501(a) (1),
(a) (2) (A),       (a) (3),     (e),    (f),     (h), and (I)).            Minor modifications
were made to conform the provisions to the requirements under the
relevant chapter IX provisions.                         In addition, section 902(a) (1)
includes products that are "otherwise contaminated by any poisonous
or deleterious substance which may render the product injurious to
health" to make clear that a tobacco product that contains
contamination by something other than a filthy, putrid, or decomposed
substance is adulterated under this section.


Section 903, Misbranding
        The bill incorporates misbranding provisions that track
misbranding provisions for devices that are relevant to the
regulation of tobacco products under chapter IX (section 502(a),
(b),    (c),    (e),     (f),    (0),    (q),    (r),    (s),     (t)).      Minor modifications
were made to conform the provisions to the requirements under the
relevant chapter IX provisions.                         In addition, section 903(a) (4),


                                                    24
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


which authorizes the Secretary to specify by regulation the
established name of a tobacco product and requires the established
name to appear on the product's label, employs simplified language
that is consistent with the regulation at part 897 establishing the
established names of tobacco products subject to the provisions of
part 897.   Section 903 (a) (5) , which authorizes the Secretary to issue
regulations requiring adequate directions for use and adequate
warnings against use by children, has also been simplified.                  Sections
903(a) (7) and 903(a) (8) apply to all tobacco products, and are not
limited to tobacco products that are subject to regulations
promulgated under section 906 (d).        Section 903 (a) (8) , which is based
on section 502(r), deems tobacco product advertising misbranded
unless it contains, among other items,           "a brief statement of the
uses of the tobacco product."     Section 903(b) authorizes the
Secretary to require by regulation the prior approval of statements
made on the label of a tobacco product, and explicitly states that
no regulation issued under this subsection may require the prior
approval by the Secretary of the content of any advertisement.                    The
remainder of section 903(b)    tracks section 502(r).


section 904, Submission of Health Information to the Secretary
     The bill requires each manufacturer or importer of tobacco
products, or their agents, to submit to the Secretary, within 6 months
of the date of enactment and annually thereafter,                  information
concerning their products and all documents related to research
conducted on, or involving the use of, those products.                      Similar
information must be submitted at least 90 days before the marketing
of a new product not on the market as of the date of enactment.
A manufacturer must also notify the Secretary within 60 days of the


                                     25
                                              Hex-Oump Conversion

time a manufacturer adds a new additive, modifies the amount of an
existing additive or of the nicotine content, delivery, or form,
or eliminates an additive.           The purpose of this provision is to
clarify the Secretary's authority to obtain information useful in
assessing the health risks of tobacco products, including their
addictiveness, and in understanding how these products are being
marketed.      This section is intended to be in addition to, and separate
from,    the requirements for ingredient disclosure under section 7
of the Federal Cigarette and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1335a).


Section 905, Registration of producers of tobacco products
        Subsections (a)   -    (g) of section 905 track subsections (a)
(f),    (h)   of section 510.      Minor changes were made to conform the
provisions to the requirements in chapter IX.


        Report preceding introduction into interstate commerce of
certain tobacco products:          Sections 905(j) and 910 adopt the
substantial equivalence provisions of sections 510(k), 513(I) and
515(b), with certain modifications.              Section 905(j) is analogous
to section 510(k), which requires a manufacturer of a new device
to notify the Secretary at least 90 days before beginning to market
the new device and to state the basis for the manufacturer's
determination that the new device is substantially equivalent to
an already marketed device.         Section 905(j) differs in two respects
from section 510(k).          First, section 905(j) requires that the
already-marketed tobacco product have been commercially marketed
as of August 11, 1995, the date of the issuance of FDA's proposed
tobacco regulations.          Test marketing before that date is not
sufficient to satisfy this requirement.                 Within six months after


                                       26
                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

enactment of the bill, persons who, before enactment of this bill,
introduced into or delivered for introduction into interstate
commerce for commercial distribution a tobacco product intended for
human use that was not commercially marketed (other than for test
marketing) in the United States as of August 11, 1995, are required
to submit a report under this subsection to the Secretary if that
tobacco product continues to be marketed in the United States.
Second, section 905 (j) requires that the Secretary issue regulations
defining the applicability of that section.            The Committee is aware
that FDA's regulations under Part 897 do not appear to contemplate
510(k) submissions, at least for minor changes to existing tobacco
products.   Nothing in the bill restricts the Secretary's discretion
to determine when and for what types of new products a 905(j)
submission might be appropriate.         The Committee expects that the
Secretary will promptly issue guidance to the industry on when such
submissions are needed for products introduced between August 11,
1995, and the date of enactment of this bill.               Section 910, which
governs premarket review and is discussed below, defines "substantial
equivalence."


Section 906, General Provisions Respecting Control of Tobacco
Products
     Section 906 addresses general issues respecting control of
tobacco products.   These provisions incorporate subsections of
section 520 that are appropriate for the regulation of tobacco
products.   Subsections (a), (b),    (c), and (g) of section 906, which
relate to (1) the applicability of particular tobacco product
requirements that are inconsistent with requirements imposed under
section 906(d), 907, or 910,   (2) notices and findings,             (3) trade


                                    27
                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

secret information, and (4) research and development, track the
parallel provisions in section 520 (subsections (a),                    (b),   (c), and
(k) ) .



          Restrictions: section 906(d) is the authority that parallels
section 520(e), which is the statutory basis for the regulations
restricting the sale and distribution of cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco codified in part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations.
 Subsection (d) clarifies that-the Secretary may by regulation
require that a tobacco product be restricted to sale, distribution,
or use upon such conditions, including restrictions on the access
to, and the advertising and promotion of the tobacco product, if
the Secretary determines that such regulation would be appropriate
for the protection of the public health.             The bill includes factors
that are to be taken into account in making a finding as to whether
the restriction is appropriate for the protection of the public
health.      Under the bill, the Secretary may not                require that the
sale or distribution of a tobacco product be limited to the written
or oral authorization of a practitioner licensed by law to prescribe
medical products.      Because of the importance of any decision by the
Secretary to restrict the sale of any class of tobacco products on
the market on the date of enactment of this bill to specific categories
of retail outlets, it is appropriate for Congress to have the
opportunity to review such a decision and enact legislation to
override it.       Therefore, any such restriction may not take effect
before a date that is two years after the President notifies Congress
that a final regulation imposing the restriction has been issued.


          Good manufacturing practice requirements:              Section 906(e) authorizes



                                      28
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

the Secretary to promulgate regulations requiring that the methods used in, and the facilities and
controls used for, the manufacture, pre-production design validation (including a process to
assess the performance of a tobacco product packing, storage, and installation of a tobacco
product conform to current good manufacturing practice, as prescribed in such regulations, to
assure that the public health is protected and that the tobacco product is in compliance with this
chapter. This provision tracks section 520(f), the device provision for good manufacturing
practice requirements.      The bill makes explicit that the Secretary has the authority to grant
either temporary or permanent exemptions or variances from a requirement.                  As discussed in
the context of section 915, the bill establishes a single tobacco product advisory committee to
perform the duties assigned to separate advisory committees that are established under various
provisions in device law, including 520(f). Thus, the advisory committee established under
section 915 will be afforded an opportunity to submit recommendations with respect to
regulations proposed to be promulgated under this subsection.              In addition, the Secretary may
refer petitions for exemptions or variances to the advisory committee for recommendation.


        Investigational use exemption: Section 906(f) provides the Secretary with authority to
exempt tobacco products intended for investigational use from some or all of the provisions of
chapter IX under such conditions as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation.                Because of the
unique circumstances under which a tobacco product would likely be intended for investigational
use, the bill allows the Secretary broad discretion to develop regulations appropriate for the
investigational use of tobacco products.


Section 907, Performance Standards
        The bill authorizes the Secretary to promulgate performance standards if the Secretary determines
that a standard is appropriate for protection of the public health. This authority is the same as that in
section 514, but makes explicit the Secretary's existing authority to reduce or eliminate nicotine or other
harmful components pursuant to a performance standard. Because of the importance of any decision by
the Secretary to eliminate all cigarettes, all smokeless tobacco products, or any similar class of tobacco
products, or to require the reduction of nicotine yields to of a tobacco product to zero, it is appropriate for



                                                      29
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

Congress to have the opportunity to review such a decision and enact legislation to override it. Therefore,
any such standard may not take effect before a date that is two years after the President notifies Congress
that a final regulation imposing the restriction has been issued. As noted above, the bill establishes a
single tobacco product advisory committee to perform the duties assigned to separate advisory
committees that are established under various provisions in device law, including section 514.
The bill authorizes the Secretary to refer proposed regulations respecting performance
standards to the advisory committee established under section 915 for a report and
recommendation with respect to matters involved in the proposed regulation that require the
exercise of scientific judgement.


Section 908, Notification and other remedies
        The bill contains provisions that adopt the notification requirements and certain other remedies of
section S18. Section 908(a), which permits the Secretary to require notification to users and other
appropriate persons if such notification is necessary to eliminate an unreasonable risk of substantial harm
to the public health, is the same as section SI8(a). Likewise, section 908(b) parallels section SI8(d),
which makes clear that compliance with a notification order does not relieve persons from liability under
Federal or State law. The bill does not incorporate the repair and reimbursement provisions of SI8(b) and
© because they are not required for the regulation of tobacco products. Section 908© provides the
Secretary with the authority to issue cease and desist orders and to order recalls of particular tobacco
products where the Secretary finds that a tobacco product contains a manufacturing or other defect that is
not ordinarily contained in tobacco products on the market and would cause serious, adverse health
consequences or death. The procedures of subsection © are the same as in section S18( e), the parallel
provision for devices.


Section 909, Records and Reports
        The bill incorporates subsections (a) and (t) of section S19, but adopts a different threshold for
requiring reports to be submitted under subsection (a). The bill authorizes the Secretary to require a report
from a manufacturer or importer who becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of its
marketed tobacco products may have caused or contributed to a serious unexpected adverse experience



                                                      30
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

associated with the use of the product or any significant increase in the frequency of a serious, expected,
adverse product experience. The provisions of 519 dealing with user facilities and device tracking have
been omitted because they are not suited to the needs of regulating tobacco products.


Section 910, Premarket Review
        Section 910 provides for premarket review of new tobacco products that are not substantially
equivalent to products on the market as of August 11, 1995. This section provides the Secretary with
authority to obtain needed data on the risks of novel tobacco products, and to assure that such products do
not introduce more risks than conventional tobacco products. The provisions of section 910 are similar to
those of section 515, with the following modifications: (1) full reports must be provided on the health risks
of the product, rather than on safety and effectiveness; (2) the Secretary shall deny approval of the
application if the Secretary finds that there is a lack of a showing that permitting the product to be
marketed would be appropriate for the public health, rather than a lack of a showing of safety and
effectiveness; (3) the. opportunity for administrative review of an approval or denial of an application has
been eliminated; (4) the standard for the evidence needed to support an application has been modified
slightly to clarify that well-controlled investigations will be required only when necessary; and (5) the
provisions related to product development protocols have been eliminated.
        The bill provides that an approval of an application for premarket approval is not required for a
tobacco product subject to section 910(a)(I) introduced into or delivered for introduction into interstate
commerce for commercial distribution (other than for test marketing) in the United States between August
11, 1995, and the date of enactment of this bill if a report has been submitted pursuant to section 905(j)
within six months of the enactment of this bill until the Secretary issues an order that requires premarket
approval.


        Definition ofsubstantial equivalence: Subsection (a)(2) includes provisions, analogous to section
513(1) in the device provisions, that define "substantial equivalence" for purposes of this section and
section 905(j). The definition in 91 O(a)(2) is largely the same as in section 513(1) with a few
modifications. The principal changes are: (1) the standard for a finding by the Secretary that a product
with different characteristics than an already marketed (predicate) product does not require premarket



                                                      31
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

review is whether the infonnation submitted by the manufacturer demonstrates that premarket review

would not be appropriate because the new product does not raise different public health questions than the

predicate product; (2) the tenn "characteristics" means the materials, ingredients, design, composition,

heating source, or other features of a tobacco product; and (3) the summary of infonnation required under

910(a)(3)(A) must cover "any health infonnation related to the tobacco product" rather than safety and

effectiveness infonnation.


Section 911, Judicial review
        The bill includes procedures for judicial review of certain actions under chapter IX that are the

same as section 517. The bill also incorporates the requirement of section 517 that a regulation or order

issued under certain sections of chapter IX must include a statement of the reasons for its issuance and the

basis in whatever proceedings that led to its issuance, for its issuance.



Section 912, Postmarket Surveillance
        The bill grants the Secretary discretion to require a manufacturer to conduct postmarket

surveillance of a tobacco product if the Secretary determines that such surveillance is necessary to protect

the public health or to provide infonnation regarding the health risks and other safety issues involving the

tobacco product.



Section 913, Reduced Risk Tobacco Products
        The bill contains a section not in device law that pennits the Secretary to designate a tobacco

product as a "Reduced Risk Tobacco Product" if the Secretary fmds, based on an application by the

manufacturer or other responsible person that includes data from studies as specified in the bill and as

required by the Secretary, the product will significantly reduce harm to individuals caused by a tobacco

product and is otherwise appropriate to protect the public health based on an application by the

manufacturer or other responsible person. A tobacco product may be marketed as a "Reduced Risk

Tobacco Product" only if the product is so designated by the Secretary, bears a label prescribed by the

Secretary concerning the product's contribution to reducing harm to health, and complies with

requirements prescribed by the Secretary relating to advertising, marketing, and other provisions of chapter



                                                      32
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

IX. The Secretary may revoke such designation at any time after providing an opportunity for an informal

hearing. The bill also provides that a manufacturer of a tobacco product shall provide written notice to the

Secretary upon the development or acquisition of any technology that would reduce the risk of such

products to the health of the user for which the manufacturer is not seeking designation as a "Reduced Risk

Tobacco Product" under this section.



Section 914, Preservation o/State and Local Authority
         The bill includes provisions regarding state and local requirements affecting tobacco products that

relate to matters under chapter IX. Section 914 incorporates portions of section 521, which relates to state

and local requirements respecting devices. Preemption of state and local requirements affecting tobacco

products under section 914 is more limited than under the device section.      State or local requirements that

are different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under chapter IX relating to performance

standards, premarket approval, adulteration, misbranding, registration, reporting, good manufacturing

standards, or reduced risk products, are preempted. As is the case in section 521, state or political

subdivisions may apply for a waiver of preemption from the Secretary.       The procedures in subsection ©

are the same as in section 521. State and local requirements relating to the sale, use, or distribution of a

tobacco product, including requirements related to the access to, and the advertising and promotion of a

tobacco product, that are in addition to, or more stringent than, requirements under chapter IX are not

preempted by the FDCA. .

         The bill makes clear that except as expressly provided in section 914, nothing shall in the FDCA

shall be construed as prohibiting a State or political subdivision from adopting or enforcing a requirement

applicable to a tobacco produd that is in addition to, or more stringent than requirements established under

chapter IX.   The bill provides that where a requirement of a State or political subdivision is more stringent

than a requirement established under chapter IX, the requirement of the State or political subdivision shall

apply.   The bilI also ·clarifies that no provisions of chapter IX relating to tobacco produds shall be

construed to modify or otherwise affed any adion or the liability of any person under the produd liability

laws of any State.



Section 915, Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee



                                                      33
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

        Under the bill, the Secretary will establish a tobacco product scientific advisory committee.
Several device sections that are incorporated into chapter IX include provisions that require the Secretary
to establish an advisory committee for purposes of specific duties under each section. The approach used
in chapter V, had it been adopted in chapter IX for tobacco products, would have required at least three
separate advisory committees. The Committee has instead provided for a single tobacco product
advisory committee to perform the responsibilities specified in sections 906(g), 907, and 910.                   In
addition, the advisory committee will provide advice, information, and recommendations to the
Secretary on the effects of the alteration of the nicotine yield from tobacco products; on whether
there is a threshold level below which nicotine yields do not produce dependence on the tobacco
product involved; and on other safety, dependence, or health issues relating to tobacco products
as requested by the Secretary.


Section 916 Equal Treatment ofRetail Outlets
        The bill provides that the Secretary shall issue regulations to require that retail establishments for
which the predominant business is the sale of tobacco products comply with any advertising restrictions
applicable to retail establishments accessible to individuals under the age of 18.


VI. Section 102, Conforming and Other Amendments to the General Provisions of the FDCA
        Chapter ill of the FDCA, which contains prohibited acts and penalties, provides the mechanisms
and remedies for enforcing the various requirements in the product-specific chapters. Chapter VII includes
general administrative provisions for regulations and hearings, examinations and investigations, records of
intestate commerce, inspections, publicity, the treatment of confidential information, and a presumption of
interstate commerce. Chapter Vill pertains to imports and exports. Chapter X, as redesignated by this
bill, contains miscellaneous sections. The basic approach of the bill is to expressly include "tobacco
product" wherever "device"appeared in these provisions. In a few instances, new provisions based on
provisions applicable to devices were added. The intent is to ensure that the full range of compliance,
enforcement, and other general authorities available to the Secretary for devices continue when tobacco
products are regulated pursuant to chapter IX.




                                                     34
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
Exports

          The amendments to sections 801(e) and 802, which include the addition of a new paragraph (4) to
section 801{e) and a new paragraph (3) to section 802(a), impose the same requirements for the export of
tobacco products that do not meet the requirements of the FDCA that apply to devices.
          Sections SO 1(e)(4) and 802 apply to tobacco products that do not comply with performance
standards promulgated by the Secretary under section 907, do not comply with the premarket review
requirements in section 910, if applicable, or are exempt from sections 907 or 910 pursuant to regulations
promulgated under section 906(f). Tobacco products that comply with these requirements, but violate
other provisions of the FDCA may be exported if they comply with the basic export requirements in
section SO 1(e)(1).
          The new section SOl (e)(4) tracks the requirements of section 801(e)(2), which applies to certain
device exports. Similarly, new paragraph (3) of section S02(a) parallels paragraph (3), which lists the
statutory categories of devices to which section S02 applies.
          Some concerns were raised in the Committee regarding the terms "approval of the country to
which it is intended for export" and "valid marketing authorization" which appear in sections 801(e)(4)
and 802, respectively. These terms apply to device exports in current law. Many foreign countries do not
have affirmative approval systems for medical devices and others do not have medical device laws.         FDA
interprets the term "approval of the country to which it is intended for export" in section SO 1(e)(2) to mean
that the importing country must approve of the importation of the device. This is frequently established
through a letter to FDA from the relevant authority in that country indicating that the country will permit or
does not object to the importation of the device. With respect to the phrase "valid marketing
authorization" in section S02(b), in those countries in which the regulatory systems permit
marketing of a device without an affirmative act or decision by the government, FDA considers
the device to have "marketing authorization" if the country does not object to the product's
marketing. These workable and effective approaches to the language of sections 801(e) and
802(b) are appropriate for tobacco product exports as well.
          Thus, under section S02, a tobacco product that violates a performance standard promulgated
under section 907, such as one prohibiting certain ingredients, could be exported to any country in which it
can be legally marketed if at least one country "listed" in section 802(b)(1 )(A) permits its sale, and the



                                                      35
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

requirements of section 802(f) are met. This approach is consistent with FDA's application of section
802(b) to devices.


                                             Subtitle B: Advertising


Sec. 121. Advertising Provisions in Protocol
           Section 121 indicates the advertising limitations the protocol must contain and that the tobacco
product manufacturers must commit to observe.


Sec. 122. Tobacco Product Labeling and Advertising
           Section 122 identifies the various requirements that would be contained in the protocol. Under
the protocol no tobacco product could be sold or distributed in the United States unless the numerous
advertising and labeling requirements are met. Those limitations are the same as those contained in the
agreement reached on June 20, 1997 with the addition of animal figures and color advertising on the back
of all magazines.


Sec. 123. Point-ol-Sale Restrictions.
           Section 123 would require that the protocol contain various limitations on the use of point-of-sale
advertising.




                         Title 11-- REDUCTIONS IN UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE
Sec. 201. Goals/or reducing underage tobacco use.
           Section 201 requires the Secretary, in cooperation with state, local and tribal authorities, to take all
actions under this act necessary to achieve prescribed reductions in youth usage of cigarettes and spit
tobacco.
           These reductions must be made from a baseline percentage of youth tobacco usage established by
a comprehensive study conducted at the University of Michigan in 1995. This model identified the number
of youth (age 13-17) who use tobacco daily and calculated the percentage of such tobacco users in relation



                                                        36
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
to the total population in that age bracket.
         This section requires that in years 3 and 4 after the date of enactment of this Act, the incidence of
youth cigarette smoking among the underage population (age 13 to 17) be reduced by at least 15 percent of
the baseline percentage; at least a 30 percent reduction from the 1995 baseline percentage in years 5 and 6;
at least a 50 percent reduction from the baseline percentage for years 7, 8, and 9; and for year 10 and
beyond a 60 percent reduction from the baseline percentage is required.
         This section also sets targets for youth consumption reductions for smokeless (spit) tobacco. For
year 3 and 4, a 12.5 percent reduction in youth consumption of smokeless or spit tobacco from the 1995
baseline percentage is required. For years 5 and 6, a 25 percent reduction from the 1995 baseline
percentage is required. For years 7,8, and 9 a 35 percent reduction from the 1995 baseline percentage is
required. For year 10 and thereafter a 45 percent reduction from the 1995 baseline percentage is required.




Sec. 202.   Look Back Assessment
         Section 202 sets forth: how the baseline of youth tobacco use is established, how non-attainment
of youth tobacco targets is determined and, how financial assessments would be imposed on the industry
for falling to meet youth tobacco use reduction targets.
         Section (a) calls on the Secretary to conduct annually a survey using the University of Michigan
survey model or some other more accurate measurement method at the Secretary's discretion. Using the
selected survey model, the Secretary shall calculate the incidence of underage tobacco use and measure
the percentage reduction from the 1995 percentage baseline established in the University of Michigan
study.
         Subsection (b) calls on the Secretary to impose financial penalties for each percentage point that
youth consumptions reductions fall short of the targets established in Section 201.
         The financial penalties for cigarettes are as follows: from one to five percentage points short of the
youth tobacco usage reduction goal, the industry must pay $80 million per point; from six to nine points
short, the industry must pay $160 million per point; from 10 or more points short, the industry must pay
$240 million per point.
         For instance, if in year five the incidence of youth tobacco usage falls by only 25 percent, rather



                                                      37
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

than the required 30 percent, the industry would be assessed a penalty of $400 million ($80 million
multiplied by each percentage point missed, in this case five).    If youth tobacco usage falls by only 23
percent (or 7 points short of target ), the industry would be assessed the $400 million for points 1-5, and an
additional $320 million ($160 million multiplied by two for points six and seven) for a total penalty of
$720 million.
        The financial penalties for smokeless tobacco are $8 million per point for percentage points one
through 5; $16 million per point for percentage points 5 through 10; and, $24 million per point beyond 10
percentage points.
        The Committee believes that the severity of the penalty should increase with the severity of the
non-attainment. Accordingly, for non-attainment of between 5 and 10 percentage points, the penalty is
doubled from $80 million to $160 million per point; and for non-attainment of more than ten points, the
penalty is tripled from $80 million to $240 million per point.
        The financial penalties are assessed and calculated in the same manner for cigarettes and spit
tobacco, although the penalties for smokeless are different from those for cigarettes.
        Subsection (b)(3) establishes an annual cap on penalties of $3.5 billion. Financial penalties
assessed under this Title shall not be tax deductible. The June 20th agreement capped penalties at $2
billion per year and provided that those penalties would be tax deductible.    Furthermore, when the $3.5
billion annual cap under S. 1415 is reached, the industry and individual tobacco manufacturers may also
lose the liability cap provided in Title VII.
        Subsection (b)(4) provides that if the industry fails to attain the youth smoking reduction target in
any year by more than 20 points, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall determine which
manufacturers are responsible for the industry failing to meet the target and shall take action to remove the
liability limitations provided in Title vn from such manufacturer or manufacturers.
        Subsection© provides that each manufacturer shall be jointly and severally liable for the
payment. Under this provision, the Secretary may receive payment from any or all of the manufacturers.
The manufacturers would then have the right to seek compensation from each other for equitable payment
of industry penalties. This provision serves as a major incentive for individual companies to achieve
reduction targets, and to hold non-performing companies individually liable.
        Subsection (c)(4) provides a de-minimis exemption for payment of penalties to any manufacturer



                                                     38
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

with less than one percent of domestic, unless such manufacturers product is used predominantly by

underage users.
        Subsection (t) provides that monetary penalty payments are non-tax deductible as ordinary and

necessary business expenses.


Section 203. Substantial Non-attainment ofRequired Reductions


        This section provides for the procedures by which the Secretary of Health and Human Services
would seek to remove the civil liability apportionment cap of any company that exceeds its non-attainment
of the youth reduction target by greater than 20 points. The court of jurisdiction shall determine whether

the preponderance of evidence shows that the manufacturer failed to comply with this act, or took any
material action to undermine achievement of the youth tobacco use reduction goal.

        The subsection provides that any loss of liability limitation under Title VII of this act shall be in
effect the later of either two years, or until the manufacturer is in compliance with the Act; has ceased

taking material actions to undermine achievement of the reduction target; and has pursued reasonable
additional measures to achieve youth tobacco use targets.



Section 204. Definitions
        Section 204 definitions relevant terms.



                       SUBTITLE B-STATE ENFORCEMENT INCENTIVES
Sec. 211. Compliance Bonus Fund
        Section 211 establishes within the National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund a separate account
called the Compliance Bonus Account for States and Retailers.


Sec. 212. Block Grants.
        The Secretary would award block grants each year to states where "fewer than 5 percent of all

individuals under 18 years of age who attempt to purchase tobacco products in the State" are successful
such purchase.



                                                     39
                                                               Hex·Dump Conversion

Sec. 213. State Enforcement Incentives
           This section sets out requirements for State eligibility for grants authorized under Section 212,
including state enforcement of state law requiring a minimum age of 18 years for the legal purchase of
tobacco products, and the conduct of random testing of retail outlets to enforce compliance with youth

access requirements.      The FDA's youth access requirements require retailers to check the photo ID of
customers under the age of 27 who are seeking to buy cigarettes or smokeless tobacco.         States are
required to send the results of their tobacco compliance checks to the FDA.

           A state is deemed in non-compliance with this section if such state has not complied with the
minimum number of random, unannounced inspections and other minimum guidelines established in this

title. Likewise a state is deemed in non-compliance if the state inspections find that the retail outlets in
such state do not achieve the following compliance targets with the applicable youth access restriction: 75
percent compliance in years 5 and 6 after enactment; at least 85 percent compliance in years 8, 9, and 10;
at least 90 percent compliance in year 11 and every year thereafter.

           The Secretary shall establish a reduction in the Section 1921 amount for non-compliance with this

Section.
                                          Subtitle C: Other Programs


Section 221. National Smoking Cessation Program


           This section authorizes the Secretary to award grants to public and nonprofit entities, and
individuals for smoking cessation purposes. The creation of a national smoking cessation program is called
for under the June 20th agreement.       Funds to these entities shall be used to establish and administer

approved tobacco product use cessation programs. Thefunds or vouchers received by individuals are
intended to help citizens enroll in a program to permanently help them stop using cigarettes or other
tobacco product.      The Secretary will issue regulations for approved tobacco product cessation programs
and products, based on the best scientific information available.

           Approximately 48 million Americans currently smoke cigarettes, and most smokers are either

actively trying to quit or want to quit. While prevention programs can prevent many young people from



                                                       40
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion .

ever becoming addicted to nicotine, some will succumb and ten to twenty million current smokers will die
from tobacco-related diseases unless they have access to treatment for tobacco addiction.
        Although it is difficult to quit tobacco use because of the addictive nature of the product, quitting
results in significant and immediate health benefits both for healthy people as well as for those suffering
from tobacco-related diseases. For those who quit smoking fifteen years ago, for example, the risk of
death today is similar to the risk for people who have never smoked at aiL In addition, the health benefits
of quitting tobacco are significant for the unborn children of pregnant women and for children and adults
exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.
        The Committee finds that tobacco use treatment will reduce the human toll of tobacco and is cost
effective. Compared to the estimated $60 billion in direct medical care spent annually on smoking-related
illnesses and another $47 billion accounted for lost productivity and forfeited earnings caused by
smoking-related disabiliti~s, the average estimated per smoker cost for smoking cessation is $165. The
cost of each intervention varies according to the amount of counseling, whether and which pharmaceutical
adjuncts are offered, and effectiveness of the intervention. For every dollar invested in a smoking
cessation program for pregnant women, an estimated $6 is saved in neonatal intensive care costs and the
long-term care associated with low birth weight.
        However, a number of barriers impede the delivery of effective tobacco use cessation services.
        Clinicians do not consistently assess whether their patients use tobacco, nor do they offer smoking
cessation treatment to every smoker at every office visit. Evidence shows that 70 percent of U.S. smokers
see their physician each year, and 60 percent of the U.S. population five years of age and older is seen by a
dentist, giving physicians and dentists considerable access to smokers. If only half of all the U.S.
physicians and dentists gave brief advice to their patients and 10 percent of them were successful in
quitting, there would be nearly 2 million new nonsmokers in the U.S. each year.
        Inadequate training, lack of time and lack of reimbursement for services have made it difficult for
physicians and other health care professionals to provide adequate tobacco cessation counseling and
treatment.
        Surveys indicate that tobacco cessation therapy is not consistently provided as paid services for
subscribers of health insurance packages despite the fact that tobacco use cessation is considered a highly
cost effective service. One survey demonstrated that as few as 11 percent of health insurance carriers



                                                     41
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

provide coverage for treatment of nicotine addiction; another survey of 105 health maintenance
organizations found that few knew about the prevalence of smoking within their membership. In addition,
a 1994 study of California health insurance plans found that only two percent of the 48 insurance
companies sold any policies that covered smoking cessation treatment. Even Medicare and Medicaid do
not routinely cover smoking cessation services.
         Tobacco users of low socioeconomic status tend to be under served by tobacco use cessation
programs. They may be less likely to have health insurance; they may be unable to afford over-the-counter
cessation products; or they may live in areas where these products are less easily obtainable and cessation
services less accessible.
         When financial barriers are removed, participation increases. For example, when Group Health
Cooperative ofPuget Sound included smoking cessation as a covered benefit, its program participation
jumped ten-fold, from 175 participants to over 2,000 in the first year. In groups with a $42 co-payment,
about 30 percent of registered participants did not participate. By contrast, only one percent of those with
no co-payment do not participate after registering.
         The Committee intends its bill to establish a national comprehensive tobacco use treatment
program which includes: grants to states and localities; support of federal programs providing health
services to low-income Americans, training of health care professionals, and other appropriate initiatives to
fulfill the purposes of this section.
         Finally, the Committee recognizes the tobacco use treatment methods as outlined in the 1996
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) Clinical Practice Guideline on Smoking Cessation,
and recommends that grant recipients who develop and administer such programs mirror these and/or other
similar evidence based guidelines. AHCPR's cessation guidelines recommend that clinicians record the
tobacco-use status of every patient and offer smoking cessation treatment to every smoker at every office
visit. Any national cessation effort must ensure that health care systems are doing everything they can to
identifY and intervene with tobacco users. The Committee expects AHCPR to periodically update its
guidelines as new research becomes available regarding tobacco use treatment methods. Furthermore, the
Committee believes that dissemination of the guidelines to clinicians and other health professionals is
essential.

        Section 222 of the bill reported by the Committee would establish an independent board to enter

into contracts with or award grants to both private and public entities to carry out public informational and

educational activities designed to reduce the use of tobacco. The creation of creation of the National

Tobacco Free Public Education Program is called for under the June 20th agreement. The Committee

intends for this program to be multifaceted, but the primary focus should be on counter-advertising, and

the programs should serve as a complement to the community based education programs outlined above.

        The Committee has directed that the programs in this section be established because it believes

they are necessary to offset the extensive marketing efforts ofthe industry. The tobacco industry spends

over five billion dollars a year marketing and advertising its products. A 1998 study in the Journal of the

American Medical Association provided evidence that tobacco industry advertising and promotional

activities are causally related to the onset of smoking. In addition, a 1995 article in the Journal of the

National Cancer Institute found that tobacco marketing has a greater influence than exposure to parents or

peers who smoke in prompting children to take up smoking, and other studies have shown the vast

majority of young smokers, unlike adults, prefer one of the most heavily advertised brands of cigarettes.

In addition, recently released internal tobacco industry documents indicate a deliberate strategy by the

tobacco industry to attract children. Research also shows that anti-tobacco advertisements are effective in

reducing tobacco consumption.      The 1994 Surgeon General's Report indicates that mass media are

particularly appropriate channels for tobacco education among young people who are heavily exposed to

and often greatly interested in the media. A coordinated national campaign can be quite effective, the

Committee believes, in discouraging the use of tobacco products and inducing smokers to quit using

tobacco products. The Committee intends for this section to provide for a national media campaign but to

also provide for assistance to state and local efforts to discourage smoking and tobacco use. The

Committee believes that while it is critical to have a national effort, local priorities and unique

circumstances such as high rates of smokeless tobacco product use or particularly high rates among

specific population groups must also be addressed.

        At present, there is no national anti-tobacco public education campaign to counter the pro-tobacco

imagery presented to both adults and children by tobacco industry marketing efforts. Several states (e.g.,

California, Arizona, and Massachusetts) have developed programs that have been shown to be effective,



                                                      43
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

and several more have recently received funds for short term programs through settlements of lawsuits
(Mississippi, Florida, Texas), but relatively few states have the resources to undertake the type of

sustained, long term extensive public education and counter-advertising efforts that are necessary. fu part
this is due to the high cost of developing these programs and purchasing media. The federal approach
outlined in this section will address this critical need.
        These programs are to be media- and nonmedia-based. Paid mass media is an essential

component of any effective public education effort. According to various studies, paid media is most
effective when it is utilized in conjunction with other approaches. This section requires a
multidisciplinary effort. Mass media prevention efforts should be coordinated with community and

school-based prevention programs as well as clinical interventions. In addition, the programs must

address in a culturally appropriate way high-risk and special populations, especially because these groups

have often been the target of marketing and advertising efforts directed specifically to them.
        The Committee notes that it is essential that the advertising provided under this section be

undertaken free from any connection to or influence by the tobacco industry, and so directs the Secretary to
ensure that any resources and decision making utilized to carry out this section are unencumbered by any
such connections or influence. The Committee believes that the independent board established in this
section will allow for the creation of the most effective programs and will provide for the necessary
flexibility to ensure that the needs of local communities are met.    In addition, an independent board that

includes experts in advertising, marketing, public health, adolescent psychology and education that are not
in any affiliated with the tobacco industry will ensure that the programs provided for under this section are
effective.



Section 223. National Community Action Program


         Section 223 of the bill reported by the Committee authorizes the establishment of a grant program

to assist local communities in their efforts to educate the community and young people about the dangers
of tobacco and·ways to reduce tobacco use and to assist in encouraging the reduction of tobacco use. The

creation of a National Community Action Program is called for under the June 20 agreement. The
Committee regards community based prevention and education programs including school based programs



                                                       44
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

to be critical aspects of a national tobacco control strategy and essential to discouraging tobacco use and
reversing the upward trends in youth tobacco use.
         Research demonstrates that well-designed, well-implemented school-based programs to prevent
tobacco are effective and provide education during the years when the risk of becoming addicted to
tobacco is greatest. The 1994 Surgeon General's Report, Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People,
indicates that school-based smoking prevention programs that identify social influences to smoke and teach
skills to resist those influences have demonstrated consistent and significant reductions in adolescent
smoking. In addition to the demonstrated reductions in tobacco use, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) has indicated that these school-based programs can also help prevent the use of other

drugs.
         Research, including the 1994 Surgeon General's Report, indicates that community-based strategies
to prevent tobacco use are important adjuncts to school-based programs. The effectiveness of
school-based tobacco prevention programs appears to be enhanced and sustained by community wide
programs that involve parents, mass media, community organizations, and other elements of an
adolescent's social environment. This report indicates that concerted use of multiple school and
community channels for affecting adolescent tobacco-use behavior can produce a synergistic effect on the
risk factors associated with adolescent tobacco use.
         In the last 15 years, several major community-based prevention trials that target youth tobacco use

have been undertaken and have proven to be effective in driving down youth smoking rates. For example,
the Minnesota Heart Health Program, addressed several cardiovascular risk factors for all age groups and
used a variety of community strategies. Young people in this study received interventions through school
and home-based programs indirectly through a community wide attempt to structure the overall social and
physical environment to discourage young people from beginning to use tobacco. Young people in this
study, had significantly lower smoking prevalence.
         Several states are undertaking anti-tobacco campaigns. Minnesota was the first to use tobacco
excise taxes to carry out such a program. More recently, California, Massachusetts, and Arizona have
adopted state-based public education programs, and several other states are initiating them. While it is too
early to evaluate the efforts of many of the programs, the available data demonstrate that both the
California and Massachusetts programs both of which include large scale community-based components



                                                       45
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

have been effective in reducing tobacco use. For example, three years after Massachusetts began its

public education and tobacco control campaign, an independent evaluation found that tobacco

consumption in Massachusetts declined at a rate three times that of the rate for the rest of the nation, and

while smoking among high school students increased dramatically on the national level, it did not increase

significantly in Massachusetts.
        The American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention (ASSIST), which is funded

through the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health, has provided further evidence

regarding the effectiveness of comprehensive coordinated community efforts to reduce tobacco use.

ASSIST provides funding to 17 states and is designed to promote broad social and environmental change.

After just 4 years, tobacco consumption in ASSIST states was 10 percent lower than in non-ASSIST states

-- an estimated 70 million fewer packs of cigarettes being consumed each month in these states. ASSIST

has been used as a model for the development of state-based tobacco control interventions in California,

Massachusetts, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's limited tobacco control

program. The Committee intends that a significant portion of the funds from this section be used to fund

the expansion of the ASSIST program or programs modeled after ASSIST.

        Research in the United States and abroad has demonstrated that education and prevention

programs work to both increase knowledge and decrease consumption. But, there have been insufficient

resources and commitment, including from the federal government, and the Committee intends its bill to

greatly increase the resources available to assist state and local community efforts to discourage tobacco

use.


Section 224. State Retail Licensing Program


        This section provides for the establishment of a state retail licensing incentive grant program to be

administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. To receive a grant, a state must enter into

an agreement with the Secretary to assume responsibility for implementation and enforcement of a tobacco

retailer licensing program. An effective licensing program which enlists tobacco product retailers and

their employees in a systematic effort to reduce illegal tobacco purchases by minors is vital to this

legislation. The Committee intends that States be allowed the opportunity to design their own retailer



                                                     46
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

licensing programs, in compliance with the basic licensing requirements set forth in this Section. If States
demonstrate to the Secretary ofHHS that their retailer licensing program meets these requirements, and
abides by the Youth Access Restrictions promulgated by the FDA, the State shall receive a block grant out
of settlement funds to pay for the licensing program's administration and enforcement. The Secretary will
promulgate regulations for a retailer licensing system to apply in those States that do not seek to design and
implement their own retailer licensing system.
        Section 235(c) requires States seeking to design and implement their own licensing system (and
receive settlement payments to do so) to demonstrate to the Secretary that their program includes the
following core components. First, a State license is required for all retailers selling tobacco products to
consumers, and the State provides notice to such businesses of their legal requirements pertaining to
tobacco sales under State and Federal law. Second, criminal penalties will be imposed for the sale of
tobacco products without a license, and civil penalties will be imposed for tobacco sales in violation State
law by a licensee. The civil penalties enacted by States must include a graduated system of fines and
suspension or revocation of licenses, for repeated violations by licensees.     The monetary amount of fines
are left to the discretion of States. Third, each State licensing plan must include some form of penalty
imposed upon underage youths who possess, purchase, or attempt to purchase tobacco products. The
penalties could include fines, suspension of driving privileges, or community se~ice. Each State
licensing program must provide procedures for judicial review of all State actions regarding license
applications, suspensions, and revocations.


        Section 235 (b) is the enforcement requirement for States establishing a licensing system with a
settlement block grant. It requires States to enforce its tobacco licensing program in a manner reasonably
expected to reduce the sale of tobacco products to underage youths. To ensure proper State action
regarding enforcement, the Secretary can reduce the block grant of any State found to be not in compliance
with this standard.


        Section 235(c) authorizes the Secretary to establish a retailer licensing system in those States
which did not establish their own. It authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations creating retailer
licensing requirements, enforcement measures and applicable penalties. As under current law, the



                                                     47
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

Secretary is authorized to enter into agreements with State officials for enforcement of federal regulations,
and provide grant funding from tobacco settlement accounts for related costs.




           Title III: Tobacco Product Warnings and Smoke Constituent Disclosure


                     Subtitle A: Product Warnings, Labeling and Packaging


Section 301. Cigarette Label and Advertising Warnings


        Section 301 provides for new, more emphatic warnings for cigarette labels, packaging
and advertising. These new warnings are achieved by amending Section 4 of the Federal
Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (15 U.S.c. 1333).
        In general, this section would require the warning statement to take-up the upper 25
percent of both the front and the back of the cigarette package. Cigarette advertising is also
required to carry these warning statements in compliance with a defined fonnat. The Secretary
of Health and Human Services has the authority to modifY the format for the warning statements
as they appear on cigarette packaging and in cigarette advertising.


Section 302. Authority to Revise Cigarette Warning Label Statements


        The Secretary may by rulemaking modifY the warning label statements if it would
"promote greater public understanding of the risks associated with the use of tobacco products."


Section 303. Smokeless Tobacco Labels and Advertising Warnings


        Section 303 provides for new, more emphatic warnings for smokeless tobacco labels,
packaging and advertising. These new warnings are achieved by amending· Section 3 of the
Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 4402).


                                                     48
                                                     Hex.Dump Conversion

As with cigarettes, the warning statements required must appear in a defined format.


Section 304. Authority to Revise Smokeless Tobacco Product Warning Label Statements


        The Secretary may by rulemaking modify the warning label statements if it would "promote
greater public understanding of the risks associated with the use of smokeless tobacco products."


Section 305. Tar, Nicotine and Other Smoke Constituent Disclosure to the Public


        Section 305 transfers authority over the disclosure of cigarette constituents from the Federal Trade
Commission to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary would be given the authority
to determine whether cigarette package labels and advertising will report tar and nicotine yields. The
Secretary would have the authority to specify the format for such disclosures. The Secretary, by
rulemaking, could also require the disclosure of any other smoke constituent.


              Subtitle B: Testing and Reporting of Tobacco Product Smoke Constituents


Section 311. Regulation Requirement
        Section 311 would require the Secretary to issue regulations, within one year of the Act's
effectiveness, which would provide for the testing, reporting and disclosure to the public of "tobacco
product smoke constituents and ingredients that the Secretary determine should be disclosed ... to protect
the public health."


                           Title IV: National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund
Sec. 401.··Nationai Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund


        This Section establishes a National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund within the United States
Treasury.   The up-front and annual payments received from tobacco manufacturers under Section 403;
amounts equivalent to the fines or penalties paid by tobacco manufacturers for failure to meet youth



                                                    49

tobacco use reduction targets under Section 202,         including interest and penalties under shall be credited

to the trust fund.
         The Section provides that the receipts and disbursement of the Trust Fund shall not be included in
tpe totals of the budget or subject to limitations imposed by other statutes.


Sec. 402.     State Litigation Settlement Account.


         This section provides for the establishment, within the National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund, of
a separate account to be known as the State Litigation Settlement Account.          From the amounts received
into the Trust Fund pursuant to this act, $196 billion shall be credited to the State Litigation Settlement

Account over 25 years.        Amounts credited to the account shall be distributed to eligible states without

further appropriation.
         Subsection 402( c)     provides that as state may use amounts received from the State Litigation
Settlement Account as the state determines is appropriate, and that these funds will not be deemed as
reimbursement for Medicaid expenditures or as Medicaid overpayments for purposes of recoupment.


Section 403. Payments by Industry
         This section requires five of the major participating manufacturers (those manufacturers that
become a signatory of the Master Settlement Agreement and enter into state consent decrees) to make an

up-front payment of $10 billion.


         The up-front payment shall be paid in accordance with the following apportionment:
         Phillip Morris Incorporated -- 65.8 percent
         Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation -- 17.3 percent
         Lorillard Tobacco Company -- 7.1 percent
         RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company -- 6.6 percent
         United States Tobacco Company -- 3.2 percent
            The five major participating manufacturers listed above, and other qualified participating
manufacturers, shall contribute to     annual payments beginning the first year after enactment of this act, as



                                                         so
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
follows.

           Year 1: $14.4 billion
           Year 2: $15.4 billion
           Year 3: $17.7 billion
           Year 4: $21.4 billion
           Year 5: $23.6 billion
           Year 6 and every year thereafter: $23.6 billion.
           The payments pursuant to this section,     made by participating manufacturers, shall be deemed
payments in settlement of civil suits in accordance with the Master Settlement Agreement and consent

decrees.
           The annual amount       required to be paid by participating tobacco manufacturers in years one
through five after enactment of this ad, except for the up-front payment, is calculated by multiplying the
price-per-pack increase designated for that year, by the year's anticipated volume of per-pack sales.        The
price-per- pack increase schedule begins with a 65 cents hike      in year one and graduates to $UO in year
five, in compliance with the Administration's FY '99 budget request.       Anticipated volumes have been
calculated by the U.S. Department of Treasury fadoring in reductions in demand due to yearly price
increases. Accordingly the listed payments are pre-volume adjusted, and have also been adjusted for
inflation.
           The Committee received expert testimony that a substantial and immediate price
                                                                                              .         .

tobacco produds is an essential component of a comprehensive effort to deter youth consumption.             This
sedion will achieve that objedive.

 **Department of Treasury


         In year six and every year thereafter, the participating tobacco manufacturers will be
required to pay $23.6 billion, adjusted to inflation.         The yearly payment beginning in year six is
further volume adjusted.       The payment of $23.6 billion each year will be increased or
decreased by the same percentage increase or decrease in volume of sales from the established
baseline.
         According to the Department of the Treasury, the total sum of payments from tobacco
manufacturers over 25 years, including the $10 billion up-front payment, and assuming no
increase in sales volumes, would not be greater than $516 billion (not including look back
. assessments provided in Title III).
         Annual payments are due in one-third installments to be paid on March 1; June 1: and
September 1 of each year.      The share of the annual payment apportioned to a participating
manufacturer shall be equal to that manufacturer's adjusted unit sales.             This section provides
how adjusted units are calculated for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.
 Sec. 404 Adjustments


         This section provides for the inflation and volume adjustments described above.

Sec. 405 Payments to be passed through to consumers
          This section provides that the yearly payments from participating tobacco manufacturers
required under Section 403, be passed through to the price of tobacco products sold by such
manufacturer.     This is to ensure that the act effects the increases in price necessary to deter youth
consumption.
          This section also provides for the assessment of a penalty against a participating
manufacturer for the failure to pass through payments to product prices.          The penalty is
increased if such shortfall was intentional.


Sec. 406. Tax treatment ofpayments
          This section provides that payments made under section 403 are considered ordinary and
necessary business expenses for purposes of tax treatment in accordance with current law.             The
administration has expressed its concurrence that current law be applied with respect to the tax
treatment of annual payments.


Sec. 407 Enforcement lor nonpayment
          This section provides for the imposition of a civil penalty on a participating manufacturer
for the     failure to make any payment required under Section 404 and 405.           The section
specifies a penalty of    $100,000 for each day, after 60 days, a payment is due.         The section
provides relief from the penalty for any failure to pay that is not willful or intentional.    If a
participating manufacturer fails to    make a payment within one year of when such payment is
due, such manufacturer will be deemed a non-participating manufacturer and will be ineligible
for any protections or assistance provided for under this Act.
Sec. 408 Implementing and Enforcement Funds
          This section provides that not less than $300 million of the amounts available in the trust
fund shall be available each year to the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration to
reimburse the FDA for the cost of implementing and enforcing requirements related to tobacco
products.

        This section authorizes the Trustees to use funds from the Trust Fund to expand funding
for the Child Care Development Block Grant to improve the affordability; quality, and availability
of child care, including health services and improving services for children with disabilities.
Proponents of the amendment by Senator Kerry, as adopted by the Committee, believe that good
quality child care is key to the healthy development of children and constructive after-school
activities are an important part of keeping school-age children from smoking.            Proponents of the
amendment believe that using tobacco settlement funds to expand the Child Care Development
Block Grant, the major federal child care program for working families, by up to $4 billion a
year would help accomplish these goals.' This section provides that any funds made available by
the trustees for the purposes of this section be further subject to appropriations.


                Title V: Standards to Reduce Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke


        Title V provides regulations for a Smoke Free Environment Policy inpub/ic buildings in the U.S.
Health and scientific studies show a causal relationship between secondhand tobacco smoke and disease in
non-smokers. The presence of tobacco smoke in non-ventilated public buildings and corridors is an
unhealthy and unfair imposition on the rights of non smokers.     A smoke free atmosphere in public
buildings will protect the health of all non-smokers from the ill-effects of tobacco smoke. This is of
particular importance to adults and children who have medical ailments which are exacerbated by the
presence of tobacco smoke. Importantly, Title V affords State officials the choice to determine whether
the federal smoke free environment policies mandated herein are suitable for their States. The Committee
recognizes that States have traditional authority over regulations pertaining to tobacco usage in public
facilities, and the varying policy choices which will arise from new health-oriented requirements.
Therefore, section 507 provides States to opt-out of these federal requirements by the enactment of
contrasting State law.
        Section 501 defines the type of buildings to which the federal policy for smoke free buildings will



                                                     54
                                                               Hex·Dump Conversion

apply. The bill defines public buildings as those which are regularly entered by at least ten persons one
day a week, including federally-owned or leased buildings, other than buildings used for residential
purposes.    Section 501(B) lists the buildings which are not considered to be public buildings for the
purposes of this Title, and thus are not subject to the smoke free policy requirements. These are largely
buildings patronized by adults, such as bars, casinos, hotels, private clubs, and restaurants. Importantly,
fast food restaurants are specifically required under section 501 (B) and (C) to establish a smoke free
policy in compliance with this bill. The Committee believes that the large numbers and frequency of
children and teenagers who patronize fast food restaurants warrants the adoption of smoke free
environment policies.
        Section 502 provides the basic elements of the smoke free environment policy that the owners or
controlling lessees public buildings must implement. The owner or lessee who operates the building must
prohibit the smoking of tobacco products within the facility and in close proximity to the facility's
entrance. They may establish a specially-designated smoking area in the building, under the following.
restrictions. The designated smoking areas must directly ventilated to the outside of the building and not
allow tobacco smoke to enter other areas of the public building; the room must be maintained at negative
pressure; and non-smoking individuals do not have to enter the room for any purpose. This section and
Section 505 authorizes the OSHA Administrator to promulgate regulations to carry out this Title.
        Enforcement of a smoke free environment policy is a key aspect of ensuring that non-smokers are
not subject to an unhealthy environment due to violations of this Title. Section 503 authorizes any
aggrieved person, OSHA, and any State or local governmental agency to bring suit in a proper federal
district court to enforce these smoke free environment requirements. Defendants are subject to injunctions
against violative practices and civil penalties fines of up to $5,000 per day of violation. However, to
afford owners and lessors a fair opportunity to correct violations without unnecessary litigation, an
aggrieved person must first provide notice to them about the violation.      Section 503(c) stipulates that the
owner or lessee that operates the building than has 60 days to correct the violation before the grievant can
file an action under this Title.
        Section 506 and section 507 establish the effective date of this title and the ability of States to
opt-out of its requirements, respectively. The Committee believes that this title should not take effect in a
State until that State has the opportunity to evaluate whether they are suitable public building



                                                      55
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


requirements. Therefore this title's federal smoke free environment policies will take effect on the first
day of the January, following the regular session of a State legislature in which a measure to opt out may
have been considered.
         Nothing in this title requires any public facility owner or lessee to make any structural change to
such facility.   If a public facility owner or lessee does not have a specially designated smoking area that
meets the requirements of this title, and does not wish to incur any expense to create such an area, the
owner or lessee may choose not to have a specially designated smoking area.


                                   Title VI: Application to Indian Tribes


Section 601. Short Title


         Section 601 provides that this title may be cited as the "Reduction in Tobacco Use and Regulation
of Tobacco Products in Indian Country Act of 1998.


Section 602. Findings and Purposes


         Section 602 contains findings and purposes relevant to this Title.


Section 603. Application o/Tobacco-Related Provisions to Native Americans


         In making the provisions of the bill applicable to Indian tribes and the manufacture, distribution,
and sale of tobacco or tobacco products (tobacco-related activities) on Indian lands, the Committee had
. various principal objectives, including: first, to ensure national, uniform application of the Act with respect
to the activities of Indian tribes, their members, and tobacco-related activities on Indian lands; second, to
recognize and preserve specified traditional, religious, and ceremonial uses of tobacco as part of the Native
American culture; and third, to recognize the inherent tribal authority to make and enforce laws governing
persons and activities occurring on lands within the tribes' jurisdiction.    The Committee does not intend
to modify current law with regard to jurisdiction on Indian lands.



                                                       56
                                                            Hex-Dump ConversIon

        Sections 601 through 603 of Title VI as reported by this Committee do not represent a final
agreement by the Chairman and Committee members regarding a number of outstanding issues.              It is the

intent of the Committee to reach consensus on language to be included in a Manager's Amendment to be
offered when the bill is considered by the full Senate.    The Committee's intent, however, is clear with
regard to a number of matters: to ensure national, uniform application of the Act with respect to the
activities of Indian tribes, their members, and tobacco-related activities on Indian lands; to recognize and
preserve specified traditional, religious, and ceremonial uses of tobacco as part of the Native American
culture; to disburse tobacco trust fund monies to tribes or tribal organizations on an equitable basis; and to
provide eligible Indian tribes resources to operate tobacco retailer licensing programs, as prescribed for
states under section 224 of the Act. If tribes are unwilling, unqualified or ineligible (or are
non-participating tobacco products manufacturers under the Act) to conduct such licensing programs, then
states may conduct the licensing programs under voluntary cooperative agreements with those tribes, or the
federal government shall conduct such licensing programs.


        The Committee recognizes that language may have to be included to address the unique
circumstances of Alaska, in particular, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, the U.S. Supreme Court's
Venetie decision, and health-care delivery systems traditionally serving Alaska Native communities.


Sec. 604 State tobacco excise tax compliance


        Uniformly increasing the price of tobacco products and eliminating pricing disparities are basic
functions of this Act, and Section 604 is designed to eliminate sources, for non-tribal members, of cheaper
tobacco products. For the sale of tobacco products to non-tribal members, Section 604 requires Indian
tribes to collect and remit to the U.S. Treasury all excise and sales taxes of the state within which the sale
occurs. The Treasury, in tum, is required ·to remit these taxes to the state within which they were
collected.


                    Title VII: Civil Liability of Manufacturers of Tobacco Products

                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

SEC. 701. Definitions


        Section 701 provides definitions for tenus which are not defiried elsewhere in the bill or
which have unique meaning in Title VII.


SEC. 702. Application


        Section 702 explains that the provisions of Title VII apply to all tobacco claims brought
against participating manufacturers and various agents of the participating manufacturers,
including retailers, wholesalers and growers. Section 702(b) clarifies that Title VII does not apply
to non-participating manufacturers, nor does it apply to claims which are not tobacco claims, such
as enforcement actions by the states, workers' compensation claims, securities actions, and actions
brought by the United States. Section 702 also provides a one-time opt out mechanism for states
to elect not to settle their pending actions. The Secretary of the Treasury would establish
procedures for the execution of this opt-out. If a state opts-out, then its actions against the
tobacco manufacturers would not be settled. The state would forgo payments from the National
Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund, but would receive any funds it receives in settlement or
judgement from its suits against tobacco manufacturers.


SEC. 703. Preemption and Relationship to Other Law


        The Section preempts other bases in state law for tobacco claims to the extent that state
law is inconsistent with Title VII. It also   c~arifies   that Title VII does not limit any criminal
liability of the tobacco manufacturers.


SEC. 704. Governmental Claims and Castano Civil Actions
        This section prohibits any state governmental entity, or political subdivision, and Indian
tribes from bringing a tobacco claim, except as provided in Title VII. Section 702(b) provides for



                                                    58
                                                       .      Hex-Dump Conversion

the settlement of existing state claims by consent decree. Section 702(c) settles the pending
private class actions based solely on addiction and dependence and known as the Castano cases.
While the Castano class actions are decertified, the plaintiffs within the class could bring their

actions on an individual basis in accordance with Title VII.   Subsections (2) and (3) of704(c)
provides a mechanism for awarding attorneys' fees in the Castano cases.


SEC. 705. Concurrent Jurisdiction; Federal Cause ofAction; Actions Damages; Liability;

Removal


        Section 705 establishes a federal cause of action for tobacco claims, based upon the
substantive law of the state in which an action is brought. This federal cause of action is the

exclusive cause of action for tobacco claims, and all other bases for claims are preempted. This
approach of creating a federal cause of action allows this Act to cover all tobacco claims, while

both permitting existing state law to apply to those actions and avoiding bringing all tobacco
claims into the Federal court system.
        Section 705(b) provides that tobacco claims may only be brought against a tobacco
manufacturer or the surviving entity of a tobacco manufacturer. This structure provides an
incentive for tobacco manufacturers to elect to participate. Section (b )(2) preserves all causes of

action which would have otherwise been viable under state law if the tobacco manufacturers are
unable to make payments required by the Act. Subsection (c) prohibits addiction and

dependence claims.
        Subsection (d) provides evidentiary rules for tobacco claims: including authentication of
documents produced from the national depository established by the Act, and a prohibition

against introducing evidence related to reduced-risk tobacco products to thereby elminate a
significant disincentive to the development of safer tobacco products.

        Section 705(e) establishes joint and several liability among the participating
manufacturers, but provides that the participating manufacturers will not be jointly and severally
liable with non-participating manufacturers. Participating manufacturers may be jointly and

severally liable with any other person, except a non-participating manufacturer. Subsection (4) of



                                                     59
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

(e) provides that trials in actions against a participating manufacturer and a non-participating
manufacturer may be severed and heard by separate juries. Subsection (5) establishes an
evidentiary rebuttable presumption that nicotine is addictive and that certain diseases are causes·in
whole or in part by use of tobacco products.


SEC. 706. Payment of Tobacco Claim Settlements and Judgments


        This section established a system for payment of settlements and judgments of tobacco
claims out of the fund set aside for these payments. This section coordinates the payment of
judgments and settlements from all courts to ensure that the fund is distributed according to certain
procedures and guidelines. Subsection (b) provides that the Secretary of the Treasury will
maintain a record or judgments and settlements and will establish a priority for their payment.
Payment is made according to the date when the judgment or settlement is registered with the
Secretary. The annual payment cap is established at $6.5 billion. If that amount is insufficient to
pay all the recorded judgments and settlements in any year, then the unpaid judgments and
settlements will be paid in the following year. Subsection (d) permits a participating tobacco
manufacturer to seek an irijunction against any state court which attempts to enforce or execute
any judgment in a manner inconsistent with this section. Section 706(e) provides that the
participating tobacco manufacturers are jointly and severally liable for judgments and settlements
payable under this section and shall enter into an agreement apportioning the amounts payable
among themselves. The apportioned payments are to be given priority, and may not be avoided or
discharged, in any bankruptcy proceeding or other insolvency proceeding.


SEC. 707. Attorneys 'fees and Expenses


        This section establishes an arbitration procedure for awarding plaintiff's attorney's fees
in which the attorney is unable to agree with his client as to the fee to be paid. The arbitration
panel shall consist of 3 people: I selected by the plaintiff, one selected by the attorney, and one
chosen jointly by those 2 arbitrators. Subsection (4) sets forth the substantive criteria the panel



                                                     60
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

must follow in making awards of fees, including the time and labor expended; the novelty and
difficulty of the issues in the claim; the skill required; the extent to which the employment has
precluded other employment; whether a fee agreement exists based upon a fixed fee or a
percentage; time limitations imposed; the amount of the judgment or settlement; the experience
and reputation of the attorney; the undesirability of the action; amounts already paid under the fee
agreement in dispute; and such other factors as justice requires. Nothing in this section abrogates
or restricts the rights of any parties to mediate, negotiate, or settle fee disputes, or to enter into fee
agreements with respect to the allocation or division of fees.


SEC. 708. Non-participating Manufacturers



        This section provides for fees to be paid by non-participating manufacturers, including
fees equivalent to 150 percent of the annual payments made by participating manufacturers and an
escrowed fee to cover potential tobacco claim related liability payments. This structure both
provides an incentive for tobacco manufacturers to participate and ensures there will not be a price
advantage for tobacco manufacturers that do not participate.


SEC. 709. Conforming Amendments



        This section contains provisions necessary to provide consistency with other stat].!tes.


Sec. 71 O. Trust Fund



        This section establishes a Tort Trust Fund, as requested by the Administration, to ensure
that individual claimants have a source for payment of judgments and settlements against the
tobacco companies. This section is a place holder and will be revised.


Title VIII: Tobacco Industry Compliance and Employee Protection From Reprisals

Section 801.   Tobacco Industry Compliance Accountability Requirements


        Section 801 would require the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration to
establish an advisory panel called the "Tobacco Agreement Accountability Pane!."      Within one
year of the effectiveness of the Act, each participating tobacco manufacturer must submit to the
Commissioner a plan to reduce youth smoking. That plan will be reviewed by the Accountability
Panel which may recommend additional measures to reduce youth smoking.
        Annually, the Accountability Panel would be required to submit to the Commissioner and
Congress a report which describes each tobacco manufacturer's compliance with the Act and
determines whether the efforts undertaken by each tobacco manufacturer is likely to meet the
youth smoking reduction targets. The Commissioner is, within 60 days of receiving this report,
required to implement any recommendation made by the Accountability Panel or report to
Congress why the recommendation is not being implemented.
        The panel would be permitted to declare a public health emergency if it unanimously
determines that a tobacco manufacturer's "actions or inactions" concerning compliance with the
Act would create a "clear and present danger to the attainment of the targets for underage smoking
reduction." If the Commissioner determines that the Accountability Panel's determination is
"supported by clear and convincing evidence" then the Commissioner would be required to bring
an action, under provisions of the Act, to seek the "immediate suspension of the manufacturer's
annual limitation cap on civil judgements." If the court then determines that "the Secretary has
proved by clear and convincing evidence" that the tobacco manufacturer's actions or inactions
present a "clear and present danger to the attainment of the targets for underage smoking
reduction", the court may suspend the tobacco manufacturer's annual limitation on civil
judgements.
        If the Secretary determines that the tobacco manufacturer will miss its youth reduction

targets by more than 20 percentage points, the Secretary would be required to either bring an
action against the tobacco manufacturer under section 203 or issue a fmding that the manufacturer
made "reasonable efforts" to reach the attainment targets. Compliance with all Accountability




                                                    62
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

Panel recommendations will be prima facie evidence that the tobacco manufacturer made
"reasonable efforts" to achieve the targets for reduction of youth smoking.
Section 802.   Tobacco Product Manufacturer Employee Protection


        The Act would provide various whistle blower protections for employees of tobacco
manufacturers. The Act would also give the Secretary certain investigatory and enforcement
powers to protect such employees. The Act would provide for judicial review of such
determinations.
        Tobacco manufacturers would be prohibited from taking action against an employee that
exposed the manufacturers's violations of the Act, testified in government proceedings concerning
those violations or refused to engage in practices made unlawful by the act.
        Employees that believe they have been adversely treated for their actions to expose
tobacco manufacturer violations may file a complaint with the Secretary. The Secretary would be
required to investigate the employee's complaint and may take action to reinstate a fired employee
or take other actions to abate the violation if the employee makes aprimafacie showing of
discriminatory treatment due to the employee's actions to expose the tobacco company's
violations. The Secretary may dismiss the employee's complaint if the tobacco manufacturer
proves by clear and convincing evidence that it did not discriminate or retaliate against the
employee.


                     Title IX: Public Disclosure of Tobacco Industry Documents


        Over the past several decades, tobacco companies have amassed a truly massive amount of
scientific, manufacturing, marketing, and company policy information.        These documents, which
include internal tobacco company studies and strategic policy assessments, comprise literally
millions of pages.    They are of tremendous importance to public health officials interested in an
effective national tobacco policy, as well as private citizens.   The information that can be gleaned
from these materials will be especially vital to individuals who have suffered medical problems due
to tobacco products, and who are considering whether to file suit for compensation.       Without a

centralized tobacco document repository, citizen plaintiffs would face considerable costs, delays, and
difficulties in investigating company information that may be relevant to the consideration of their
claim.     Discovery efforts could prove extremely burdensome and time consuming for many
individuals. The Committee supports the State Attorneys General recommendation that a central
document repository of appropriate, non-privileged tobacco company information be established.
The repository will serve the Act's objective of a sound national tobacco policy by providing public
access to documentary evidence of the industry's knowledge, policies, and conduct.


Section 901.      Findings


           Section 901 contains Congressional findings that the tobacco manufacturers have taken
action in bad faith to protect internal documents from public disclosure when disclosure of those
documents would promote public understanding of the tobacco industry's research and business
practices.


Section 902.      Applicability


           This Title applies only to participating manufacturers of tobacco products as defined under
the Act.


Section 903.      National Tobacco Document Depository


           Section 903 would require the participating tobacco product manufacturers to establish in
the Washington DC area, within 180 days of the enactment ofthis Act, a document repository
called the National Tobacco Document Depository. This document depository would greatly
enhance the knowledge of both the public and the public health community concerning tobacco
industry behavior and research concerning tobacco products. The document depository would
also greatly facilitate individuals in bringing lawsuits against the tobacco manufacturers to gain
compensation for injuries related to tobacco use.



                                                      64
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
        Each participating tobacco product manufacturer would be required to place in the
Depository all of its documents, and those of the Center of Tobacco Research or the Tobacco
Institute, concerning: 'all original laboratory research; all industry documents produced in
discovery in the actions brought by state attorneys general; any documents produced in
conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission's investigation concerning Joe Camel; all
documents produced to litigation adversaries during any private litigation and in specifically
enumerated litigation; any trial-related documents; any documents referring to health research
about tobacco products, dependency of consumers on tobacco products, and safer or less
hazardous tobacco products; all indices of documents relating to tobacco products and health; and,
various privilege and trade secrecy logs describing certain documents exempt from disclosure.
        Section 903(d) would provide for the disclosure, by participating tobacco manufacturers,
of documents created after the effective date of the Act. The following types of documents would
have to be supplied to the depository within 90 days of the document's completion: all original
laboratory research relating to the health effects or safety of tobacco products; all studies relating
to tobacco product use by minors; all documents referring to the relationship between advertising
and promotion of tobacco products and their use by minors; a privilege log to describe those
documents that are exempt from disclosure; and, a trade secrecy log to describe such documents
that are exempt from disclosure.
        All documents supplied to the Depository would be sequentially numbered and coded to
identify the tobacco manufacturer that is the source of the document.


Section 904. Privilege and Trade Secret Claims


        Section 904 establishes procedures for handling documents the tobacco manufacturers
claim should not be made available to the public due to attorney-client privilege, attorney work
product protection or trade secret protection. The tobacco manufacturers would be required to
submit such documents to the Depository but they would be marked as privileged documents.
Submitting such documents to the Depository would not waive any claim of privilege or trade
secret protection.



                                                      65
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion


        The tobacco manufacturers would be required to provide a comprehensive log that
identifies all documents for which a privilege is asserted. The log of documents would describe
each document and explain why a privilege is asserted. Tobacco manufacturers would be
required to examine each document for which they had previously made a claim of privilege and
make a good faith review as to whether that claim is still appropriate.


Section 905. Disclosure by the Depository


        The Depository would be required to release to the public all documents that are not
privileged by placing them on the Internet and through other appropriate methods.
        Under Section 905(b), documents that are submitted to the Depository are to be treated for
evidentiary purposes in the same manner as documents from the National Archives. In other
words, if the document is certified as coming from the Depository, then it is authenticated as a
matter of evidence and is treated as if it were the original document.
        Under Section 905( c), if a document, protected as a trade secret, is released
inappropriately by the Board or the Depository it is a criminal violation.


Section 906. National Tobacco Documents Review Board


        Section 906 creates the National Tobacco Documents Review Board with 5 members,
appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.      The Board would have responsibility
for maintaining and operating the Depository. The Board would be charged with applying the
doctrines of attorney-client privilege and attorney work-product in a manner consistent with
Federal law.


Section 907. Resolution ofDisputed Privilege and Trade Secret Claims


        The Board would be responsible for determining whether to uphold or reject a tobacco
manufacturer's claim that a document should not be revealed to the public due to a claim that the



                                                     66

document is protected by attorney client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine or trade
secret protection. Such a determination could be made by a single member of the Board. The
decision is to be made in writing and is subject to judicial review.


Section 908. Appeal ofBoard Decision



        Any person may appeal a decision by the Board by filing a petition for review with the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In the Appeals Court's review, the
Board's findings of fact are conclusive if supported by "substantial evidence on the record taken as
a whole". The Appeals Court would be able to conduct a de novo review of the Board's legal
decisions. The Supreme Court may review any decision made by the Appeals Court.


        Once a final decision has been reached about the document, the Board would be required
to make it available to the public within 30 days. Once a final decision has been reached no
Federal or State court would have jurisdiction to again evaluate a claim of privilege as to that
document.
        If the Board decides that a document should not be made available to the public due to an
appropriate claim of privilege, the Board's decision is not binding in a judicial proceeding
concerning that document.
        Section 907(t) would require participating tobacco manufacturers to supply to the Food
and Drug Administration any document it submits to the Depository for public review and all
documents for which it asserts a trade secret protection. Tobacco manufacturers would not have
to supply documents for which it asserts attorney-client privilege or attorney work product
protection.


Section 909.   Miscellaneous



        Section 909(a) appears to be a duplicate power of Section 90S(/).




                                                     67
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

         The disclosure process in this Title does not affect the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or

Criminal Procedure and the Title does not affect any Federal law that requires the disclosure of

documents. The Title also does not affect any law the deals with attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection, or trade secret protection.


Section 910. Penalties


         Each tobacco manufacturer is required to act with good faith as to document disclosure.

If the Board determines that a manufacturer has not acted in good faith then it may impose certain

costs and attorney's fees on that manufacturer. The board would also be able to impose civil

penalties of up to $10,000 per violation if it determines the tobacco manufacturer acted in bad

faith.
         If a participating tobacco manufacturer fails to produce indexes and documents in accord
with the schedule outlined in this Title then a civil penalty of up to $500 may be assessed per

violation. A separate violation occurs for each document that is not produced. The maximum
penalty for a related series of violations is $10,000.

                 Subtitle A -- Tobacco Community Revitalization Trust Fund


Section 1011 - Establishment of Trust Fund


        This section establishes the "Tobacco Community Revitalization Trust Fund." The trust
fund is to be funded by assessments to tobacco manufacturers and importers as designated in
section 1012. Funds deposited into the Tobacco Community Trust Fund are to be used for the
following: payments for lost tobacco quota, payments for sale of quotas, payments for community
economic development grants, worker transition program, higher education assistance programs,
and to reimburse the federal government for the administration of the program. The legislation
includes specific dollar limitations on annual payouts for each program. All monies and payments
under the Trust Fund are deemed to constitute budget authority in advance of appropriations Acts.
 The legislation has earmarked $28.5 billion for the program, pursuant to section 1012. Of this
amount, the following annual expenditures are to be made annually for fiscal years 1999-2023:


Payments for lost tobacco quota as delineated under section 1021, except that such payments are
not exceed $1.65 billion annually, unless additional monies are needed for acceleration oflost
tobacco quota;


Payments for the administration of the tobacco support program by the Department of Agriculture
under section 1022;


Payments for the community economic development program under section 1023, which is not to
exceed $375 million annually for fiscal years 1999-2008, and $450 million annually for fiscal
years 2009-2023;



                                                      69

Payments for the worker transition program under section 1031, which is not to exceed $25
million in any fiscal year;


Payments for the higher education opportunity grants under section 1032, which are not to exceed:
$42.5 million for each of the academic years from 1999 to 2004; $50 million for each of the
academic years from 2004 to 2009; $57.5 million for each of the academic years from 2009 to
2014; $65 million for each of the academic years from 2014 to 2019; and $72.5 million for each of
the academic years from 2019 to 2024.


Section 1012 - Contributions by Tobacco Product Manufacturers and Importers


        This section specifies that contributions are to be made by tobacco manufacturers and
importers to the Tobacco Community Revitalization Trust Fund on a market share basis. The
total contribution that is to be made by companies is $28.5 billion. The payments are to be
pursuant to the following schedule: $2.1 billion annually for fiscal years 1999-2008 and $500
million annually for fiscal years 2009-2023.


                        Subtitle B - Tobacco Market Transition Assistance


Section 1021 - Payments for Lost Tobacco Quota


        This section restructures the procedures for compensating tobacco quota holders, quota
lessees, and quota tenants for lost tobacco quota as a result of declines in the tobacco market.
Tobacco quota holders, lessees, and tenants are to be compensated on a lost quota basis.
Reimbursements are to be made based on the average base quota of each party. The base quotas
are to be determined as specified:




                                                     70
                                                                       p on versIon
For quota holders, the base quota is the average tobacco fann marketing quota for the 1995-1997
marketing years.


For a quota lessee, the base quota level is fifty percent of the average number of pounds of tobacco
quota established for a farm for the 1995-1997 marketing years that was leased or rented to the
quota lessee minus twenty-five percent of the average number of pounds of that quota grown by a
quota tenant.


For a quota tenant, the base quota level is fifty percent of the average number of tobacco quota
pounds for marketing years 1995-1997 which were leased to the tenant by a quota holder and
produced by the tenant, plus twenty-five percent of the average number of tobacco quota pounds
for marketing years 1995-1997 that were leased by a quota lessee and grown by the tenant.


Monetary Reimbursements for Lost QuotalRegulations for Sale of Quotas


        The legislation has included set dollar amounts for determining the actual amount of
reimbursement due to each party in the tobacco support program. Additionally, consistent with
the Committee's desire to restructure the current quota system, so as to ensure quota owners are
actual producers, provisions have been included to encourage the transfer of quotas by quota
owners to persons who are actual producers. The Committee recognizes, however, that there are
different market conditions regarding the nation's two prominent types of tobacco -- burley and
flue-cured. Accordingly, the legislation includes separate monetary payout and quota-buyout
incentives for burley and flue-cured businesses. These procedures set out below:


                        Compensation Procedures for Burley Tobacco


        Compensation for Lost Quota. Annual payments for lost quota for persons involved in
the production of tobacco, other than flue-cured tobacco, are to made pursuant to the following
formulas:



                                                    71
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


For quota holders, payments are to be based on the number of pounds by which the farm
marketing quota is less than the base quota level for the quota holder times $4 per pound, subject
to a lifetime limitation of $8 per pound.


For lessees and tenants, the formula for determining actual payments is the percentage by which
the national marketing quota is less than the national marketing quota for marketing years
1995-1997 times the base quota level of the lessee or tenant times $4 per pound, subject to a
lifetime limitation of $8 per pound.


        If the amounts that are due to quota holders, lessees, and tenants exceed the amount
available for lost quota payments under section 1011, the actual payments are to be adjusted and
made on a pro-rata share. The amount of the reductions to each party, however, are to be
rolled-over to such succeeding fiscal years as are necessary.


        In general, payments are to be made on a yearly basis. However, payments are to be

accelerated any time the national marketing quota is below 50 percent of the national tobacco
marketing quota for the 1998 marketing year for three consecutive years, or if Congress abolishes
the tobacco support program.


        Relinquishment of Quota by Quota Holders. Burley quota holders will be given an
option to relinquish their quotas in return for a payment. Notification to exercise the option must
be made by January 15,1999. The payments to relinquishing quota holders are to be made
annually in fiscal years 1999-2008, based on a lifetime payment of $8 per pound multiplied by the
base quota level. The payments are to be made annually, and are to be equal to 1110 of the
lifetime payment. Quota holders who relinquish their quota are ineligible for any other payments
for lost or relinquishing quota.




                                                     72
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

         Reissuance of Quota. Lessees and tenants of burley quota holders are to be given a
one-year option of having an allotment of the farm or acreage marketing quota relinquished by the
quota holder relocated to a farm owned by the quota tenant or lessee. The relocated amount is not
to exceed 50% of the farm acreage owned by the quota lessee or tenant. Lessees and tenants that
receive transferred quota allotments are not to receive any additional compensation for lost quota
as a result of the reallocation. The recovery of payments as a quota holder and lessee or tenant is
prohibited.
         If the relinquished quota is not transferred to a quota lessee or tenant, the Secretary may
transfer the quota to other quota holders. Such transfers are to be limited to quota holders in the
same county, unless state law permits county-to-county transfers. Quota holders are not eligible
for additional lost quota payments to quota holders as a result of the transfer of the relinquished
quota.


         Death Of Quota Lessee or Tenant. If a quota lessee or tenant dies, his or her lost quota
'payments are to transfer to his or her spouse or dependents.




                                 Treatment of Flue-cured Tobacco


         Abolishment of Quota System for Flue-cured Tobacco. The legislation will abolish
the quota system for flue-cured tobacco. The procedures for exchange of quotas for permits are
set out in section 1024. Current quota holders who are producers, as well as lessees and tenants,
will be given the option of transitioning to the permit system. All flue-cured quota owners, who
are not actual producers, will be required to relinquish their quotas in exchange for a payment.
The quotas are to be yielded by November 15, 1998. Relinquishing quota owners are to be paid
annually 1110 of a lifetime limitation of $8 per pound times their base quota level. The payments
are to be made for fiscal years 1999-2008. The lessee or tenant of the quota will be given an
automatic option under section 1024 of obtaining a permit to continue farming. However, if the
lessee or tenant rejects the option of continuing to farm under the new permit system, each is



                                                      73
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

eligible under section 1021 for a transition payment of $8 per pound times their base quota level as
established by the legislation. The payments are to be made for fiscal years 1999-2008.


        Lost Quota Payments for Lessees and Tenants Under Permit System. Lessees and
tenants that have active pennits are eligible for annual lost quota payments of $2 per pound times
the number of pounds by which the production authorized under their pennit is less than twice
their base quota level, subject to a lifetime limitation of $4 per pound.


        If the amounts that are due to quota holders, lessees, and tenants, exceed the amount
available for lost quota payments under section 1011, the actual payments are to be adjusted and
made on a pro-rata share. The amount of reductions to each party, however, are to be rolled-over
to such succeeding fiscal years as are necessary.


        In general, payments are to be made on a yearly basis. However, payments are to be

accelerated any time the national marketing quota for flue-cured tobacco is below 50% of the
national marketing quota allotment for the 1998 marketing year for three years in a row.


Section 1022 - Industry Payments for All Department Costs Associated with Tobacco
Production


        This section authorizes the Department of Agriculture to use monies from the Tobacco
Community Revitalization Trust Fund for the administration of the tobacco support programs.


Section 1023 - Tobacco Community Economic Development Grants.


        This section authorizes the Department of Agriculture to award economic development
grants to tobacco-growing communities. The amount of the grants is to be based on the amount
of the state's fann income pursuant to the 1995-1997 marketing years. States must submit an
application to the Department before a grant can be awarded. The application is to describe the



                                                      74
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

purposes for which the grant will be used. The grants may be used for such programs as loan
assistance programs for restructuring communities or for the support of new industries. Such
funds, however, are reserved for counties in the state that had at least $100,000 in tobacco
production in one or more of the 1995-1997 marketing years. Although states are given
considerable latitude in determining the use of the grant funds, the legislation does include the
following earmarks:


        (1) at least 20% of the funds must be used for economic development and
        agriculture-based rural development activities;


        (2) a minimum of 4% is to be used for technical assistance;
        (3) no less than 6% of the funds are to be used to provide direct payments to tobacco
        warehouse owners based on declines in yearly volume sales as compared to sales during
        the 1998 marketing year.


        Additionally, a state may require recipients of funds to provide preferences in hiring
persons who, during the 1998 calendar year, were employed in farming, manufacturing, and
processing of tobacco and are eligible for assistance under the tobacco worker transition program,
as well as persons eligible for higher education grants under the bill.


Section 1024 - Flue-cured Tobacco Production Permits.


        This section replaces the tobacco quota system for flue-cured tobacco with a federal
tobacco permit system.
The federal tobacco permit system will require official permits to farm tobacco. These permits
will be issued by the Department of Agriculture, which will include production and acreage
allotment limitations. Permits will only be issued to actual producers. Lessees and tenants that
produce flue-cured tobacco under agreements with quota owners will automatically be given the
right to obtain permits to continue their farming. The permits will not be transferable, and will be



                                                      75
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


prohibited from being used as an asset. Pennits, however, will be pennitted to be transferred to
the pennit owner's surviving spouse and descendants. Lessees and tenants that have pennits that
automatically revert to them will be given the option of relinquishing their pennits for a payment.
The payments are to be made on an annual basis from 1999 to 2008, subject to a lifetime limitation
of$8 per pound times the base quota level (section 1021).


Section 1025 - Modifications in Federal Tobacco Programs.


        This section includes technical changes to the tobacco quota program. The section
provides that in cases where tobacco marketing quotas are still in effect following the enactment of
the bill, the Department of Agriculture, on receipt of a petition from 5% of the producers of a
particular type of tobacco in a state, is to conduct a statewide referendum on a proposal regarding
the lease and transfer of tobacco quota. If a majority of the state's producers of that type of
tobacco approve, the state is to implement quota transfers and leases according to the proposed
procedures.


        This section changes the penalties that are to be assessed to tobacco companies for failure
to meet quota purchase agreements. The penalty is changed from the current penalty assessment
of twice the per pound assessment times the quantity of purchasers that are less than 90% of the
quantity of intended purchases, to 105% of the average market price times the quantity of
purchasers that are less than 90% of the quantity of intended purchases.


                    Subtitle C - Farmer and Worker Transition Assistance


Section 1031 - Tobacco Worker Transition Program


        This section sets forth a program that is to be administered by the Department of Labor to
assist workers in the tobacco industry. To benefit, a group of workers of a tobacco entity will be
required to file a petition with the Labor Department for assistance. The workers will be required



                                                     76
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
to show that they (1) have or will become totally or partially separated; (2) the entity's sales
production has decreased substantially; and (3) that the national tobacco settlement contributed
importantly to the production declines. If the petition is approved, the workers are to be provided
the following benefits and services: employment services, training for new employment, and
adjustment allowances (payments to aid in the transition to a new job, except that these payments
are to be made only if the person is in the job training program). No person who has received
.payments for tobacco lost quota is eligible for the program. The program is to be funded at a rate
of$25 million yearly through fiscal year 2008. At least $12.5 million is to be used for the job
training program.


Section 1032 - Farmer Opportunity Grants.


        This section provides for the establishment of educational grants to assist tobacco
producers and their relatives in obtaining undergraduate degrees. To be eligible, a person has to
be a member of a tobacco farm family. The section defines a tobacco farm family or member as
(1) an active tobacco producer or worker, and their spouse, son, daughter, stepson, stepdaughter,
brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, son-in-law, or daughter-in-law. The bill sets forth the
following yearly amounts of the grants: $1700 for each of the academic years from 1999 to 2004;
$2000 for each of the academic years from 2004 to 2009; $2300 for each of the academic years
from 2009 to 2014; $2600 for each of the academic years from 2014 to 2019; and $2600 for each
of the academic years from 2019 to 2024. The monies are to be paid to the institution directly or
to the student. A grantee may receive a scholarship for only one institution, and is required to
maintain a qualifying average for student eligibility at the institution. A grantee is barred from
receiving a grant if he or she is in default on a higher education loan or is indebted to an institution
of higher education.


                                       Subtitle D - Immunity


Section 1041 - General Immunity for Tobacco Producers and Tobacco Warehouse Owners



                                                       77
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


         This section immunizes tobacco producers, tobacco-related growers associations, tobacco
warehouse owners and employees from any liability associated with the failure of a tobacco
product manufacturer, distributor, or retailer to comply with the national tobacco settlement
legislation.


                                       Title XI: Miscellaneous


               Subtitle A: Prohibitions Relating to Tobacco Products and Children
Section 1101. Short Title


         This subtitle may be cited as the "Tobacco Use by Minors Prevention Act".


Section 1102.     Prohibitions Relating to Tobacco Products and Children


         Section 1102 would amend Chapter VIII of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by
adding two new sections at the end of that Chapter. The Committee does not intend for these
provisions to have extraterritorial application.
         Section 804 "Prohibition on Sale or Distribution of Tobacco Products to Children" would
make in unlawful for any domestic tobacco concern to in any way contribute to the "sale or
distribution of tobacco products in a foreign country to children" or to advertise or promote
tobacco products in a foreign country in a manner that does not comply with Federal requirements
for advertising or promotion within the United States.
         Section 805, "Labeling" would make it unlawful for any domestic concern to in any way
participate in the sale of a tobacco product in a foreign country if that tobacco product does not
contain a warning label, in that country's dominant language, that complies with the Federal
labeling requirements for tobacco products sold in the United States. The only exception would
be if the Secretary determines the foreign country's labeling requirements are "substantially




                                                      78

similar" to those in the United States and those requirements are "adequately enforced" then the
domestic concern may abide by the labeling laws of the country where the tobacco product is sold.


Section 1103. Enforcement


        Enforcement would be provided under Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act.


Section 11 04. Reward


        A reward of up to $125,000 would be available to those providing information leading to
"a criminal conviction for a violation of the international sales and labeling requirements.


Section 1105. Definitions
         Section 1105 defines the term "domestic concern".


Section 1106. Amendments to Public Health Service Act
           This portion of the bill authorizes a major new medical research initiative to more
effectively prevent and treat tobacco addiction and tobacco-related diseases.
        Tobacco use kills more than 400,000 Americans each year and therefore is, according to
former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, "the chief, single avoidable cause of death in our society
and the most important public health issue of our time. " Yet despite the billions of dollars
expended each year to research diseases caused Qy tobacco addiction, only a tiny fraction of
medical research in the United States is devoted to understanding the causes of tobacco addiction,
how to decrease the number of children who start, and how to best help people to quit. As a
result, we know too little about how to prevent and treat this destructive behavior
        For example, according to a report by the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,
the National Institutes of Health (Nlli) spends less than one percent of its budget to research a
behavior that accounts for 20 percent of mortality in our nation. Despite the large increases in



                                                      79
                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
youth smoking rates and the leveling off of reductions in adult smoking, our nation's commitment
to tobacco research has increased only slightly over the last ten years. Lack of funding has
resulted in missed opportunities for advancement in tobacco control and has likely discouraged
young behavioral researchers from pursuing this area of.research. The research that does take
place on this subject at NIH is spread across numerous Institutes and is inadequately coordinated.
           Despite inadequate funding, tobacco researchers have in recent years made important
preliminary findings about the health effects of tobacco, the addictiveness of nicotine, addictive
behaviors in general, as well as treatments for cessation of tobacco use. Reflected in several
reports of the Surgeon General, as well as in medical and scientific journals, these findings have
played a vital role in the public demand for a national tobacco control policy. But much more
research is needed to inform public policy. Significant new funding is warranted to support
epidemiological, behavioral, pharmacological, health services and social services research related
to the prevention and treatment oftobacco addiction.
           An increased commitment to tobacco-related research will help save lives and tobacco--

related health care costs. For example, additional research will lead to increased knowledge about
cost-effective prevention strategies such as counter-advertising, education, and community based
activities. Enhanced research will also yield more affordable and effective cessation tools and
perhaps safer tobacco products. The Committee intends for the research initiative in the
Committee's bill to inform and ensure that the prevention programs, including the education and
counter-advertising programs as well as the cessation programs that are also included in the
Committee bill are effective and built on sound scientific evidence about how to reduce tobacco
use.
       Section 1106 of the Committee bill emphasizes the role of behavioral research in preventing
and treating addiction to tobacco products. The Committee urges that the following topics be
among those addressed by this research initiative:
                   -- Initiation. Smoking and other uses of tobacco are forms of addiction, involving
physical and psychological factors. But smoking initiation is purely behavioral. Research should
focus on why children begin to smoke and the role of such individual traits as risk taking, attitudes
toward liealth, self-perception, decision making and the impact of tobacco industry marketing on



                                                      80
                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

decisions, and how childhood and adolescent development affects these and other relevant
psychological processes.
                 -- Cessation. Not everyone tries smoking, and not everyone who tries it becomes
addicted. Some who do become addicted quit on their own. What are the protective factors in
these cases? How can those factors be encouraged in people who are at risk? It is also important
to understand the effects of smoking on behavior, such as the changes in the brain and cognitive
impairment that can result from smoking. Research is also needed on the behavioral effects of
withdrawal, which range from anger and aggre'ssion to reduced motor and cognitive functioning.
                 -- Effective strategies. Smoking initiation and cessation are both influenced by
social, economic and cultural factors. The effects of peer pressure on shaping beliefs and
behaviors, the role of family in promoting or protecting against tobacco use, and other
socially-based factors must be understood to help develop interventions that encourage and sustain
healthy behavior.
        The Committee believes that a narrow biomedical approach to tobacco addiction is short-
sighted. We must expand scientific inquiry into the behavioral aspects of smoking in order to
prevent children from smoking in the first place and to treat nicotine addiction more effectively.
In addition, behavioral research on tobacco use will help policy makers address related health

concerns, such as illicit drug abuse and underage drinking, and will help the development of
effective interventions for those risky behaviors as well.
        At the same time, the Committee anticipates that enactment of this bill will result in
sufficient new resources at the NIH to justify increased expenditures on diseases associated with
tobacco use, such as cancer and heart disease. However, it is the Committee's intent that the
NIH give the highest priority to epidemiological, behavioral and social science research on the
prevention and treatment of tobacco addiction itself. The Committee believes very strongly that
research focused on prevention and treatment of tobacco addiction will be very cost-effective and
be instrumental in reducing tobacco use and avoiding the high human and economic costs
associated with tobacco.
        The Committee recognizes that aspects of tobacco related research will occur at federal
agencies other than the NIH, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease



                                                      81

Control, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Committee expects the Secretary
of Health and Human Services acting through, among others, the Director of the Centers for
Disease Control and the Director of the new Office of Tobacco-Related Research at Nlli, to
coordinate the work of these disparate agencies.
         The Committee has also sought to spur coordination by means of the National Tobacco
Task Force established in the new section 2802 of the Public Health Service Act. The Committee
expects the Task Force, guided in part by the Institute of Medicine study mandated by the new
section 2801 of the Public Health Service Act, to prepare a national tobacco research agenda,
periodically update this agenda, and make policy recommendations based on the research findings.
         Research on the use of tobacco and its effects must take into account the needs of special
populations, especially those groups that have been targeted by the tobacco industry.
         Section 1106(a) amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new title at the end of
the Act. That title, Title xxvm, would require various research programs concerning youth
smoking.
         Section 2801, "Study By the Institute of Medicine", would require the Secretary to enter
into a contract with the Institute of Medicine "for the conduct of a study on the framework for a
research agenda and research priorities to be used by the National Tobacco Task Force". Various
considerations are outlined for the development of the this framework. The Institute of Medicine
would be required to report on its recommendations within 10 months of entering into the contract.
 Appropriations of $750,000 are authorized for this activity.
         Section 2802, National Tobacco Task Force, would require the Secretary to establish a
National Tobacco Task Force to "foster coordination" among entities undertaking tobacco-related
research. The section outlines the composition of the Task Force, its duties and the research
activities it shall undertake.
         Section 2803, Research Activities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
would require the expenditure of $4.195 Billion in research over 10 years. The funds are directed
to be taken from the Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund.




                                                     82
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

        Section 2804, Research Activities of the National Institutes of Health, would require
expenditures of$20 Billion over 10 years for research by the NIH concerning tobacco. The
Secretary would be required to establish a Tobacco-Related Research Initiative, headed by the
Director of the NIH, to provide funds to conduct research "related to the prevention and treatment
of tobacco addiction, and the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with tobacco use.
At least one-third of the funds provided must be used to address the "prevention and treatment of
addiction."
        The Director of NIH is to ensure appropriate coordination of these research efforts by
cooperating with the National Tobacco Task Force and by establishing the Office of
Tobacco-Related Research.      The Office of Tobacco-Related Research will be headed by a
director appointed by the Secretary and it shall undertake various administrative tasks to assure
appropriate research coordination.
        Section 11 06(b) of this Act further amends the Public Health Service Act by adding
further duties for the Secretary. The Secretary shall, with respect to minority health activities, seek
interagency coordination of research and monitor and then report periodically to Congress the
amount of Federal funds targeted for research related to minorities and tobacco.
        The Committee is concerned about the significant rise.in smoking among minority youth
in the U.S.   The most recent report by the Surgeon General found that smoking by high school
age Mrican Americans rose nearly 80 between 1991 and 1997, and that cigarette smoking among
Hispanic teens rose by 34 in that period.     These disturbing figures represent a growing public
health problem among many of our nation's minority citizens, and the Secretary should advise the
Congress about federal research activities targeted to remedy it.


Section 1107. Ban on Distribution o/Tobacco Products Produced by Child Labor


        This Section amends Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to include a ban on "tobacco
products produced or manufactured wholly or in part in any foreign country by child labor."


                 Subtitle B: Federal licensing of Tobacco Product Distribution


                                                      83
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion


Section 1121. Licensing of Tobacco Product Distribution


        Section 1121 provides for a program to license any "domestic concern" that manufactures
or distributes tobacco products. Tobacco retailers would not be covered by this program. Such
manufacturers and distributors would require a license from the Secretary. The fee for that
license would be $1 for every 1,000 cigarettes manufactured or distributed. Manufacturing or
distributing tobacco products without a license would be a violation of Section 30 I of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The definition of "tobacco products" would include more than
cigarettes, yet the licensing fee is based solely on a number of cigarettes.   An appropriate
conversion would be necessary to handle smokeless tobacco products.
        The Committee does not intend for this provision to have extraterritorial application.


                                Subtitle C: International Provisions


Section 1131. International Tobacco Control Trust Fund


        Section 1131 would create within the Department of the Treasury the International
Tobacco Control Trust Fund to be funded through the licensing fees established in Section 1121.
        Annual funds of$150 million will be available to the American Center on Global Health
and Tobacco from the International Tobacco Control Trust Fund. The Secretary may also use the
resources in the International Trust Fund "for grants and other forms of assistance to foreign
governments, nongovernmental organizations, and international organizations to support tobacco
control activities in foreign countries." Furthermore, the Secretary may also use resources in the
International Trust Fund to enforce "any requirements related to the sale, distribution, marketing,
or promotion of tobacco products internationally."


Section 1132.    American Center on Global Health and Tobacco




                                                      84
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
        Section 1132 would establish the American Center on Global Health and Tobacco (ACT)
"to assist organizations in other countries to reduce and prevent the use of tobacco" through public
education programs and mass media campaigns.
        ACT would be a not-for-profit corporation established within the District of Columbia and
would not be and agency or establishment of the United States.
        ACT would be funded through the creation within the National Tobacco Settlement Trust
Fund of the Global Public Health and Education Resource Account which is to be credited with
$150 million each fiscal year. The $150 million would be transferred each October 1 from the
Resource Account to ACT.
        ACT and its grantees would be subject to oversight by Congress and ACT would be
required to annually report to Congress on its activities. ACT would only be permitted to fund
private sector groups, it could not carry out programs directly. ACT's accounts are to be audited
annually by independent certified public accountants. ACT's financial transactions may also be
audited by the Comptroller General.


Section 1133.     Prohibition On Use ofFunds to Facilitate the Exportation or Promotion of
Tobacco


        Section 1133 would bar any appropriation or use of Federal funds to promote or
encourage the export, sale, distribution or advertising of tobacco products in a foreign country, or
to seek through negotiation or otherwise the removal or reduction by any foreign country of
limitations on the importation, sale, distribution or advertising of tobacco products. This
prohibition would not apply if the foreign country's restriction is "applied in a manner which
constitutes a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination between countries". To invoke this
exception the Secretary of Commerce would have to make a certification to Congress in writing
concerning the nature of the actions by the foreign country and the Secretary of HHS would have
to certify to Congress in writing that the restriction is not a "reasonable means of protecting the
public health."




                                                      85

Section 1134. Harmonization with United States International C;ommitments and Obligations


        The United States Trade Representative would be required to report to Congress, within
90 days of the Act's effectiveness, on "any provisions of this Act that are inconsistent with
obligations of the United States ... together with recommendations as to how to implement or
modify the provision without violating intemationallaw."


                          Subtitle D: Prevention of Tobacco Smuggling


Section 1141. Definitions


        Section 1141 defines terms used in this Subtitle.


Section 1142.    Tobacco Product Labeling Requirements


        Section 1142 would make it unlawful to in any way introduce into or receive from
"interstate or foreign commerce" any tobacco product that is not packaged and labeled in
conformity with the requirements of this section.
        The Secretary of the Treasury would be required to promulgate regulations to require
manufacturers of tobacco products to place a unique serial number on each package of tobacco
products so that the manufacturer and the location and date of production may be determined.
The package of each tobacco product produced for export must be labeled with the name of the
country of final destination.


Section 1143. Requirements for the Tracking of Tobacco Products


        Section 1143 would require the posting of a bond for all exports of tobacco products.
Each export would require posting with the Secretary of the Treasury: a bond that indicates the
country of final destination, a written statement from the recipient of the tobacco products that that



                                                     86

recipient will not violate any laws of that country concerning tobacco products and indicating they
have never been convicted of any offense with respect to tobacco products.
            The Secretary of the Treasury would be required to promulgate regulations to determine
the amount and frequency of each bond that must be posted. The bond, however, cannot be less
than the amount of Federal tax imposed, on tobacco products consumed in the United States,
under Chapter 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
            The Secretary of the Treasury would return a bond upon determination the tobacco
products had been received in the country of final destination as specified in the bond.


Section 1144. Tobacco Product Permits


            Section 1144 would require the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program to require
permits for all persons involved in the distribution or receipt of tobacco products in interstate or
foreign commerce. This section would not apply to retailers but retailers would need to maintain
commercial records of the receipt of tobacco products and have those records available for
inspection and audit.
            The Secretary of the Treasury would be required to demand that permit holders "keep
records concerning the chain of custody of the tobacco products that are the subject of the
permit".
Section 1145.       Prohibitions


            Section 1145 would make it unlawful, without a permit issued under Section 1144, to
import tobacco products, to engage in the business of manufacturing, packaging or warehousing
tobacco products, or to engage in the business of purchasing tobacco products for resale at
wholesale. These prohibitions are to come into effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this
subtitle.


Section 1146. Pricing and Labeling of Products Sold on Military Installations or by Native

Americans



                                                       87
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

        Section 1146(a) would require the Secretary of the Treasury, in conjunction with the

Secretary of Defense, to issue regulations to make sure the price of tobacco products sold on a

military installation is equal to the greater of the average price of the tobacco product when sold in

the nearest metropolitan area or the highest price for which the product is sold on military

installations in the United States. Tobacco products intended for sale on a military installations

would have to be labeled with that indication.

        Section 1146(b) would require that tobacco products intended for sale on an Indian

reservation be labeled with that indication.



Section 1147. Prohibition Against Sale of Tobacco Products in or to Duty-Free Shops or
Forwarding Through or Manufacture in Trade Zones


        Section 1147(a) would make it unlawful to sell any tobacco product in a duty-free shop

located in the United States or to sell to any duty-free shop.   Section 1147(b) would make it

unlawful to forward through or manufacture a tobacco product in any foreign trade zone.



Section 1148. Jurisdiction; Penalties; Compromise ofLiability


        Federal District Courts have jurisdiction for suits brought by the Attorney General to
prevent or restrain violations of any of the provisions of this subtitle.

        In any conviction of the provisions of this subtitle, the provisions of section 3571 of Title

18 U.S.C. will apply as if the person were convicted of a felony under that title.

        The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to compromise the liability arising from a

violation of this subtitle upon payment of fine not to exceed $10,000 per violation. In the case of

repetitious violations and in order to avoid multiple criminal violations the United States may enter

a consent decree to enjoin the repetition of the violation.



Section 1149. Amendments to the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act



                                                       88

         Section 1149 would amend the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act in the following key
ways: to have the Act apply to more than cigarettes by defining tobacco products to include cigars,
cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and pipe tobacco; to lower the threshold amount of tobacco product
which triggers the Act from 60,000 units to 30,000 units; to add prohibitions on knowingly failing
to maintain distribution records, altering or obliterating required markings, or interfering with an
inspection; and, by making it unlawful to knowingly transport tobacco products under a false bill
of lading or without a bill of lading. Any proceeds from the unlawful distribution of tobacco
products would be subject to seizure and forfeiture.


Section 1150. Authorization ofAppropriations


         Such sums as are necessary to carry out this subtitle are authorized for appropriations.


                                  Subtitle E: Antitrust Exemption.


Section 1161..     Limited Antitrust Exemption


         Section 1161 would provide a limited antitrust exemption for participating tobacco
manufactures to facilitate actions in conjunction with this Act. This limited exemption is
necessary to proted certain business agreements by tobacco companies, as recommended by the
State Attorneys General who negotiated the original tobacco settlement. The Ad requires
cooperation by tobacco companies regarding certain pricing, advertising, and compliance adivities,
in order to ensure a uniform and comprehensive national policy to regulate tobacco products in the
public interest.   Without a limited antitrust exemption, agreements by the tobacco companies to
adopt similar pricing and advertising policies could be subjed to antitrust challenges.




  Subtitle F: Special Provisions Concerning Programs for Women, Minorities, and Others



                                                       89

Section 1171.    Research Related to Patterns of Smoking by Women and Minorities


        Research funded by this Act should where appropriate to the "scope and purpose
investigation, include data and analysis with respect to different factors that may be present in the
·case of women or minorities."
        Research funded under this Act to examine patterns of smoking among minorities "should
be conducted in proportion to their prevalence in the smoking population and shall be conducted at
minority education institutions, where available, or institutions that provide the greatest amount of
health care to minority populations in a State.


Section 1172. Counter-Advertising Programs


        Section 1172 would require the Secretary to carry out programs to reduce tobacco usage to
"discourage the use of tobacco products by individuals and to encourage those who use such
products to quit. To receive assistance through these programs an entity would apply to the
Secretary and meet such eligibility requirements as the Secretary establishes. Funds necessary to
carry out this section will be provided from the funds made available under Title IV of this Act.


Section 1173. Prevention Activities of Community and Migrant Health Centers
        Section 1173 would provide $3 billion over 10 years from the National Tobacco Trust
Fund to Community and Migrant Health Centers to "provide health services for diseases related to
tobacco and to prevent tobacco-related diseases.


                                  Subtitle G: Sense of the Senate


        Subtitle G provides a list of purposes for which it would be the sense ofthe Senate that the
proceeds of this Act may be applied. The Sense of the Senate would not limit the application of
the proceeds to other purposes.

    Subtitle H: Ban on Sale of Tobacco Products Through the Use of Vending Machines


Section 1191. Ban o/Sale o/Tobacco Products Through the Use o/Vending Machines


           The Committee is concerned about the fact that vending machines may represent a
potential source of unrestricted access to cigarettes for underage youths.   While a ban on tobacco
vending machines enhances the Act's comprehensive program to prevent youth smoking, it also
raises issues of economic injury and job loss to our nation's vending machine industry.

           The vending machine industry relies heavily on revenues from the sales of tobacco.

products.     There are over 2,000 vending machine companies spread throughout the U.S., most of
them small, family-owned operations.      The vending machine industry employs an estimated

10,000 individuals, over one-third of them minority citizens.    There are an estimated 350,000
commercial vending machines in operation in the U.S.       Vending machine industry representatives

advised the Committee that 25 of these companies rely solely on the sale of tobacco products in
their business operations, and that tobacco products produce the large majority of sales and profits

for the remaining 75 of vending machine businesses.
           SectiDn 1191 wDuld ban the use Df vending machines to. sell tDbaccD products, effective

                            Title XII: Tobacco Asbestos Trust Fund


        Scientific evidence suggests that asbestos related health problems are greatly facilitated
and enhanced by cigarette smoking. As a result, those injured by asbestos also believe they
should be able to seek compensation for their damages from tobacco manufacturers.


Section 1201. Definitions


        Section 1201 defines relevant terms used in this title.


Section 1202. Tobacco Asbestos Trust Fund


        Section 1202 would establish in the United States Treasury a Tobacco Asbestos Trust
Fund. There would be five trustees, two appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to represent the interests of asbestos trusts and asbestos defendants, and two appointed by
the Secretary of Labor to represent asbestos claimants and labor unions with claimants as
members, and one chosen by the other four, who shall be a health care professional with expertise
in asbestos disease.
        The Trust Fund receives funds from assessments made by the Secretary of the Treasury on
the tobacco industry. The Trust would receive a total of$20 billion by the end of2014.
        Funds may be paid out of the Trust Fund only to victims harmed by tobacco and asbestos.
        The Trust Fund is divided into two equal funds - Fund I and Fund ll. Fund I would be
administered by three trustees: the two appointed by the Secretary ofHHS, and the health
professional. Fund II would be administered by three trustees: the two appointed by the Secretary
of Labor, and the health professional.
        Fund I would assign credits to asbestos defendants and trusts in proportion to their past
payments to claimants for tobacco-caused harm. The asbestos defendants, however, do not
receive any funds. Rather, they may direct the Trust to use such funds to pay asbestos claims.



                                                     92
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
         Fund II is used to pay the tobacco-caused portion of future tobacco/asbestos claims. The
funds available to the Trust are allocated equally between Fund I and Fund II, but the trustees of
Fund II may provide an advance from Fund II as a loan to Fund I.


Section 1203.    Payments From Fund I


         In order to determine the allocation of credits within Fund I, the trustees shall request that

all asbestos trusts and defendants provide information as to the amount of payments or settlements
of asbestos claims made by or on behalf of the defendants and trusts, and all bonded judgements as
of the date of enactment. The trustees shall establish credits base on each trust's or defendant's
payments as a percentage of the total. The trustees shall include twenty percent of unpaid
settlements. In no event shall the total of the credits relating to these unpaid settlements constitute
more than six percent of the total of Fund I.
         Credits may be used only for the payment of asbestos claims. None of the credits may be
used for the payment of corporate dividends, reimbursements of insurers, or any other corporate
purpose.
         An asbestos defendant may use a credit to direct payment from Fund I to any asbestos

claimant. An asbestos trust shall use its credits for payment to victims according to the rules of
the trust.


Section 1204. Payments From Fund II
         Section 1204 would establish the rules for payment of funds out of Fund II. The trustees
of Fund II would be required to establish the following: rules ensuring that funds can only be used
for the portion of harm caused by tobacco to an asbestos claimant; rules ensuring that future and
current claimants are treated equally, and in the event that future demands require limitations on
current payments, those with the most serious disease or disability get priority; criteria establishing
a minimum degree of asbestos-related disability or impairment for a claimant to receive
compensation; criteria to establish an optional claims handling mechanism for asbestos caused
harm in accordance with the Louisiana Agreement Providing Administrative Alternative for



                                                      93

Claimants with Asbestos Related Conditions; rules to insure fair and equitable administration of
the claims process, including attorneys' fees; and, rules requiring Fund II recipients to execute a
release of C!lliiability for tobacco-caused harm.


Section 1205. Transfers from National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund.


        To provide the funds that would be needed under Section 1202, the Secretary of the
Treasury would each year transfer from the National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund with certain
indicated amounts to a total of $21 billion by the year 2014.


Section 1206. Rules for Claims Against Asbestos Trusts, Asbestos Defendants, and Tobacco
Companies


         Section 1206 indicates the general purpose of the title is to ensure that asbestos claimants
and asbestos/tobacco claimants receive compensation in a fair and timely manner.
        Before a lawsuit for harm caused by tobacco and asbestos can proceed to trial or
judgement, the plaintiff must submit a claim to Fund II for the tobacco-caused portion of the harm.
 The plaintiff would receive a determination within 120 days, or earlier if exigent circumstances
exist. A claimant who rejects an offer from, or is denied an award by, Fund II may proceed to
trial or judgement in a tort action.
        A claimant who accepts an award from Fund II must execute a release of liability for all
tobacco-caused harm.
         Tobacco companies shall not be liable to asbestos trusts and defendants for claims arising
from payments or obligations for payments to asbestos/tobacco claimants made or incurred prior to
the date of enactment. Any existing lawsuits based on such claims are extinguished. For claims
subsequent to the date of enactment, asbestos trusts and defendants may aggregate and establish
them based on valid statistical proof of relative causation for each disease category.
        A claimant who accepts an award from Fund II may not sue for tobacco-caused harm. A
claimant who rejects an award may sue asbestos defendants for asbestos and tobacco harm in



                                                      94
                                              .      Hex.Dump Conversion

accordance with other applicable law. An asbestos defendant that pays for tobacco-caused harm
may succeed to the claimant's rights to request compensation from Fund II, or may bring an
indemnity or contribution action against a tobacco company.
        In an asbestos action where the claimant had exposure to tobacco, the trier of fact must

apportion the relative causation between asbestos and tobacco. The apportionment may be
determined based upon valid statistical data.
        Nothing in this legislation shall limit any existing joint liability among asbestos trusts or
defendants for asbestos-caused harm, limit anyone's ability to claim disability caused by asbestos,
or delay resolution of a claim.




                                   Title XIII: Veterans' Benefits


Section 1301. Recovery By Secretary of Veterans Affairs


        Section 1301 would amend Title 38 of the United States Code by adding "Part VII:
Recovery of Compensation Costs for Tobacco-Related Disability or Death.
        Section 9101 of that Part VII would permit the Secretary of Veteran's Affairs to sue
tobacco manufacturers for cost of compensation to be paid to veterans for their smoking related
injuries associated with their military service.
        The funds recovered from such suits would be paid into a revolving fund in the United
States Treasury. The fund would be called the Department of Veterans Affairs Tobacco Recovery

veterans benefit programs, including administrative costs.
        Section 9102 of Part VII would allow the Secretary to establish procedures to determine
the present value of future benefits paid to a veteran in compensation of smoking related injury.
No action taken by the Secretary to seek compensation from the tobacco manufacturers would
"operate to deny the injured veteran ... the recovery for that portion of his or her damage not
covered" by compensation through the Veterans Administration.

        Section 9104 would exclude any sums recovered through this Title by the Secretary from
the annual limitations of damages available to participating manufacturers.


                                  Statement of Committee Intent


        The Committee is working on additional amendments to S. 1415. These amendments
would be offered on the Senate floor to make further technical and conforming changes, as well as
substantive modifications to further improve the bill and to remedy language that does not
correspond with the Committee's intent.
        The Committee intends that any further amendments would be adopted by the Senate and
considered as original text for purposes of amendment.

                         ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF MR. HOLLINGS


        I acknowledge that some believe it is necessary to have provisions in a comprehensive
tobacco bill that relate to the international aspects of tobacco sales. However, I am concerned
with the constitutionality and extraterritorial application of some of the international provisions of
this bill. Ultimately, any such provisions must be constitutional, administrable, and not result in
the loss of American jobs or harm to American farmers.


ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF SENATOR TED STEVENS AND SENATOR CONRAD
BURNS
        The Committee includes payments to the Federal Black Lung Program on the Sense of the
Senate list of purposes to which the proceeds from the tobacco legislation may be used.


        Epidemiological evidence strongly suggests that cigarette smoking is correlated to the
decline in lung function of miners exposed to coal dust who now receive payments from the
Federal Black Lung Program. The Committee therefore adopted the Sense of the Senate that



                                                      96
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

proceeds from the tobacco legislation may be used for payments to the Federal Black Lung

Program.


           In 1985, the Surgeon General of the United States (c. Everett Koop) reported that "since

the introduction of more effective controls to reduce the levels of coal dust exposure at the
worksite, cigarette smoking has become the more significant contributor to reported cases of
disabling airflow obstruction among coal miners" ... and further, that "the prevalence of
ventilatory disabilities in coal miners could be substantially reduced by reducing the prevalence of
cigarette smoking, and efforts aimed at reducing ventilatory disability should include efforts to
enhance successful smoking cessation."


           Since the Surgeon General's Report, numerous medical and scientific studies have
documented the direct relationship between cigarette smoking and black lung disease or
pneumoconiosis.       U.S. Department of Labor statistics reveal that non-smoking coal miners rarely
are awarded disability compensation from the Black Lung Trust Fund while a substantial majority
of black lung claimants who have received federal benefits are cigarette smokers. Medical
studies have in fact reported "that the effect of (cigarette) smoking is five times that of coal dust"
on decline in lung function while having "five to ten times greater negative effect on ventilatory
capacity than coal dust." In short, the Federal Black Lung Program is likely paying for harm
caused, in part, by cigarette smoking.    Current estimates indicate that an infusion of $15 billion
dollars from the tobacco industry would help keep the federal programs working for black lung
victims.


           We recommend, in light of the relationship between cigarette smoking and coal workers
pneumoconiosis, and the fact that Federal Black Lung Programs have paid almost $60 billion in
medical and disability benefits to those afflicted beneficiaries, that the tobacco industry should also
contribute to the Federal Black Lung Program. We therefore recommend that adequate funding
be allocated from revenues from tobacco legislation to ensure the solvency of the Federal Black
Lung Program and to provide for future benefits.

Additional Views of Senator Spencer Abraham: Explanation of Selected Votes


        Now that the Committee has reported out tobacco settlement legislation -- legislation that I
know will require more work on the floor -- I 'would like to comment on several of the more
important votes that took place in Committee.
        One of several contentious issues that arose during the mark-up was the amendment
offered by Senator Snowe proposing to codify the provisions in the tobacco agreement relating to
advertising and marketing by the tobacco companies. The problem with the Snowe amendment is
that the vast majority of legal scholars agree that the amendment, by definition, is unconstitutional.
The tobacco agreement negotiated between the tobacco companies and the attorneys general from
various states was a very complex amalgam of legal and policy issues. To bring the agreement to
fruition will require a number of actions, including laws passed by Congress (and obviously signed
by the President) and executive branch directives. In addition, because the tobacco companies
had
expressed a willingness to curtail, voluntarily, many advertising and marketing tactics that are
entirely legal under the Supreme Court's interpretation of commercial free speech, the tobacco
companies also would have been required to enter into a consent decree in which they would agree
to cease such constitutionally protected activities. In other words, what they could not be
compelled to do through legislative or executive action, they have agreed to do voluntarily in order
to obtain other aspects of the tobacco agreement.
        By codifying these provisions via the Snowe amendment, Congress would have seriously
risked "torpedoing" the entire tobacco agreement by preemptively and -- as most observers
agree -- unconstitutionally restricting the companies' rights to advertise and market their products.
Primarily out of constitutional concerns, the committee defeated the Snowe amendment on a 5-14
vote, and I voted against it on those grounds as well.
        Several votes also occurred with respect to amendments offered by Senator Ashcroft on
important legal reform issues, and they deserve some mention as well.       I continue to be a strong
advocate of legal reform, but it is important to include only reforms that belong in this legislation.



                                                         98
                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

        Senator Ashcroft first offered as an amendment to the tobacco settlement legislation the
text of the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act, which the Committee had already reported out this
Congress as part of product liability reform legislation. That amendment failed by a vote of 3-13,
with the Committee members who spoke in opposition to it indicating that they supported the
substance of the amendment but did not think that the place for it was on this legislation. I
supported that amendment, however. Such important health-related legislation as the biomaterials
bill would be appropriate to include as part of tobacco settlement legislation, and, in my view,
should in fact be directly linked to and included in the legislation.
        While I support the substance of product liability reform legislation and broader civil
justice reform generally, I did not support Senator Ashcroft's second amendment, which was
defeated by a vote of 2-16, to add the entire product liability reform legislation to this bill. That
legislation has already been reported out of the Commerce Committee. Moreover, it has been and
still is the subject of sensitive negotiations, and also deals with a broad array of products that do
not necessarily have anything to do with health. Including such legislation here would have only
complicated an already difficult issue with a matter that the Committee has already dealt with
separately.
        Finally, Senator Ashcroft and Senator Dorgan both offered slightly different amendments
to remove all liability limits from the tobacco legislation. Each was defeated by a wide margin. I
opposed those amendments because the carefully circumscribed liability limits developed by the
Chairman were central to the legislation that he was able to put together with sufficient support to
be reported out of Committee. Nonetheless, Senator Ashcroft makes a valid point that if the
Congress is not willing to grant liability protections to businesses and individuals that make and
market safe and useful products, then perhaps Congress should not be protecting cigarette
manufacturers, who produce a harmful product that contributes to the deaths of millions of
Americans each year.
        Passage of Senator Ashcroft's efforts, while well-intentioned, would simply have
prevented any tobacco settlement legislation from moving forward.       The Chairman was able to
put together a piece of legislation on this complex and controversial issue only through striking a
delicate balance. It is important for the Committee to move forward at this point and to report out



                                                       99
                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

tobacco settlement legislation so that the full Senate will have the opportunity to consider it this
Session.


Views of Senator Ron Wyden


This bill takes an historic step toward reducing the negative health consequences of
tobacco on future generations of Americans. It provides a comprehensive approach to
addressing the problems of advertising and labeling at home and abroad, establishes
youth smoking goals and addresses the unique concerns of tobacco farmers.


Accountability


As we address the problem of youth smoking and changing the behavior oftobacco
companies, it is important that there be an objective body that can report on the success or
failure of those changes. The Accountability Panel will be the only "watch-dog"
apparatus available to detennine company specific behavior. It will report annually on
the success or failure of specific company behavior in meeting the public health goal of
this bill -- reducing youth smoking.


At any time, the panel may recommend a specific company's liability protections be
removed because the company's behavior is significant enough to hinder the achievement
of youth smoking reduction goals. By creating the only link between public health and
the company's continued receipt of its' liability protection, the Accountability Panel will
serve as a trigger to protect public health. This linkage will force the individual
company to earn those protections. In addition, should action be initiated to remove
liability protections, whether a company has adopted the panel's recommendations can be
considered during the deliberations. Company specific accountability is even more
important because the look back provisions are established on an industry-wide basis in
this legislation.


                                                     100
                                           Hex-Dump Conversion


The Accountability Panel would be composed of career public health officials, including
a voice for minority communities that were targeted by tobacco companies. As
unanticipated technology and behavior changes occur, this panel will provide the
mechanism to identify the impact of specific company's behavior that we cannot now
predict. Under this bill, only the Accountability Panel will provide an ongoing record of
company specific behavior to reduce youth smoking with the power to recommend
ending a company's liability protections.


Minority Health


This bill is the first serious attempt to resolve minority health issues related to tobacco.
While consumers are targeted every day by companies, the targeting of minorities and
women by tobacco companies resulted in the lives of many individuals and families being
decimated by smoking-related diseases. The importance of research and providing
smoking prevention and cessation programs for minority communities cannot be
understated. Research must focus on developing successful cessation programs and
smoking-related minority health concerns. In addition, prevention and cessation
programs should be culturally and linguistically appropriate; cessation programs must be
affordable and community-based, including community health centers to reach migrant
populations and others who might not have regular sources of health care.


International Tobacco Control


Another important aspect of this bill are the provisions that relate to international tobacco
control. Nothing in these provisions is intended to prevent the U.S. government or
tobacco companies themselves from working with other nations to develop strict
standards against marketing to children. Through a code of conduct, restrictions on U.S.
government institutions to promote tobacco exports, labeling and marketing standards,


                                                 101
                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
anti-smuggling efforts and the creation of a non-governmental organization to focus on
tobacco control in developing nations, this bill ensures that any U.S. tobacco settlement is
not paid for by selling tobacco to children overseas.


As one-in-three cigarettes produced in the U.S. is currently exported, the issue of the
U.S. establishing a strong position concerning international tobacco control is critical to
public health and as a foreign policy goal. The World Health Organization (WHO)
projects that one-third of the world's population over the age of 15 currently smokes --
equivalent to 1.1. billion smokers. Over 90 percent of the smokers are located outside
the U.S., and 70 percent live in developing countries.


It has been demonstrated repeatedly that when a U.S. tobacco company enters a foreign
market, overall consumption of cigarettes increases in that country. In Taiwan and
Japan, U.S. brands jumped from one percent of the market to 20 percent in less than two.
years. U.S. tobacco companies, like other companies, know the image of the U.S. sells
their products overseas. We should insure that image our national image is not used to
promote tobacco products to children overseas.


Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS)


This legislation sets a tough standard against environmental tobacco smoke, but creates
exceptions for some public places and allows states to opt out of the standard completely.
 There should be no option for states to opt out. ETS causes or exacerbates a wide range
of adverse health effects, including cancer, respitory infections and asthma. ETS
contains over 4000 chemical; 200 are poisons; 43 cause cancer. The Environmental
Protection Agency has classified ETS as a known cause of cancer in human. Because
one of the primary goals of this legislation is the health of children, it is unfortunate that
the bill would allow ETS to harm children.




                                                  102
                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

The Building Owners and Managers Association International have correctly stated that
this provision as written gives the states the ability to "just say no" to protections against
ETS. The opportunity to remove a significant health hazard should not be lost.




Look Back Provisions and Penalties to Reduce Youth Smoking


While this bill sets reasonable goals for reductions in youth smoking rates, it permits
tobacco companies to miss the targets by 20 percentage points. In addition, while the
penalties in a cumulative sense may appear large, they are capped and amount to a
graduated cost to the company ranging from under one-third of a penny-a-pack to just a
penny-per-pack.


The penalties, combined with the look back provision based on an industry-wide basis are
not enough. Companies must be held accountable. One way to do that is to establish
company specific look-backs and penalties.       In addition, the current provision may
result in smaller tobacco companies bearing a larger share of the burden than their market
share, should other, larger companies not succeed in reducing youth smoking.


An amendment, which was offered in mark-up but was withdrawn, would have provided
company-specific look back provisions, and imposed greater reductions in youth smoking
goals. From a public health perspective, this approach would be better than the
provisions of the current bill. Look back provisions should be on a
company-by-company basis in order to achieve accountability for bad actors and to learn
what strategies work for different companies in achieving reductions in youth smoking.
Greater penalties should be required for missing those targets. Finally, language to
assure minority children are appropriate counted in any look-back provisions would have
been preferable.




                                                 103
Conclusion                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


Although some provisions of this bill could be strengthened, the Committee's product is
comprehensive and provides the opportunity for Congress to take historic action to reduce
one of the known preventable health problems. In doing so, Congress would increase the
health status of all our communities and reduce the long-term health care costs for
smoking-related diseases.


Additional Views by Chairman McCain



        The Committee is working on additional amendment to S. 1415. These amendment
would be offered on the floor to make further technical and conforming changes, as well as

substantive modifications to further improve the bill and to remedy language that does not
correspond with Committee intent.



        The Committee intends that any further amendments would be adopted by the Senate and
considered as original text for purpose of amendment.



ADDITIONAL VIEWS ON FUNDING


        The Committee intends that precise funding level for the administration, enforcement and

implementation of this act be developed in consultation with the full Senate and the administration
prior to and during floor consideration of S.1415.


        While in certain cases funding amounts are identified in the legislation, the Committee

recognizes that precise funding level must be reconciled with the needs, priorities and purposes of

this Act.
            The Committee intends to ensure that amounts reserved or authorized for any purpose are

fully prioritized, justified and fiscally responsible.

SPIT TOBACCO

           During the Executive Session on S. 1415 the Committee adopted an amendment by

Senator Ford regarding small tobacco manufacturers.          This amendment contained a formula by

which spit tobacco is equated in volume to cigarettes for purpose of manufacturer payments and

pricing.

           The Committee subsequently learned that the effect of the amendment would be to reduce

the price increase on spit tobacco pursuant to this act. Spit tobacco poses a substantial health risk

to youth. It is the Committee's intent that the price of spit tobacco rise commensurately with

cigarettes to effectively deter youth consumption. The Committee will work on a further

amendment to repair this serious problem with the reported bill.



NATNE AMERICANS

           A fundamental debate in the course of drafting tobacco regulatory policy for our nation

has centered on the question of a potential unregulated tobacco loophole in Indian country.

Throughout the course of developing this tobacco proposal, I have respected the inherent authority

of Indian tribes in the same manner as we do state governments. Certainly, no one disagrees that

the intent and scope of this bill applies to the regulation of tobacco related activities of Indian

tribes and their members while providing the necessary protections to Indian children from the

dangers of tobacco.



           It is clear that "Indian country" is an anomaly to many in the Congress and to the general

public. Indeed, the course of federal policy with respect to Indian tribes has further convoluted

the national sentiment toward tribal governments, with the actions of the Congress creating a

matrix of regulatory laws and jurisdictional complexity. It is this intricate nature of federal policy

and tribal governance which compels our fair and deliberative consideration of any policy we

develop which affects mUltiple jurisdictional authorities.




                                                      105
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

         An attempt was made in Section 604 of Title VI to broadly treat what has been interpreted
as a tax evasion issue in Indian country in the collection of state taxes to non-members who buy
cigarette products on tribal lands or from tribal retailers. However, a fundamental flaw exists
within Section 604 to achieve this objective to "eliminate pricing disparity" as a "basic function of

the Act."


         I note that although "eliminating pricing disparity" is a "basic function of the Act," this is
not an absolute objective.       For example, each of the fifty states retain their ability to set their own
cigarette tax rates notwithstanding the near certainty that this will result in significant (perhaps
dramatic) interstate price disparities.    In short, the national objective of uniformity pauses to
recognize the sovereign nature of the state governments, in that states are permitted to establish
their own tax rates, even if those rates frustrate and impede the policies of neighboring states.
Indian tribal governments, however, are not to be afforded the same respect and discretion with
regard to cigarette tax rates.


         The Supreme Court has recognized that deference must be paid to the sovereign status of
Indian tribal governments.       Specifically, in Washington v. ColviUe, 447 U.S. 134 (1980) the
Supreme Court stopped far short of endorsing the state's authority to "enter onto the reservations,
seize stocks of cigarettes which are intended for sale to nonmembers, and sell theses stocks to
nonmembers, and sell these stocks in order to obtain payment of the taxes due."            The Court
determined that the state's ability to take this action was not properly before the Court, but
nevertheless, did recognize that seizure of on-reservation cigarettes was "considerably different"
from the state's ability to seize off-reservation cigarettes "where state power over Indian affairs is
considerably more expansive than it is within reservation boundaries."          The Court explained that
off-reservation seizure of cigarettes "polices against wholesale evasion of [state] taxes without
unnecessarily intruding on core tribal interests."


         Because of the federal trust responsibility to Indian tribes and their members, Congress has
a strong responsibility to protect such "core tribal interests" even while seeking to achieve other



                                                          106
                                  .       Hex-Dump Conversion

federal objectives.   In addition, Congress must consider these interests when enacting legislation or
it risks judicial invalidation of these provisions, just as it must be solicitous of federalism concerns
or it risks similar judicial invalidation.


         I am concerned that some interpretation of Section 604 could result in a violation of the
federal government's trust obligation to tribes.    Specifically, where tribes and states have negotiated
agreements providing for the collection of state taxes, there is simply no rational basis for Congress
to de facto invalidate these agreement, arrangements, or state laws simply because some tribes ~nd
states have not worked out such satisfactory arrangements.        Of course, Section 604 need not be
read to necessarily invalidate these freely negotiated arrangements.      I am sure that no one believes
the Treasury Department should implement this provision in a manner that preempts state law or
tribal-state voluntary agreements.


         Second, the provision should not be interpreted to impose state taxes on transactions that
are otherwise exempt from state taxes.       For example, in Co/viDe, the Court found that in some
circumstances states must credit tribes for the amount of tribal taxes applicable to transactions
between tribes and nonmembers.          The Supreme Court has encouraged Congress to address both
sides of the tribal-state taxing equation: equity to tribes and states.   Section 604 seeks to resolve
state concerns without considering legitimate issues raised by Indian tribes.


         If eliminating pricing disparities for those products is indeed a paramount objective of the
proposed tobacco legislation, fundamental fairness as well as a desire to realistically achieve such an
end require that uniform application of the principal be proposed.        Short of that, the disparate
treatment accorded tribal and state governments cannot be maintained as an equitable principal and
will not succeed as a practical matter.


         In my home state of Arizona, the state tax law does not apply to tribal or individual tribal
retailers located on Indian reservations where the tribal government imposes a commensurate tax.
Twelve tribes in the state enacted their own cigarette tax and the state has cooperative agreements



                                                        107
                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

with three other tribes which authorize the. state to ad as the tax collector for the tribe.      I note that
the State of Nevada enaded legislation in 1979 which authorizes tribes of the state to collect a tribal
sales tax in lieu of the state sales tax, provided that the tax was equal to or greater than the
commensurate state tax.      This applies to cigarette sales.   The tribes utilize the revenue from the
tribal sales tax for governmental services and benefits for their tribal members.       State-tribal tax
agreements are operating in several states and tribes are operating pursuant to state laws in others.


         In conclusion, I am most concerned with the provision for two reasons.             First, as the
CoviUe decision shows, even with respect to transadions between tribes and non-Indians, not all
state retail sales are applicable.   If this provision is interpreted to impose all state taxes, then this
Committee has taken drastically needed tax revenues from this Nation's poorest citizens.            Second,
this provision should not be interpreted to discourage tribal-state agreements.        There are far more
examples of tribal-state cooperation than conflict in the field of tribal-state taxation.     Our legislation
should build on such cooperation and not nullify the fruits of cooperation.
