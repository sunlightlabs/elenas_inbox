                       DATE:          July 23, 1998
                       LOCATION:      Oval Office
                       TIME:          3:00 PM EDT
                       FROM:          Mike McCurry &
                                      Megan Moloney
I. PURPOSE

       This event will give you an opportunity to outline your plans
       for dealing with the immediate crisis affecting America's
       farms, point out areas where Congress has failed to act, and
       to speak more broadly about your agenda for rural America.
       You will discuss these issues first with Members of Congress
       in the Roosevelt Room. You will then participate in a
       conference call with 7 farm broadcasters on the same issue.
II.    BACKGROUND

       For five and a half years, you have worked to expand
       opportunity for rural Americans and farm families. The
       Administration has helped farmers manage risk and address
       market volatility; provided critical disaster assistance to
       rural homeowners, farm owners, and business owners, as well
       as to ranchers who have lost livestock; expanded U.S.
       agricultural exports; improved our school lunch programs by
       buying surplus commodities; and worked to diversify the
       sources of enterprise and income in rural America.

       But rural America still faces challenges -- with the economic
       crisis in Asia weakening some of our best customers for farm
       products, strong world crop production bringing prices down,
       and farmers facing floods and fires and drought and crop
       disease.




       Today you will announce important steps to address these
       challenges.

                 Expands the rural economy through exports and
            development;
                 Improves the farm income safety net;
                 Strengthens our rural infrastructure by
            improving transportation, protecting universal
            service, and improving our schools; and
                 Promotes health and welfare for rural America
       2)   policy to exempt food exports from U.S. sanctions
