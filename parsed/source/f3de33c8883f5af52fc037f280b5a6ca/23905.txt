                Improvements to the Senate Juvenile Crime Legislation


   Three out of four "core mandates" preserved. Senator Hatch's bill originally
    weakened all of the core protections for juveniles in state custody. The bill that cleared
    the Senate today preserves language in current law ensuring that juveniles are separated
    by sight and sound from adults while incarcerated; that they are not placed in adult jails;
    and that status offenders are not incarcerated. However, the bill does re-write
    protections against disproportionate minority confinement. A KennedyIW ellstone
    amendment to drop this provision was defeated, and this issue will have to be revisited in
    conference.

   Guaranteed prevention funds. The original Hatch bill provided almost no funds for
    prevention. The bill that passed today sets asiqe 25 percent of the $450 million Juvenile
    Accountability Block Grant for prevention, and authorizes a separate $435 million for
    other delinquency and prevention programs.

   No new death penalties. The original Hatch bill made l6-year olds eligible for the
    federal death penalty. This provision has been dropped.

   Onerous conditions on states deleted. To be eligible for the new block grant funds, the
    original Hatch bill required states to pass new laws to prosecute juveniles (14-year olds)
    as adults. These hard requirements have been dropped and replaced with more
    reasonable conditions requiring graduated sanctions, drug testing and protection of
    victims rights in cases involving juvenile offenders.

   Federalization clause dropped. The original Hatch bill included a presumption that all
    juvenile crime should be federal and then referred to states as appropriate. Chief Justice
    Rehnquist complained bitterly last year about this provision, and it is no longer in the bill.

   New gun provisions. The original Hatch bill contained no provision to address gun
    violence. As you know, the new bill: (1) requires background checks for all gun sales at
    gun shows; (2) requires gun dealers to provide child safety locks with every handgun
    sold; (3) bans the juvenile possession of assault weapons and large capacity clips; (4)
    expands the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative; (5) bans the importation oflarge
    capacity ammunition clips; (6) prohibits violent juveniles from possessing guns (but in a
    weaker form than your own proposal); and (7) provides $50 million for the increased
    federal prosecution of gun crimes.
