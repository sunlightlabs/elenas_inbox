Talking Points:
 The Fundamentals of           President Clinton's FY 2000 Budget:
          Investing in the Future while Maintaining Fiscal Discipline


A Return to Fiscal Strength:

      The 2000 budget anticipates the third consecutive budget surplus -- the first time we have
       seen back-to-back-to-back surpluses in half a century.

      Our remarkable fiscal and economic strength -- a balanced budget and unprecedented
       economic prosperity, including unemployment and inflation at a three decade low and
       homeownership at a record high -- is not an accident.

      The President began this virtuous cycle with his 1993 economic plan, founded on
       reducing the deficit, making strategic investments in the American people, and engaging
       in the international economy. In 1992, the budget deficit stood at a record $290 billion.
       Now we have achieved balance and can anticipate surpluses for decades to come.

Balancing Strategic Investments for the Future with Fiscal Discipline:

      The President's 2000 budget adopts the same framework that has lead to our fiscal and
       economic success. It advances strategic investments and maintains fiscal discipline.

      The 2000 budget, with its many important priorities and initiatives in education and
       training, research, the environment, health, childcare and other programs for families,
       economic development, law enforcement, foreign policy and defense -- is fully paid for. It
       complies with budget rules that have served as tools to help enforce fiscal discipline; it
       meets the discretionary caps on spending and the pay-as-you-go budget rules.

      Our challenge as we move forward to the next century is to maintain the same fiscal
       discipline that led to this budgetary and economic success, while continuing strategic
       investments in the American people that will strengthen our nation for the future, and
       benefit the next generation.

      As the President suggested in his State of the Union address two weeks ago, this is
       defining moment that will greatly determine the character of our country at the end of the
       21st century. We can build on this strong fiscal foundation, or we can sweep it away.

Use the Surplus to Save Social Security First:

      We must save Social Security First. The President has already committed 62 per cent of
       our projected budget surplus for the next 15 years -- enough to extend Social Security's
       solvency to 2055. He is calling for a bipartisan process for additional reforms to extend
                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
      solvency through 2075.



     After we achieve Social Security reform, the budget makes further commitments of the
      surplus for strategic investment priorities to strengthen the nation for the future.

     The President proposes to dedicate 15 percent of the surplus to the Medicare trust fund,
      whose financial security is threatened even sooner than Social Security. In 1997, the
      President and the Congress worked together to make Medicare financially sound through
      2010. The President's 2000 budget would extend that lifetime ten years further, to 2020.
       The commitment of the surplus will help a bipartisan effort - including the current
      Medicare Commission -        go even farther. The President wants to consider, as a part of
      this reform process, expanding Medicare coverage to include prescription drugs.

     The President also proposes using 12 percent of the surplus to finance his new Universal
      Savings Accounts - "USAs." He believes that the USA is the right kind of tax cut --
      fiscally responsible, targeted toward for the future, and helping the many American
      families who have the most difficulty saving for their retirement. This proposal includes
      seed money for Federal contributions, plus additional funds for matching contributions
      for individual workers who invest their own funds. The matching contributions will
      provide a larger percentage inducement for low-wage workers.

     The budget proposes that the remaining 11 percent of the surplus be dedicated to other
      important priorities - including education, National security, and health care. The
      President's budget is a sound, disciplined way to provide the resources needed for these
      priorities.

     We must use this opportunity to fix Social Security and then proceed to address
      Medicare, USA accounts, and our pressing investment priorities.

Rise to the Moment:

     The 2000 budget is a model for the new era of surplus. It maintains fiscal discipline,
      strategic investment, and uses the surplus to save Social Security First. As the President
      said in the State of the Union, "With our budget surplus growing, our economy
      expanding, our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our
      historic responsibility to the 21st Century. Let's get to work."

                                        February 1, 1999


Please see summary document "President Clinton's FY 2000 Budget: Meeting the Nation's
Long-Term Challenges" (8 pages) for highlights of the Initiatives. Also see "Talking Points:
The Fundamentals of President Clinton's FY2000 Budget. "


1. You have exceeded the caps by $213 billion over five years. How can you say your budget
respects fiscal discipline?

        The 2000 budget proposes discretionary spending that -- along with cuts in other
discretionary programs, offsets from mandatory programs and resources that are contingent upon
Social Security reform -- meets the caps set by the Balanced Budget Agreements. Every dime of
discretionary spending in this budget is paid for.


2. Do YQu believe the caps should be adjusted?

        We are not proposing raising the caps fro FY 2000. The budget would pay for
discretionary spending within the caps, as mentioned above. The Administration proposes to
raise the caps in 2001-2003, ifthere is agreement on Social Security reform. We believe the caps
have served as a useful constraint on discretionary spending and would support their extension
through 2004.

3. But aren't you spending the surplus?

       The President is adhering to his pledge last year to Save Social Security first. The
President's plan calls for 62% of the surplus over the next 15 years to be dedicated to the Social
Security Trust Fund. He believes the time to act to save Social Security is now.

         Once we have saved Social Security, we would invest 15% of the surplus for the next 15
years in the Medicare Trust Fund. After that we would tum to investing 12% of the surplus in
Universal Savings Accounts, which is a powerful new tax incentive to encourages retirement
savings. 11 % percent of the surplus would be reserved for strategic investments like improving
the military readiness of our Armed Forces and pressing domestic needs like education.

       We will allocate these resources only after we reach a comprehensive bipartisan
consensus on saving Social Security. The allocation of these resources is contingent upon Social
Security reform.

4. If this Administration is being so disciplined, why is spending going up to is highest
level in history in this budget?
                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
        Federal spending under President Clinton has declined according to every meaningful
yardstick:

        Spending in every year for which President Clinton wrote a budget has been a smaller
share of our economy than in any year under the two previous Administrations.

       Spending as a percentage of the economy has declined in every year of this
Administration.

        Last year, 1998, Federal spending as a share of the economy was at its lowest in a
                      quarter of a century.

       The 1999 budget was 19.7 percent ofthe Gross Domestic Product; it drops to 19.4 of the
GDP in the year 2000.

       The actual expenditures in the budget rise because an increasing number of elderly people
go on Social Security and Medicare, because of interest rates on the debt we have inherited and
because the cost of medical care for the low-income population is considerable.

5. Given your surplus forecast of $2.5 trillion during the next 10 years, there are clearly
sufficient resources to provide for a tax cut. Why are you opposed?

        The question that will shape our economic policy, and will be crucial to the prosperity
and strength of the nation in the 21st century is: what should we do with the surplus. We can
continue a policy that balances fiscal discipline with critical investments for the future or we can
squander our hard-earned resources with short-sighted policies.

 The President has outlined a framework to save Social Security, strengthen Medicare, boost
retirement savings and provide for crucial domestic priorities. This plan provides resources to
meet our current obligations to future generations for Social Security and Medicare.

        By contrast, policies to spend the surplus on large tax cuts would do nothing to provide
for the future. A large across-the-board tax cut would spend the surplus now and leave our
existing commitments to Social Security and Medicare for our children and grandchildren to pay
in the future.

         This is not the time to turn from the path of fiscal discipline and strategic investments
that brought us our remarkable economic success. A large across-the-board tax cut would bring
us back to the days of fiscal irresponsibility, and undermine our hard-earned gains.

6. What is the amount of increased taxes in this budget?

        The Administration continues its commitment to reducing tobacco use, especially among
young people. All public health experts agree that raising the cost of cigarettes is an effective
deterrent. The Administration proposal would impose a price increase of 55 cents a pack, and
                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
 would accelerate a 15 cent increase already legislated by Congress. The funds raised by this, a
 total of $8 billion in FY2000, would offset tobacco related health care costs that the Federal
 government already carries.

        Setting apart tobacco, there is no net increase of taxes in this budget. (If asked: The
 increased revenues to the Treasury that have boosted the surplus are the result of a healthy
 economy -- more people working at higher wages --- but are not the result of increased taxes. We
 now have the lowest tax burden in two decades for a typical middle-income family.)

 7. Do you have your own tax cuts in this budget?

         The President's plan to allocate 12 % of the projected surpluses to create new Universal
  Savings Accounts (USA's) so that all working Americans can save for retirement. Elements of
  this powerful new tax incentive could include, for example: Automatic flat annual contributions
. for low and moderate working Americans, and an additional tax incentive to match a portion of
  each dollar on a progressive basis that an individual contributes.

         In addition, the budget provides $34 billion over five years in additional paid-for targeted
 tax relief including:
         a $1,000 long-term care tax credit to pay for long-tenn care services for about 2 million
         Americans;
        a $1,000 tax credit for work-related expenses for people with disabilities;
        tax credits to build modem schools for our children;
        tax relief for child care for 3 million working families, plus tax relief for parents who stay
         home;
        and others to preserve green space and create and restore outdoor sites, spur new equity
         for investment in underserved communities, increase the low-income housing tax credit,
         provide tax credits fro more fuel efficient vehicles and homes, and others.

 The $34 billion over five years in targeted tax cuts are paid for with proposals to curb corporate
 tax shelters and reductions in unwarranted tax subsidies.

 8. What about spending cuts. How much and what are they?

        This Administration is committed to a government that does more with less. In six years,
 through consolidation and efficient management we have been able to eliminate the equivalent of
 365,000 full time employees. In addition, we have also cut programs and spending when and
 where appropriate, and when it meets our overall goals.

          For example, the Year 2000 budget has provided additional resources at the Federal
 level for the 21 st Century Policing Initiative, also known as Cops II. This will continue to put
 more officers on the street, while improving the equipment and technology they rely on and
 devoting more resources to community efforts for prosecution of criminals. For this reason, we
 made cuts in local law enforcement block grants. The end result will be a well-coordinated,
 well-funded anti-crime program.
                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
        Other examples are the EPA and the NASA. In the case of there is an general budget
reductions, but priority programs within their budgets have been increased. Overall spending for
NASA has decreased by 1 percent. However, there is an increase of2.46 billion -- an increase of
8 percent for the Space Station --- because this joint project between the United States and Russia
marks the start of an era of international cooperation in space.

         In addition, there are cuts in the EPA to address the fact that certain programs have
fulfilled their objectives, while other areas have had support increased. For example, funding for
the Clean Water State Revolving Funds in FY2000 has been cut by $550 million because the
funds are approaching their goals for full capitalization, meaning that they are reaching the level
originally targeted that will enable them to make loans through States to local governments.
At the same time, key programs within EPA have had their support increased. There is a 5%
increase -- nearly $200 million for 2000 -- in the core operating program, which includes
regulatory functions, including public environmental and public health issues, and clear air
regulations. In addition, Climate Change Technology will see its funding nearly double for the
Year 2000.


9. What about the mandatory offsets you referred to earlier? How much does that raise?

       Offsets from mandatory programs total $17.7. billion dollars, $8 billion of which comes
from our public health initiative to raise the cost of cigarettes by 55 cents (discussed elsewhere.)
There are also savings from Medicare, both in fraud and abuse and from management reforms at
the Health Care Financing Administration, and from the FAA user fee, among other items.

10. The Presidents 2000 budget assumes that $8 billion will be received in additional
tobacco revenues by raising the price of cigarettes to 55 cents a pack. What programs in
your budget will be funded with these funds?

        The President is committed to reducing smoking in this country, especially among young
people. Raising the price of cigarettes is an effective deterrent, and one that we are pursuing
again this year in our drive against tobacco.

        Tobacco related problems cost the Federal government billions of dollars each year. In
the case of tobacco, the Administration is seeking reimbursement to the taxpayer for costs that
are directly related to tobacco companies.

        Apart from Medicare, we have calculated that there are a total of $8 billion in tobacco
related health care costs in FY 2000 in Veterans Affairs, the Federal Health plan, the Defense
Department and Indian Health Service. The funding for these programs is not contingent upon
tobacco receipts.

11. What about the Federal government's plans to recoup some ofthe State settlements
with the tobacco companies?
                                   Hex-Dwnp Conversion
        The Administration plans to pursue recoupment of the Federal share of all state
third-party liability collections, including the recent state tobacco settlements. Since U.S.
taxpayers paid a substantial portion of the Medicaid costs that were the primary basis for the state
settlements, the budget assumes the Federal government will follow the law and claim its share
of the proceeds. However, the Administration again proposes to work with the States and the
Congress to enact tobacco legislation that, among other things, resolves these Federal claims in
exchange for a commitment by the States to use the Federal share to support programs that are
currently shared state and national priorities.

      The recoupment is not reflected in the budget until 2001, allowing a year for the
Administration to work with Congress and the States on a recoupment policy.

12. Is this budget <lead on arrival?

         The President has already set the terms of debate, with his proposal to save Social
Security First by dedicating 62% of the surplus to Social Security for the next fifteen years, and
then to allocate the surplus to Medicare, to boost retirement savings, and to critical domestic
priorities. The President believes that we should stick to the path of fiscal discipline and invest in
the future -- an approach we have taken for six years and which has brought us this great
economic prosperity. Those are the terms of debate.

The President is committed to working with Congress to pass the initiatives in this budget.
You'll notice that last year, there were predictions that the President was not going to get
anything out of Congress, and by the time the legislative session closed we had done pretty well,
with victories on class size, other educational spending, environmental issues, LIHEAP.

        We have every intention of working seriously with Congress this year on initiatives that
matter to our nation's future, starting with Social Security reform.




                             QUESTIONS ON SOCIAL SECURITY

   Q:      Aren't you double-obligating or double-counting the same money?

   A:

           Since 1983, the Social Security trust fund has experienced a growing excess
           of annual receipts over expenditures. This excess is used each year to
           purchase special Treasury securities. The resulting buildup in the trust
           fund is the intended result of the 1983 reforms, which set out to build up a
           large reserve before the baby boom retires.
                          Hex-Dump Conversion
     At the same time, the difference between Social Security receipts and
     expenditures represents an extra inflow of cash each year, which contributes
     to the unified budget surplus.

     The critical problem during the 1980s and the early 1990s was that
     Government simply spent those funds on current needs. This did nothing to
     ensure that we could payoff those securities in the future without huge
     spending cuts, tax increases, or borrowing more money.

     Hard-won fiscal discipline during the past 6 years means that the
     government can pay back bonds in the trust fund and still run surpluses.

     The question now is whether to use the current unified budget surplus to
     finance our existing commitment to pay future Social Security and Medicare
     benefits further into the future. The President's plan would channel almost
     $3 trillion into debt reduction, and would lock in some of the gains from this
     fiscal discipline to pay Social Security benefits until 2055 and Medicare
     benefits until 2020.


Q:   How will the government meet its new obligations to Social Security and
     Medicare?

A:

     The President's plan does not create new obligations of the government. We
     begin with the obligation to pay Social Security benefits beyond 2032 and
     Medicare benefits beyond 2008. The President's plan just sets aside the
     resources to make that possible.

     The President's plan would generate a dramatic decline in the national debt.
     By 2006, the debt-to-GDP ratio would be below its level in 1980; by 2014, it
     would be about 7%, below its level when the U.S. entered World War I in
     1917; by 2017, it would be below O. In absolute nominal terms, the debt held
     by the public in 2014 would be only 30 percent of its current value.

     By buying back such a large amount of debt, the government would
     substantially boost national saving and national wealth. Compared to a
     policy of spending the surpluses, government saving would average about
     2% more of GDP from 2000 through 2014. The USA accounts would boost
     saving even more. In 1992 net national saving was 3.1 % of GDP; in the first
     three quarters of 1998, it was 6.7%, a doubling that was more than
     accounted for by the increase in Federal government saving. Thus, a 2% of
     GDP difference is quite substantial, and if sustained for 15 years would
     produce a large increase in national wealth.
                             Hex-Dump Conversion

     If the unified budget surpluses were not dedicated to Social Security and
     Medicare, it would be very difficult to sustain them for 15 years. Thus, the
     economic benefits of debt reduction are closely linked to the President's
     decision to commit some of these benefits to Social Security and Medicare.

     Even if one focuses on the non-Social Security part of the budget, and ignores
     the unfunded liability of the Social Security trust fund, the President's plan
     is very fiscally responsible. The extra debt held by the trust fund raises the
     debt service costs of the on-budget government, but reduced debt service to.
     the public offsets 3/4 of that cost in 2014. (It does not offset all of the cost
     because debt held by the public does not decline as rapidly as debt held by
     the trust fund increases. This differential is an artifact of the way that
     intergovernmental interest payments are scored.) The increase in national
     wealt~ would also increase national income and therefore tax revenue.
     Crude estimates suggest that this could offset another 15% of the increased
     interest payments to the trust funds in 2014.

     Under the President's plan, we project on-budget surpluses for decades to
     come.


Q:   Won't the government have to cut spending, raise taxes or borrow more in
     the future to pay for the extension of Social Security benefits to 2055 and
     Medicare benefits to 2020?

A:

     No. Our projections show that if we simply maintain current tax rules, we
     will be running surpluses until the middle of the next century even after
     paying Social Security and Medicare benefits.

     By setting aside funds now, the President's plan produces the resources to
     pay Social Security and Medicare benefits in the future. It does this in four
     ways:

             First, by investing some the surplus in equities, the plan builds up real
     assets that can be sold when the time comes to pay benefits.
             Second, by reducing the ratio of publicly-held debt to GDP from 44
             percent to 7 percent, the plan reduces debt servicing costs --leaving
             more resources available for other purposes, including paying Social
             Security and Medicare benefits.

            Third, by paying down debt, we increase capital formation. The
     resulting increase in the capital stock raises workers' productivity and
                            Hex-Dump Conversion
     national income. These additional real resources will increase the future
     standard of living, and make it easier for society to pay Social Security and
     Medicare benefits in the future.

            Fourth, by nearly eliminating the national debt by 2014, the plan
            leaves us in a position to do a limited amount of additional borrowing,
            if necessary, without threatening economic prosperity.


Q:   How does paying down the debt help us to pay Social Security benefits in the
     future?

A:

     First, a little history. The 1983 Social Security reform act aimed to prepare
     the nation to meet its future commitment to Social Security recipients by
     having the system collect more revenue than it paid in benefits for a couple of
     decades. These extra funds were supposed to be used to put the country on
     a fiscal trajectory to be able to pay back the Social Security trust fund when
     the trust fund needed to redeem its bonds.

     Unfortunately, irresponsible fiscal policy in the 1980s and early 1990s
     produced large unified budget deficits, (these included the Social Security
     surpluses.) By the time President Clinton took office in 1993, large deficits
     were forecast as far as the eye could see, and there were serious doubts about
     how the country would be able to pay back what it owed to Social Security,.

     Six years of tough choices and fiscal discipline have turned things around.
     Because of the 1993 budget act, disciplined appropriations, and the 1997
     budget agreement, we are now projecting large surpluses well into the next
     century, even after paying back every penny we owe to Social Security.

     The President believes we should go even further, buying down around $3
     trillion in debt and allocating these savings to ensure that Social Security is
     secure until 2055 and that Medicare is secure until 2020.

     By setting aside funds now, the President's plan produces the resources to
     pay back Social Security in the future. It does this in four ways:
     [SUMMARIZED ABOVE)



Q:   Why not just pay down the debt without incurring extra obligations?

A:
                              Hex-Dump Conversion
     The President's plan does not create new obligations ofthe government. We
     always expected to pay Social Security benefits beyond 2032 and Medicare
     benefits beyond 2008. The President's plan just sets aside the resources to
     make that possible.

     Some people would simply take Social Security out of the budget and pay
     down $2.7 trillion of debt without extending the life of the Social Security or
     Medicare trust funds by a single year. Then they would debate only how
     much of the remaining surplus would go to tax cuts, military and other
     spending, and individual accounts.

     If this approach truly managed to keep the Social Security surpluses from
     being spent, and thereby left them for debt reduction, then this approach
     would put the country in a better fiscal situation, just as the President's plan
     does. However, this approach would leave open the allocation of the large
     future surpluses for various forms of spending and large tax cuts.

     We believe that we should take advantage of today's prosperity to prepare
     for the aging of America, and therefore "that we should lock in much of the
     benefits of an improved fiscal outlook for Social Security and Medicare.


Q:   You said that debt held by the public falls under the President's plan, but
     since the government is giving additional bonds to the trust funds, doesn't the
     government's total indebtedness stay the same?

A:

     No, that is not the right way to think about the economic impact of the
     President's plan.

     Debt held by the public is the most important measure of government
     indebtedness because it tells us the extent to which government borrowing
     crowds out private capital formation. Under the President's plan, the ratio
     of debt held by the public to GDP will fall from 44 percent today to 7 percent
     in 2014 --the lowest level since 1917. This will unleash a tremendous amount
     of new private sector investment and will make the government much more
     able to meet our commitment to Social Security and Medicare recipients in
     the future.

     The President's plan essentially gives Social Security and Medicare a "first
     call" on the gains from reducing debt. We think it makes perfect sense to
     allocate part of the gains from our fiscally responsible policies to extending
     the lives of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
                           Hex-Dwnp Conversion
     In any event, a more comprehensive measure of the government's future
     obligations would include promised Social Security and Medicare benefits.
     The excess of those benefits over expected revenues is an unfunded liability
     comparable in some respects to the explicit national debt.

     The President's plan does not increase promised benefits by one dollar.
     Instead, it finances the existing commitment to pay benefits by paying down
     publicly-held debt and directing some of the benefits if that debt reduction to
     the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.


Q:   A column in last week's Newsweek argues that the President's budget
     allocates 150 percent of the budget surplus. Is that true?

A:

     No, it is not. The President's plan allocates 100 percent ofthe unified
     budget surplus. In focusing on the unified budget surplus, we are doing
     exactly what every President since Lyndon Johnson has done in formulating
     budget policy.

     The fundamental budget policy choice we are facing is how to allocate $4.5
     trillion in surpluses over the next 15 years among debt reduction, new
     spending, and tax cuts. The President's plan allocates the bulk of these
     surpluses to debt reduction, and gives Social Security and Medicare claims
     on the wealth created by our current fiscal discipline.

     Under the Newsweek type of accounting, every budget in the last 30 years
     would be guilty of "double counting" or spending more than 100 percent of
     the surplus. The crucial difference is that during the 1980s and early 1990s,
     the extra inflows from Social Security were spent on current needs. Under
     the President's plan, they would be dedicated to debt reduction, which would
     strengthen our economy for the future.


Q:   Isn't this plan based entirely on double counting of money that is already
     dedicated to Social Security?

A:

     This is not the right way to think about the economic impact of the
     President's plan.

     Currently, the government as a whole is running a surplus --it is bringing in
     more in revenue than it is paying out. The fundamental question for our
                           Hex-Dwnp Conversion

     budget policy is what to do with the excess.


     The President is proposing that most of the excess be set aside to pay for
     future retirement and health needs stemming from the aging of America.
     This will add to national savings and improve the country's wealth --in
     contrast to the effect of plans that propose to use the surplus for tax cuts or
     immediate spending needs.

     The President's plan allocates the unified budget surplus to different uses,
     just as every budget has done for the last 30 years. The funds the President
     is setting aside for Social Security and ~edicare are real and would
     presumably go to tax cuts or new spending if they were not set aside for debt
     reduction. This is the first time a President has called for some of the
     surplus to be set aside for debt reduction.

     We believe that it is sensible to allocate some of the benefits of fiscal
     responsibility to Social Security and Medicare. In addition, by allocating
     the gains from debt reduction to Social Security and Medicare it locks away
     the surpluses and prevents them from being squandered on tax cuts or new
     spending.


Q:   What will happen when the trust funds redeem assets to pay benefits?

A:

     When Social Security revenue from the payroll tax and the taxation of
     benefits falls short of what is needed to pay benefits (around 2013), the Social
     Security trust fund will start redeeming assets.

     Some of these assets will be stocks that it can simply sell without having to
     find other financing.

     The rest of the assets will be government bonds. Redeeming these bonds
     means that Social Security gets money to pay benefits from the general fund
     of the government. Thus the government must come up with the cash for
     Social Security.

                    If the government is running a unified budget surplus at the
            time, it can simply use the surplus to payoff the bonds. This will
            reduce the surpluses available to pay for other things. Under our
            current projections, we will be running surpluses even after paying
            back Social Security well into the next century.
                Hex-Dump Conversion
       Ot~erwise,  the government has three standard choices for how
to obtain the cash for Social Security --it can issue debt, raise taxes, or
reduce other spending.

The ratio of debt held by the public to GDP is projected to be close to
zero at the time when we start paying back Social Security. Thus we
could issue debt to pay back Social Security and still keep
debt-to-GDP ratios below those that we have today.

       Moreover, after we make the tough, bipartisan choices to
extend the system for 75 years we will likely have closed the gap
between taxes and spending in the period before 2055.
