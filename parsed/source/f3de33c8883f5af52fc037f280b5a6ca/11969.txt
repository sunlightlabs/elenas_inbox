      To assist institutions of higher education help at-risk students stay in school and
complete their 4-year postsecondary academic programs.

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled, this Act may be cited as the "College Completion
Challenge Grant Program of 1999


                                 PROGRAM AUTHORIZED


        SEC. 101. Subpart 2, Chapter A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965

(20 U.S.C. 1132a et seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new

chapter:

PROGRAM


                                         "FINDINGS


        "SEC. 408A.     Congress makes the following findings:

               "(1) Students from low-income families are significantly more likely to

leave a 4-year institution of higher education without a baccalaureate degree than are

students with higher incomes.

               "(2) Even among students with above average grades, low-income

students are still more likely to leave a 4-year institution of higher education without a

baccalaureate degree than are students with higher incomes, especially low-income

students enrolled at private institutions.

               "(3) This lack of persistence to completion of a baccalaureate degree

continues to contribute to the gap in educational attainment and ultimate income levels

between disadvantaged students and their more affluent classmates.

               "(4) While the focus of Federal student financial assistance and higher

education programs has traditionally been to ensure access to postsecondary

education, the Federal Government should expand its role in student financial

assistance programs for postsecondary education to address this lack of persistence to

baccalaureate degree completion.

                "(5) The amount of grant assistance provided to postsecondary students

is critical to their persistence and degree attainment.

                "(6) In addition to economic disadvantage, the following factors

significantly contribute to a student dropping out of a 4-year institution of higher

education:

                       "(A) a delayed entry into postsecondary education after

graduating from high school.

                       "(B) a low grade point average.

                       "(C) working full-time while enrolled.

                       "(D) being a first-generation college student.

                       "(E) being less engaged with an academic program.



                       "PURPOSE AND PROGRAM AUTHORITY

        "SEC. 408B.    (a) PURPOSE. ?The purpose of this program is to assist

institutions of higher education to help students who are at risk of ending their

postsecondary education prior to obtaining baccalaureate degrees, particularly those

who are economically disadvantaged, to stay in school until they complete those

degrees.

       "(b) PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.? From funds appropriated pursuant to section

408G for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall, in accordance with the requirements of

this chapter, award competitive grants to eligible institutions to enable them to pay the

Federal share of the costs of carrying out programs designed to meet the purpose of

this chapter.

        "(c) COORDINATION REQUIREMENT. ?Each eligible institution shall ensure

that the activities provided under this chapter are, to the extent practicable, coordinated

grant award levels under paragraph (1), or if an institution wishes to provide grants

under subsection (a)(3) in an amount less than the minimum set by the Secretary, the

institution shall demonstrate in its application, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that

                  THE COLLEGE COMPLETION ACT OF1999
                        Section-by-Section Analysis

         Section 101. Section 101 of the bill would amend subpart 2, Part A of
title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1132a et seq., hereinafter
referred to as the Act) by adding a new chapter 4, authorizing the College
Completion Challenge Grant Program.

        Proposed new section 408A of the Act would set out the Congressional
findings for the new chapter. Students from low-income families are significantly
more likely to leave a 4-year institution of higher education without a
baccalaureate degree than are students with higher incomes. Specifically, the
baccalaureate degree attainment rate for full-time students from families from
the bottom income quartile was 23 percentage points less than the rate for
fUll-time students from families from the top income quartile (44.5% vs. 68.4%).

        Even among students with above average grades, low-income students
are still more likely to leave a 4-year institution of higher education without a
baccalaureate degree than are students with higher incomes, especially at
private institutions. Contributing to the gap in educational attainment between
disadvantaged students and their more affluent classmates is the fact that the
focus of Federal student financial assistance and higher education programs has
traditionally been to ensure access to postsecondary education, and not on the
lack of persistence to a baccalaureate degree. The amount of grant assistance
provided to postsecondary students is also critical to their persistence and
degree attainment. Through this bill, the Federal Government would expand its
role in student financial assistance programs for postsecondary education to
address this lack of persistence to baccalaureate degree completion.

        In addition to economic disadvantage, a number of other factors
contribute significantly to a student dropping out of a 4-year institution of higher
education. Those factors include: a delayed entry into postsecondary education
after graduating from high school; a low grade point average; working full-time
while enrolled; being a first-generation college student; and being less engaged
with an academic program. Grants to institutions under this program would
assist these institutions in providing services that could mitigate the effects of
these factors on a student's likelihood of dropping out of a 4-year institution of
higher education.

      Proposed new section 4088 of the Act would establish the program's
statement of purpose and program authority. Under proposed new section
4088(a), the purpose of this chapter would be to assist institutions of higher
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

education to help students who are at risk of ending their postsecondary
education prior to obtaining a baccalaureate degree, particularly those who are
economically disadvantaged, to stay in school until they complete their
baccalaureate degrees. Proposed new section 40B8(b) would authorize the
Secretary, from funds appropriated for each fiscal year and in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter, to award competitive grants to eligible
institutions to enable them to pay the Federal share of the costs of carrying out
programs designed to meet the purpose stated in proposed new section
40B8(a).

         Proposed new section 40BC of the Act would establish the institutional
eligibility requirements for receiving a grant under this chapter. Section 40BC(a)
would provide that eligible applicants for grants under this chapter would be
institutions of higher education that meet the requirements of section 102 of the
Act, the definition of an institution of higher education used for purposes of title
IV, and that award baccalaureate or associate degrees. An institution that
awards only associate degrees, however, could apply for a grant under this
chapter only if it applied as part of a consortium that included one or more
institutions of higher education that awarded baccalaureate degrees.
Proposed new section 40SC would also establish the requirement that an
institution that receives a grant under this chapter may receive no more than two
such grants.

       Proposed new section 40S0 of the Act would establish the application
process requirements. Proposed new section 40S0(a) would provide that an
applicant that desires a grant under this chapter must submit to the Secretary an
application at such time and containing such information as the Secretary may
prescribe. Proposed new section 40S0 would also require that an applicant
demonstrate in its application, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, its prior
successful commitment to assisting institutions of higher education to help
students who are at risk of ending their postsecondary education prior to
obtaining a baccalaureate degree stay in school until they complete those
degrees. Institutions are primarily responsible for ensuring the success of their
students. The new program is therefore intended to assist institutions that have
made efforts to increase the retention of students.

        Proposed new section 40S0(b) would describe the matching requirement
for institutions that receive a grant under this chapter. Proposed new section
40S0(b )(1) provides that the Federal share of the cost of the program must be
not more than 50%, and the matching funds must be from non-Federal sources.
However, the Secretary intends to use his authority under section 395 of the Act
to waive this matching requirement for institutions eligible for assistance under
Part A or 8 of title III, and under section 515 of the Act to waive the matching
requirement for institutions eligible for assistance under title V. The Secretary
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

also intends to regulate on the matching requirement as it would apply to a
consortium of institutions in which only some of the institutions would be eligible
for the waiver of the matching requirement.

       Proposed new section 40BD(c) of the Act would require institutions
applying for a grant to ensure that the activities it would provide if it received a
grant under this chapter would be coordinated with, complement, and enhance
related services under other programs, and would not duplicate services already
provided at that institution. . Proposed new section 40BD(d) of the Act would
provide that funds under this chapter would have to be used to supplement, and
not supplant, non-Federal funds expended for existing programs.

         Proposed new section 40BE of the Act details the authorized uses of
funds received under this chapter. Proposed new section 40BE(a) would
establish the three types of activities for which institutions could use funds
received under this chapter: intensive summer programs, student support
services, and grants for students. While summer intensive programs have been
shown to be effective in increasing student persistence, they are only effective
when the institution is committed to student retention. Therefore, institutions
could implement an intensive summer program for incoming first-year students,
students entering their second year of postsecondary education, and students
entering their third year of postsecondary education, but could do so only if they
could demonstrate a strong commitment to student retention through other
activities.

       Under proposed new section 40BE(a)(2), an institution could also use
funds under this chapter to develop a strong student support service program,
targeted to students in their first two years of postsecondary education. This
could include activities such as peer tutoring; mentoring by faculty or upper class
students; activities to assist students currently enrolled in a 2-year institution
secure admission and financial assistance in a 4-year program of postsecondary
education; activities to assist students in securing admission and financial
assistance for enrollment in graduate and professional programs; course
selection assistance; and cultural events.

        Finally, proposed new section 40BE(a)(3) would provide that institutions
could use funds received under this chapter to provide grants to students in their
first two years of postsecondary education, but only if it also provided an
intensive summer program for incoming first-year students, or developed a
student support service program, targeted to students in their first two years of
postsecondary education, or both. The goal of the program is not simply to
create another Federal grant program. The grant aid provided under the new
program would be in the context of specific efforts to increase student success.
                                                                         Hex.gump Conversion

         Although this program would require institutions to target services to
students in their first two years of postsecondary education, proposed new
section 40BE(b) would allow an institution to serve students who have completed
their first two years if it could demonstrate in its application, to the satisfaction of
the Secretary, that those students are at risk of failing to make the transition from
a 2-year program of instruction to a baccalaureate degree program. While most
students leave during the first two years of college, some do leave during the
subsequent years. Since this is especially true for institutions that enroll large
numbers of students that transfer from a community college, the program would
allow those students to be served in subsequent years.

       Proposed new section 40BE(c)(1) of the Act would provide the Secretary
with the authority to set, by regulation, a minimum student grant award level for
those institutions that provide grants to students. In setting a minimum student
grant award level, the Secretary would take into account such factors as the
different costs of attendance associated with public and private institutions. If
the Secretary did not establish a minimum student grant award, or if an institution
wanted to provide a grants below the minimum set by the Secretary, proposed
new section 40BD(c)(2) would require the institution to demonstrate in its
application, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the size of the grants it
would provide were appropriate and likely to have a significant effect on the
persistence problem at that institution.

         Proposed new section 40BF of the Act would describe how a grant to a
student would affect the calculation of that student's need for other title IV
assistance. Under proposed new section 40BF, a grant provided to a student by
an eligible institution from an award made under this chapter would not be
considered in determining that student's need for grant, or work assistance under
title IV of the Act. However, the total amount of financial assistance awarded to
a student under title IV, including a grant provided under this chapter, could not
exceed that student's cost of attendance, as defined by section 472 of the Act.

       Proposed new section 40BG(a) of the Act would authorize the
appropriation of $35,000,000 to carry out this program for fiscal year 2000, and
such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.
Proposed new section 40BG(b) of the Act would authorize the Secretary to
reserve up to 1% of the appropriation for that fiscal year in order to carry out an
evaluation of the program authorized by this chapter.

      Section 102. Section 102 of the bill would state that this bill is effective
on October 1, 1999.

Dear Mr. Speaker:

I am pleased to submit for your consideration the "College Completion Challenge Grant
Act of 1999", a legislative proposal that would assist institutions of higher education to
expand their efforts to increase the rate at which low-income and other at-risk students
complete baccalaureate degree programs.

Students from low-income families are significantly more likely to leave a 4-year
institution of higher education without a baccalaureate degree than are students from
families with higher incomes. Only 45 percent of students from low-income families who
were enrolled full-time during their first year of college complete a baccalaureate degree
within five years. This completion rate is 23 percentage points lower than the 68.4
percent completion rate among students from upper-income families.

In addition to economic disadvantage, a recent report by the National Center for
Education Statistics, Stopouts or Stayouts? Undergraduates Who Leave College in Their
First Year, concludes that there are a number of factors significantly associated with
students dropping out of a four-year college or university. These factors include having a
low- to failing- cumulative GP A (under 2.0); delaying entry into postsecondary education
after graduating from high school; being less engaged with their academic program;
working full time while enrolled; and being a first-generation college student. This
legislative proposal would allow institutions of higher education to help mitigate those
factors most significantly associated with the failure to complete baccalaureate degree
programs.

  Specifically, there are three different forms of services or assistance that an institution
  could provide under the proposed new College Completion Challenge Grant Program.
  An institution could implement an intensive summer program, develop strong student
. support services, provide direct grant aid to students, or a combination of these activities.
    Intensive summer programs could be provided only if the institution demonstrates in its
  application that it has a strong commitment to student retention through additional
  activities. Support services under the proposed new program could include peer tutoring,
  mentor programs, activities to assist students currently enrolled in a 2-year institution to
  secure admission and financial assistance in a 4-year program of postsecondary
  education, activities to assist students in securing admission and financial assistance for
  graduate and professional programs, assistance in course selection, and cultural events.
  If an institution chose to provide grants to students under the proposed new College
  Completion Challenge Grant Program, it would be required to do so in combination with
  at least one of the other two authorized activities and those grants would have to meet
 certain minimum amounts and would supplement other Federal grant assistance, such as
  Federal Pell Grants.


While each institution would determine which combination of services and assistance to

                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
    offer for its at risk students, the particular services and assistance that would be available
    under this proposal are designed to address the factors most significantly associated with
    the failure to complete baccalaureate degree programs. Support services and intensive
    summer programs would help to address the factors of the low GP A, less engagement
    with the academic program and first-generation college student status. Intensive summer
    programs offered for students entering their first year of postsecondary education would
    also help prevent students from delaying their entry into college. Finally, a substantial
    increase in grant aid would reduce some students' need to work full time while enrolled,
    and address some of the concerns of a first generation college student regarding student
    loan debt burden and the availability of adequate financial aid.

    Since low-income and at-risk students are most likely to leave a program of
    postsecondary education during the first two years, an institution would be required to
    focus services and assistance on students in their first two years of postsecondary
    education. Another critical point for at risk students is the transition from a 2-year
    program of instruction to a baccalaureate degree program, and institutions could also
    provide services under the proposed new College Completion Challenge Grant Program
    to students at risk of failing to make that transition.

    This legislative proposal would help to eliminate the discrepancy that currently exists in
    baccalaureate degree attainment rates for students of low- and high-income families by
    supporting the specific activities that research has shown to improve student retention for
    students at-risk of leaving a 4-year institution without a baccalaureate degree. It would
    build on the successes ofthe TRIO and student financial assistance programs by
    combining selected elements of each and narrowly focusing that combination of services
    and assistance on students in the early years of postsecondary education. It would also
    build on the successes of the participating institutions, requiring institutions to
    demonstrate a prior successful commitment to helping low-income and other at-risk
    students stay in school until they complete their baccalaureate degrees. I urge the
    speedy enactment of the "College Completion Challenge Grant Act of 1999" by
    Congress. It would help to ensure that all Americans not only have access to
    postsecondary education, but also the support necessary to ensure that they complete that
    education and receive their degrees.

    The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the
    submission of this proposal to the Congress and that its adoption would be in accord with
    the program of the President.
                                                 Yours sincerely,



                                                  Richard W. Riley
