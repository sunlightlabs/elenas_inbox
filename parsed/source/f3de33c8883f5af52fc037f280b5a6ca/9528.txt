    H.R. 4274 -- DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,
      EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
                  (Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana; Porter (R), Illinois)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.R.
4274, the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations
Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.

       Due to the very serious funding and language issues present in the Committee bill,
discussed below, the President would veto the bill in its current form.

         The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level for programs funded by this bill
is to offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas. The President's FY 1999
Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan
Budget Agreement by making savings through user fees and certain mandatory programs to help
firiance this spending. In the Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis
-- took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation programs paid for with
mandatory offsets. In addition, this year, as in the past, such mandatory offsets have been
approved by the House and the Senate in other appropriations bills. We want to work with the
Congress on mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be used to increase
funding for high-priority discretionary programs, including those funded by this bill. In
addition, we hope that the House will reduce funding for lower priority discretionary programs
and redirect funding to programs of higher priority.

Department of Education

       The Committee bill cuts $2 billion from the President's overall request for education
program funding. As aresult, the bill does not adequately support the Nation's efforts to raise
student achievement, make schools safe, and improve the capabilities of teachers. High priority
programs inadequately funded include (listed in bill order):

      Goals 2000. Funding for Goals 2000 is cut $255 million below the President's request,
       which would reverse momentum in all 50 States to raise academic standards and deny
       6,000 schools serving over three million students the funds needed to implement
       innovative education reforms.

      School-to-Work. School-to-Work is cut by a total of$100 million (between the
                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
    would seriously hamper all States' efforts to help young people of all backgrounds move
    from high school to careers or postsecondary training and education,

   Technology in Education. The Committee's $137 million reduction from the request
    would make it increasingly difficult for States to meet school children's education
    technology needs, especially in training teachers to integrate educational technology into
    their curriculum effectively.

   Title I (Education for the Disadvantaged) Grants to Local Educational Agencies. The
    Committee bill cuts $392 million from the request, which would leave nearly 520,000
    students in high-poverty communities without the extra help they need to master the
    basics and develop the capability to reach high academic standards.

   Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities. The Committee's $50 million reduction
    would deny funding for School Coordinators in nearly one-half of the Nation's middle
    schools needed to implement effective drug and violence prevention programs.

   Education Opportunity Zones. The Committee bill does not provide the requested $200
    million, which would deny high-poverty urban and rural districts the extra assistance they
    need to implement effective reforms with tough accountability for performance.

   America Reads. America Reads is denied the $210 million provided in last year's
    Bipartisan Budget Agreement for children's literacy and denied the additional S50 million
    the President requested. These funds would prevent thousands of young children from
    receiving the extra help they need to learn to read well and independently by the end of
    the third grade.

   Bilingual Education. The Committee has cut by $25 million the President's plan for
    training teachers to help limited-English proficient children.

   Work-Study. Roughly 57,000 needy students would be denied the opportunity to work
    to finance their college education because of the Committee's $50 million reduction.

   Higher Education Initiatives. No funds are provided for three Presidential initiatives for
    which the President has requested $237 million:

          High Hopes to help prepare students at high poverty middle schools for college.

          Learning Anytime Anywhere Partnership grants for pilot projects using distance
           learning technology.

          New teacher recruitment and preparation programs.
   Eisenhower Professional Development. The Committee's $50 million reduction would
    leave over 100,000 teachers without the training they need to help them teach to rigorous

                                             2           Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

      After School programs (21st Century Community Learning Centers). A $140 million cut
       from the President's request to this program, part of the President's child care initiative,
       would result in 3,000 fewer centers and no services to nearly 400,000 children.

      Hispanic Initiative. In the FY 1999 budget, the President proposed funding increases of
       $212 million for a series of programs to enhance the educational achievement of Hispanic
       Americans. The bill reduces the request by over $90 million, with significant decreases
       from the request in Adult Education, Bilingual Education, Hispanic Serving Institutions,
       and Comprehensive School Reform Demonstrations. Funding for these programs should
       be restored to the level of the President's request.

      Civil Rights Enforcement. Ensuring that civil rights laws and regulations are adequately
       enforced is a fundamental responsibility of government. The Committee fails to provide
       the increase of$6.5 million (for a total of$68 million) requested by the Office for Civil
       Rights in the Education Department and reduced by $2.4 million the request for $67.8
       million for the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance. Both
       activities should be restored to the full requests.

       In addition to inadequate funding for priority education programs, the Administration is
concerned with several language provisions of the Committee bill that would severely restrict the
Administration's ability to continue the development of programs designed to raise academic
standards.

      National Tests. The Administration strongly objects to the language limitation and $15
       million funding cut that would bring a halt to the President's efforts to help States and
       parents raise academic standards through a voluntary national test. The Committee bill's
       language would prohibit the development, implementation, and administration of the tests
       unless explicitly authorized. The language prohibition should be deleted and the funding
       restored.

      Unfocused Block Grants. The Administration strongly objects to language that would, in
       effect, tum the Goals 2000 and the Eisenhower Professional Development programs into
       block grants by allowing those funds to be used under the broad Title VI block grant
       authority. Title VI has no performance or accountability standards. The language
       should be deleted so that these Federal funds can address national needs and continue to
       be guided by strong accountability measures.

      Special Education (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act -- IDEA). The bill
       contains two objectionable IDEA riders. One would undermine the due process
       protections and parental rights for disabled students who are regarded as violent. The
       other would, in effect, allow States to discontinue special education services for youth
       ages 18 to 21 in adult prisons, violating the principle that all disabled youth ages three to
       21 have a right to a free, appropriate public education and undermining the Department of

                                                3
                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
       provisions would unnecessarily re-open IDEA before last year's bipartisan reauthorization
       has had a chance to be implemented and fairly assessed. Both provisions should be
       stricken.

      Bilingual Education. While we agree with the Committee on the need for some reforms
       to Bilingual Education, we are opposed to any provision that would set an absolute limit
       on student participation in bilingual education or alternative programs. Such a step
       would deny help to students who need it and violate the civil rights of Limited English
       Proficient students to an equal education. Because of individual di fferences. students
       will vary in how long it takes to develop English proficiency. We are also opposed to
       provisions that would establish a two-year goal for becoming proficient in English, since
       research has shown that this timetable is unrealistically short.

      Internet Access in Schools and Libraries. The bill contains objectionable language
       that would deny Federal funds to schools and libraries that have not installed
       software on their computers to block Internet access to indecent materials to
       minors. While the Administration strongly supports efforts to ensure that schools
       and libraries protect minors from indecent materials, it objects to such overly
       prescriptive language. Many local education agencies have already developed
       their own acceptable-use policies that are not based on software. Instead, the
       Administration favors less burdensome and restrictive language that would require
       that schools and libraries develop their own acceptable-use plans at the local level
       and certify their implementation.

Department of Labor

        The Administration has strong concerns with the inadequate funding levels provided for
the following Labor programs (listed in bill order):

      Adult Job Training. The Committee has provided none ofthe requested increases for the
       Dislocated Worker ($100 million) and low-income adult ($45 million) job training
       programs. Freezing these programs would mean that some 67,000 fewer workers in need
       of assistance would be helped. Without the requested increases, early implementation of
       the Workforce Investment Act could be jeopardized.

      Summer Jobs Program. The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's
       elimination of the Summer Jobs program. The President's request of$871 million for
       this program could finance up to 530,000 summer jobs for economically disadvantaged
       youth. The unemployment rate for teens continues to far exceed the overall
       unemployment rate. The Summer Jobs program plays a vital role in supporting
       employment among these teens, especially among African-American
       youths -- approximately 25 percent of summer jobs held by African-American 14-15 year
       olds come through this program -- and serves as a valuable introduction to the world of
       work. We urge the House to restore the full request for this program.

                                               4          Automated Records Management System
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
       the President's Youth Opportunity Areas initiative and rescinds the $250 million
       appropriated last year for this program. This program would address the problem of
       pervasive joblessness in high-poverty neighborhoods by making large investments in
       these areas to effect community-wide change and help 50,000 out-of-school youth. We
       oppose elimination of this program, which is an essential component of the
       Administration's Empowennent Zones/Enterprise Communities initiative. We strongly
       urge the House to fully fund this initiative that was recently enacted with strong bipartisan
       support as past ofthe Workforce Investment Act.

      Unemployment Insurance. The House Committee mark does not fund the $91 million
       requested for the Unemployment Insurance (UI) integrity initiative. This initiative was
       authorized in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and would, over the next five years,
       achieve $758 million in mandatory savings. Failure to fund this initiative would mean a
       continuation of errors in benefit payments and UI taxes. A similar initiative in the Social
       Security Administration's Disability Insurance program has proven to be a cost effective
       approach to achieving program savings.

      Worker Protection. The Committee has cut nearly in half the requested increase for
       programs that protect our workers on the job. For example, the Committee mark for the
       Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) redirects resources to Slale
       consultation and is nine-percent below the requested level for Federal enforcement, while
       funding for the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is frozen at the 1998
       level and virtually no funding is provided to the Pension and Welfare Benefits
       Administration (PWBA) for implementing the Health Insurance Portability and
       Accountability Act of 1996. We urge the House'to restore financing for such critical
       workplace protection programs.

      Child Labor. The $5 million increase to combat international child labor abuses is
       inadequate in light of the magnitude of the problem, and provides only a small fraction of
       the $37 million requested.

      OSHA Peer Review. The Committee bill includes language that requires a peer review
       panel for all proposed OSHA regulations. This provision is unnecessary, overly broad,
       and would further delay OSHA's process for issuing regulations. OSHA already has an
       extensive public hearing process where any interested party may testify. OSHA must
       address all significant issues raised. The agency conducts peer reviews when
       appropriate. The Administration strongly urges the House to drop this provision.



        The Committee bill contains several objectionable language riders addressing regulatory
issues in the Department of Labor. These include language imposing new, unnecessary, and
burdensome review procedures before the Department can issue Black Lung regulations and a


                                                5             Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
mines, which have a growing numbers of deaths. These riders would make it more difficult for
the Department of Labor to carry out its programs and should be dropped.

Department of Health and Human Services

       The Administration appreciates the Committee's efforts to provide much needed funding
for important programs crucial to the healthy lives of all Americans. Unfortunately, the
Committee has not provided adequate funding for several important programs of the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Administration has strong concerns with the
inadequate funding levels provided for the following HHS programs (listed in bill order):

      Prevention Research.' The Committee has provided only $10 million of the $25 million
       requested for the Centers for Disease Control to expand research in ways to prevent
       disease and reduce the need for medical care.

      Bio-Terrorism. The Administration urges the House to provide the full $111 million
       requested to improve HHS' ability to respond to attacks of biological and chemical
       terrorism.

      National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. The Committee mark eliminates funding
       for data collection activities of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
       Administration, including the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, which is our
       single best source of information on youth drug use and youth smoking and is important
       for evaluating the impact of substance abuse prevention, treatment, and enforcement
       efforts.

      Health Care Financing Administration (RCFA). Although the Committee has fully
       funded the President's program level request for HCFA Program Management (with the
       exception of the Medicare+Choice information campaign), no action has been taken on'
       the $265 million in new discretionary HCFA user fees. .We urge the House to enact the
       President's requested user fees to finance HCFA activities and to ensure that sufficient
       resources remain available for education and other priorities.

      Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LlHEAP). The Committee would
       eliminate funding for LIHEAP. Over 36 percent of LIHEAP households have
       elderly residents, 32 percent have disabled residents, 27 percent have children under
       the age of six, and 27 percent are the working poor who do not receive any other
       public assistance. The Administration urges the House to restore funds to the
       President's requested level.

      Child Care. The Administration urges the House to provide the additional $174
       million requested for a child care initiative that will improve the availability of
       affordable, quality child care for working parents. This initiative would provide
       States with resources to enhance child care health and safety standards
       enforcement, give child care workers scholarships to improve their skills, and

                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                               6
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
       care system is working. Likewise, we ask the House to restore funds to the
       President's requested level for a $5 million program designed to assist States in
       developing support systems for families of children with disabilities.

      Head Start. The Committee funds Head Start at $4.5 billion, $160 million below the
       President's request -- denying slots to up to 25,000 low-income children in FY 1999 and
       undermining efforts to serve one million children by the year 2002. Head Start has a
       track record of success in readying disadvantaged children for school, supporting working
       families by helping parents to get involved in their children's lives and providing services
       to the entire family. We urge the House to restore Head Start funding to the President's
       requested level.

      Foster Care and Adoption Assistance. The Committee bill fails to provide the
       Administration's request for a $200 million contingency reserve. This language is
       critical to ensure grant awards should the definite appropriations be insufficient for
       authorized eligible expenditures in either Foster Care or Adoption Assistance. The
       House should restore funding to the requested level of $200 million, or approximately
       four percent of total program costs.

      Health Disparities. The Committee has failed to include $30 million requested for
       demonstration projects to address racial and ethnic health disparities in infant mortality,
       cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, HIV / AIDS, and immunizations .

      . In addition, the Committee bill contains several language provisions that are troubling to
the Administration.

      Abortion. The Administration urges the House to strike sections 508 and 509 of the
       Committee bill, which would prohibit the use of funds for abortion. The President
       believes that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. These provisions would continue
       to limit the range of conditions under which a woman's health would pemlit access to
       abortion services. Furthermore, section 509 requires a physician to make a legal
       determination that these conditions have been met. The Administration proposes to
       work with the Congress to address the issue of abortion funding.

      Organ Donation. The Administration strongly opposes two provisions of the Committee
       bill that would suspend two HHS rules pertaining to organ donation: a HCF A rule that
       seeks to expand the number of organs available for donation through more vigorous
       procurement efforts; and, a Health Resources and Services Administration rule that would
       require the national organ transplant network to develop policies that would allocate
       organs based on patients' medical need, not their geographic location.



      Family Planning. The Administration strongly objects to language in the Committee bill
       that requires family planning grantees either to receive written parental consent or provide
                                                 7          Automated Records Management System-
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
    parental consent discourages minors from seeking health care and reproductive services
    and leads to more unintended pregnancies, more abortions and more sexually transmitted
    diseases, including HIV. The Administration urges the Committee to use compromise
    language forged in last year's Act, ensuring that grantees will encourage minors 10 seek
    their family's participation in family planning decisions.

   Needle Exchange. The Committee includes a total ban on the use of funds appropriated
    in this Act for needle exchange programs rather than making the use of funds for such
    programs conditional upon the certification of the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services.                                                                  .

   Office of AIDS Research. The Committee bill does not appropriate a specific amount
    for AIDS research through a single appropriation for the National Institutes of Health's
    (Nm's) Office of AIDS Research. The single appropriation would help NIH plan and
    target research funds effectively, minimizing duplication and inefficiencies across the 21
    institutes and centers that carry out HIV/AIDS research.

   Medicaid Drug Coverage. The Committee bill would prohibit HCF A from paying for a
    specific pharmaceutical agent under Medicaid except for post-surgical treatmcn\. We
    oppose the use of the appropriations process to make selective coverage determinations
    and judgments regarding how best to treat specific medical problems. Further, the
    provision is unnecessary because the Secretary already has authority to limit coverage for
    pharmaceutical agents if prescribed inappropriately, and States already have broad
    latitude to limit the use of drugs under Federal law through drug utilization review and
    prior authorization programs.

   Social Services Block Grant. The Administration opposes a provision that would restrict
    State authority to transfer Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (T ANF) funds to
    SSBG in FY 1999 to no more than the amounts transferred by individual States in FY
    1998. Enacting such a provision so late in FY 1998 would inequitably limit State
    flexibility for the future.

   Potential Health Riders. We understand that several amendments affecting Medicare,
    Medicaid, and public health programs may be introduced on the Housc noor that could
    have a detrimental effect on the Administration's ability to administer its responsibilities
    efficiently and equitably. We urge restraint in the consideration of these issues.

    The Administration strongly objects to language in the House Committee bill, and to
    any related potential amendments, that would have the effect of requiring family
    planning or other health care grantees to receive parental consent or provide
    advance notification to parents before giving contraceptives to minors. Mandating
    parental consent discourages minors from seeking health care and reproductive
    services and thus leads to more unintended pregnancies, abortions, and sexually
    transmitted diseases, including HIV. Federal health program costs could also
    increase if this amendment interferes with the prevention of teen pregnancy. The

                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

           Administration urges the House to adopt the proposed Castle/Greenwood
           amendment, which will ensure that grantees will encourage minors to seek their
           family's participation in family planning decisions.

           The Administration adamantly opposes the proposed Tiahrt amendment that would
           mandate onerous and troubling physical separation requirements between Title X
           supported family planning projects and non-Title X activities related to abortion.
           The Department of Health and Human Services already provides safeguards, as well
           as performs periodic rigorous site reviews, to ensure that no Title X funds are used
           to conduct abortions or abortion related activities.

    Social Security Administration

            The Committee bill does not provide $19 million for administrative expenses, contingent
    on the authorization of a user fee for services provided by the Social Security Administration to
    attorneys who represent claimants for benefits. These services include withholding money from
    certain past due benefits and issuing payments to certain claimant representatives. The
    Administration continues to support enactment of this user fee and appropriation of the
    anticipated collections for administrative expenses.

            In addition, the Committee bill does not provide $50 million for administrative expenses
    for the conduct of additional non-disability Supplemental Security Income (SSI) redeterminations
    of eligibility. These resources and the resulting redeterminations are essential to ensuring the
    integrity of the SSI program and reducing unnecessary benefit payments. Failure to provide this
    funding would result in serious staffing shortfalls.

    Other Agencies

          National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The Committee provides funding for the
           NLRB at the FY 1997 level. This would result in a loss of over 100 staff, an increase in
           case backlogs, and could result in furloughs and office closings. This reduction would
           cripple an agency key to protecting workers' rights on the job, and we urge the House to
           restore the NLRB to the requested level.

           Section 516 amends the National Labor Relations Act to require the NLRB to adjust its
           dollar jurisdictional standards for inflation on October 1, 1998, and every five years
           thereafter. This change would deny workers in some small businesses the protection
           afforded to others to organize and bargain collectively. This change to substantive law
           raising the jurisdictional thresholds more than five-fold should not be done through the
           appropriations process, but only after hearings and debate. The Administration urges the
           House to drop this provision.

          Corporation for National and Community Service. The Administration is deeply
           concerned about the Committee's $27 million reduction to the request for the Corporation
           for National and Community Service. This reduction freezes the Corporation's Senior
           Service program at the FY 19981evel and cuts VISTA $5 million below FY 1998.

                                                    9           Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

        These reductions would deny more than 500 VISTA members the opportunity to serve in
        low-income communities Nation-wide and would reduce the number of seniors serving
        their communities by 15,000. The Administration urges the House to fully fund the
        Corporation at the $279 million level proposed in the FY 1999 Budget.

       Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Administration strongly objects to the lack of
        funding provided for the President's initiative to assist public broadcasters in converting
        to digital technology. The transition to digital technology promises to create tremendous
        opportunities for expanded and enhanced educational and public service programming
        while promoting innovative technology applications. Providing the Corporation with
        funding in FY 1999 will allow public broadcasting to convert to digital technology on a
        schedule similar to that of commercial stations. This will facilitate fundraising efforts
        and allow public broadcasters to participate in the establishment of digital standards.


       Railroad Retirement Board (RRB). The Committee bill does not include language to
        provide the RRB with authority to offer voluntary separation incentive payments (or
        "buyouts") through the end of calendar year 1998. RRB's experience has shown that
        reducing employment through buyouts is much less disruptive to agency operations than
        conducting a reduction-in-force. The Administration urges the House to provide this
        buyout authority.

        The Committee bill includes language prohibiting the RRB Inspector General from using
        funds for any audit, investigation, or review of the Medicare program. The
        Administration believes that this language should be dropped. RRB has statutory
        authority to administer a separate contract for RRB, Part B Medicare claims. As long as
        RRB has authority to negotiate and administer a separate Medicare contract, the RRB
        Inspector General ought not to be prohibited from using funds to review, audit, or
        investigate activity related to that contract.
