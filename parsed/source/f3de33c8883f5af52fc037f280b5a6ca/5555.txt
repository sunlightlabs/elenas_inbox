     SUBJECT:       Health Insurance Coverage Initiatives in the FY 1999 Budget

     Overview

             Throughout your Administration, you have worked to enact legislation to expand access
     to affordable health insurance. Your signing of the Balanced Budget Act included an
     unprecedented $24 billion investment for state-based children's health insurance programs. This
     historic initiative will clearly reduce the number of uninsured. However, there are other
     deserving populations whom we could target in our step-by-step reforms. These include the
     pre~65 year olds (referenced in the Medicare memo), workers between jobs, and workers in small
     businesses. In addition, we are working on possible proposals to expand Medicaid coverage to
     people with AIDS and disabilities through pilot programs. The policy development of these
     proposals is still underway, so we have not included them here.

              Taken together, these are not large initiatives, summing to around $10 billion over 5
     years. This is less than half of the health investments enacted as part of the Balanced Budget
     Act and less 4 percent of the premium assistance proposed in the Health Security Act. Having
     said this, none of your advisors believe the Medicare and Medicaid savings left after last year's
     deficit reduction effort are sufficient to fund these initiatives. There may be $0.5 to 1 billion
     over 5 years in Medicaid savings, but those savings will be difficult to achieve and there may be
     other claims on them (e.g., child care, benefits to immigrants). It could also be argued that, .
     given the link between tobacco and health care, any residual revenue from the tobacco settlement
     or a tax could .be considered for coverage initiatives, particularly those related to children.

             Your advisors uniformly agree that we need to take all actions possible to achieve if not
     exceed your goal of increasing insurance coverage for 5 million children. A series of proposals
     are described to help accomplish that goal. There is less agreement on whether we address a
     new group of uninsured people in this budget. Labor strongly supports the workers between
     jobs demonstration; of all health initiatives in the budget, it is their highest priority. OMB also
     supports that demonstration if sufficient funds are available. While HHS believes that this
     proposal has merit, they are skeptical that it will achieve significant support since it has not in the
     past three years of trying.                       .



                                                       1
A.     CHILDREN'S HEALTH OUTREACH                             Hex-Dump Conversion

       The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides funds for coverage of
millions of working families' uninsured children, a population that previously had trouble
                                                                                       ;

affording coverage. It also builds upon a strong Medicaid program that this Administration has
worked so hard to protect. However, important work remains to be done. In particular, we
need to work with states to enroll the millions of uninsured children in these programs.

        Medicaid eligible children are especially at risk of remaining uninsured. Over three.
million uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid. Educating families about their options and
enrolling them in Medicaid has always been a problem, but it has recently become more
challenging. The number of children covered by Medicaid leveled off in 1995 and, according to
the Census, dropped by 6 percent in 1996. While some of this decline may be due to the lower
number of children in poverty, some part may also result from families' misunderstanding of
their children's continued eligibility for Medicaid regardless of the changes in welfare.

Options to Increase Outreach for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program

       To address the need for children's health outreach, we propose a series of policy options.
Together, these initiatives could cost $1 to 2 billion over five years (or more depending on policy
choices about the enhanced match). Preliminary discussions with NGA and some children's
advocates suggest they strongly support these efforts.. In addition, the Administration is
developing partnerships to encourage a complementary range of private outreach activities.

        Enhanced match for outreach. One option for improving state outreach is to provide
enhanced match to enroll children who are eligible, but not previously enrolled in Medicaid. At
the end of each year, if a state can document that it has increased its enrollment over its baseline,
it would receive a increased matching amount per newly covered child or, alternatively, it could
receive match through an increase in administrative payments. This policy rewards states only if
they succeed in outreach, rather than just matching activities that mayor may not work.
Although its costs depend on the amount of the incentive and the ability to administer this system
efficiently, we could probably constrain costs to $0.5 to 1 billion over five years.

        Moving outreach to schools and child care sites. We could build upon the
"presumptive eligibility" provision in the Balanced Budget Act to make it easier to enroll
children in Medicaid and CHIP. TheBBA option allows limited sites (e.g., hospitals) to give
low-income. children temporary Medicaid coverage on the spot while they are formally enrolled
in CHIP or Medicaid.· This proposal would broaden those sites to include schools and
appropriate child care sites, at the states' option. HCFA actuaries preliminarily estimate that this
would cost $400 million over 5 years. Also, under the BBA, states that use presumptive
eligibility must pay for its costs out of the CHIP allotment, reducing the amount available for
other coverage. States have advised us that this is a disincentive to take this new option.
HCFA actuaries preliminarily estimate that this costs $25 million over 5 years.


                                                 2
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

        Accessing 90 percent matching funds for outreach. A third way to increase funding
for children's health outreach is to increase states' flexibility in using a special Medicaid fund set
aside in T ANF for outreach for children losing welfare. This $500 million fund is currently
allocated to states with a 90 percent matching rate for outreach activities to certain children. We
could expand its use to all children, not just welfare children. HCFA actuaries preliminarily
estimate that this would cost $100 million over 5 years. N GA sUPl'0rts this change.

        Simplifying enrollment. A simple, accessible enrollment process from beginning to
end could encourage more families to enroll their children in Medicaid or CHIP. To help create
such a process, we propose several actions, all of which are low cost initiatives. First, we could
streamline the application process by simplifying Medicaid eligibility and by encouraging the use
of simple, mail-in applications. HCFA has already developed a model, single application form
for both Medicaid and CHIP. We could condition some of the financial incentives, described
above, on using a single or simple application. Second, we are reviewing the feasibility and
costs of a nationwide 1-800 number that will link families with their state or local offices. Such
a number could be placed in public service announcements, on the bottom of school lunch
program applications, and on children's goods like diaper boxes, for example, allowing families
easy access to information.

Discussion

       There is unanimous support across agencies for focusing on children's health outreach.
For HHS and Treasury, it is their first priority in all health initiatives. NECIDPC and OMB
believe that aggressive outreach will be needed to meet or exceed the Administration's goal of
covering 5 million uninsured children. Although we believe this policy will receive validation
by policy experts, children's advocates, and Governors alike, this package of outreach initiatives
may be a communications challenge so soon after the enactment of the $24 billion base
children's health program. In addition, OMB is concerned that we recognize that it is unlikely
that we would enroll all 3 million uninsured children, since there may be some children who are
impossible to reach.

          One great challenge is the difficulty of finding savings from Medicaid to offset the costs
 of this initiative. With this in mind, your advisors are considering the tobacco settlement as a
 financing source. Specifically, we are exploring the advisability of allowing states to retain the
 Federal share of the tobacco funds with an agreement that they dedicate those funds to high
 priority Administration iniatives like child care, education and health care. There is no doubt
 that Governor Chiles would support such an approach if we dedicate the funds to children's
.health care, not just outreach. We are examining policy options should we pursue this path.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
B.     WORKERS BETWEEN JOBS DEMONSTRATION

        Families who lose health insurance while they are between jobs are a small but important
group of uninsured Americans. These families pay for health insurance for most of their lives,
but go through brief periods without coverage when they are temporarily unemployed. If they
experience a catastrophic illness during this transition, the benefit of their years' worth of
premium payments is lost. Worse, should a family lose insurance coverage during the period of
unemployment, they will not be protected by the provisions of the Kassebaum-Kennedy
legislation once they regain coverage. Coverage at that point could be subject to a new
pre-existing condition exclusion period.

Limited Demonstration

       . This policy option is a modification of the program that we have carried in our last two
budgets. It would award grants to several states to provide temporary premium assistance to
eligible low-income families. States would use this money to partially subsidize families'
premium payments for up to 6 months. To truly test how best to address this population's
needs, we would select states using a range of approaches like a COBRA-based subsidy,
Medicaid, or covering the parents of children covered by CHIP.

        Since it!s a grant program, the costs are a policy choice. To give a 'sense of the coverage
for the options, last year's $10 billion proposal over four years covered about 3.3 million people
with incomes below 240 percent of poverty. If we assume the same set of policy parameters, a
demonstration of $1 billion over 5 years would coverage about 230,000, of $2.5 billion would
cover about 600,000, and it would take about $3.5 billion to cover about 800,000 people. OMB
has suggested that we could limit the costs by reducing the eligibility for assistance to people
below poverty. However, NECIDPC advisors oppose such a limitation because it shifts the
target away from the middle class families we originally intended to help.

Discussion

        On policy grounds, all of the agencies support this policy. It has been in our last two
budgets because of its merits. This policy remains Labor's first priority since they view the
unemployed uninsured as a particularly vulnerable and important group to target. They also
believe that this is a particularly important policy in the context of the trade debate and worker.
insecurity issues. OMB would support this initiative if there are sufficient funds. Funding may
be a problem since there is probably not enough Medicaid savings for this option, especially if
we pursue children's outreach. HHS is concerned about supporting this policy with Medicare
savings, believing that Medicare savings should be reinvested for Medicare beneficiaries. HHS
also feels as though circumstances have not changed to make this policy viable this year when it
has not been in the past. DPCINEC are concerned about dropping this policy altogether and do
support a demonstration large enough to viewed as improving coverage. However, if resources
are limited, we would advocate for the children's outreach initiative before this proposal.

C.     VOLUNTARY PURCHASING COOPERATIVES                             Hex-Dump Conversion

       Workers in small firms are most likely to be uninsured. Over a quarter of workers in
firms with fewer than 10 employees lack health insurance - almost twice the nationwide
average. While 88 percent of workers in firms with 250 or more workers are offered health
insurance, only 41 percent of workers in firms with less than 10 workers are offered coverage.
This results. in large part from the fact that the small group health insurance market does not
                                        .
function as well as the large group market. Studies have shown that administrative costs are
higher and that small businesses pay more for the same benefits as larger firms.

Grants to States

        Given the disadvantages faced by small firms, the question is: are there policies that can
make insurance more affordable for small businesses and their employees? In the last two
budgets, we have included a policy to provide seed money for states to establish voluntary
purchasing cooperatives. These cooperatives would allow small employers to pool their
purchasing power to try to negotiate better rates for their employees. This year, we propose both
the original policy and a variation: a competitive grant approach so that a more limited number of
states could receive a smaller, but more targeted, pool offunds. The total costs would be $50 to
$100 million over 5 years.

Discussion

        All agencies remain supportive of this policy and believe it should be included in this
year's budget. It is importan.t that we have some initiative that illustrates our understanding that
a major problem of lack of insurance continues to exist in the small employer community. In
the past, we have been unable .to get this policy passed into law primarily because it has been
viewed as an altemative to an initiative proposed by Congressman Fawell. His approach would
make it easier for small businesses to self-insure and in so doing escape all state regulation.
Governors and consumer groups have consistently opposed the Fawell approach, mostly
because of the concern that the small group market will only be left with the most risky, most
expensive groups, while all the low risk groups will move into the self-insured, non-regulated
market. We have raised similar concerns and have also pointed out that a Fawell-type approach
would eliminate all of the consumer protections state insurance regulation currently provides.
Based on our preliminary conversations with Congressman Fawell, it may be that our impasse is
resolvable since this is his last year as a Member of Congress and there are some compromises
that seem within reach.
