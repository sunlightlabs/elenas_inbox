MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               MIKE COHEN    .
SUBJECT:       Proposed Class Size Reduction Initiative

       We are proposing for consideration in the FY 1999 Budget a $9.2 billion, 5-year initiative
to improve early reading by reducing class size in grades 1 and 2 from a national average of 22.5,
to a maximum of 18, and by taking the steps necessary to ensure that all teachers in those grades
have the knowledge and skills necessary to teach reading effectively in small classes.

        Reducing class size has long been an important goal for parents and teachers throughout
the country. While there are conflicting findings in the research on the impact of lower class
size, two major, well controlled experiments undertaken in the 1980's in Tennessee and Indiana
showed that reducing class size in the early grades to between 15-18 students has a significant
effect on student achievement. While all students benefit from smaller classes, the effects are
largest for the most disadvantaged -- low-income and minority students in inner cities.

        A number of other states are now launching their own class-size reduction initiatives.
(Class size was also a linchpin of Tony Blair's agenda for New Labour in his recent campaign.)
A national effort to reduce class size, led by you and structured as a partnership between the
federal government and state and local governments, would help spread this effort nationally. It
also would provide a concrete way to demonstrate your commitment to help all students meet
challenging national standards.

        Large-scale reductions in class size raise significant issues, especially involving teacher
quality. For example, California's new initiative to reduce class size to 20 in the primary grades
has exacerbated the shortage of fully qualified teachers and, particularly in urban districts, has
resulted in increased hiring of noncertified teachers. It has also increased the need for
professional development for the existing teaching force,in order to help teachers take full
advantage of smaller classes. And many schools have been limited in their ability to reduce
class size because of space limitations in already overcrowded facilities.

        Notwithstanding these challenges, the benefits of significant reductions in class size are
clear. In the first year of implementation, many teachers report that smaller classes enable them
to pay greater attention to individual students, to assign and help them with more challenging
work, to communicate more often with parents, and to have less disruptive classes. Many
parents echo these reports, and support for public schools appears to be on the rise throughout the
state. And many schools and districts are finding ways of meeting the challenges of teacher
quality and facilities. They have found effective ways of training new and experienced teachers.
 Schools have been willing to purchase portable classrooms or make other changes in how they
use facilities in order to make room for smaller classes.


                                                1
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

The proposal described below is designed to help states and districts take advantage of the
opportunities afforded by reductions in class size and to respond effectively to the challenges.
We assume it will be coupled with a robust school construction proposal, which the NEe and
Treasury are designing.

Purpose

        The purpose of this initiative is to reduce class size and provide quality teachers in the
early grades, so that all students leam to read independently and well by the end of the 3rd grade.
 Specifically, this initiative will help states and local communities hire an additional 89,000
teachers over 5 years in order to reduce class size in grades 1 & 2 from a nationwide average of
22.5, to a maximum of 18. At the same time, it will help states and school districts recruit and
prepare new teachers and upgrade the skills of existing teachers in the early grades so they have
the skills necessary to teach reading effectively in small classes.

Funding Stream

        The initiative would provide states and local communities with $9.2 billion over 5 years.
Funding in the first year ($615 million in FY99) would cover the costs of hiring an additional
17,800 teachers, and a similar number would be hired in each succeeding year. Funds would be
distributed to states on a formula basis, taking into account the number of additional teachers
each state would need to reach the class size target, as well as salary differences among the states,
and poverty levels. Within this framework, we are also exploring ways to provide funds directly
to the largest urban areas, as we did in last year's school construction initiative. Funds would
pay for hiring additional teachers, as well as for steps to improve teacher quality, such as
improved pre-service training to enhance the supply of qualified new teachers, professional
development, or incentives for qualified teachers to teach in underserved areas. The federal
government would cover 80% of the costs, with state and local communities providing matching
funds for the rest.


State and Local Plans

         States would be required to work with local school districts to develop a statewide plan
for class size reduction. The plan would include a timetable for phasing in class size reduction,
strategies for ensuring that every classroom had a qualified teacher and for addressing school
facility needs, and a plan for financing the state and local share of the costs. In developing their
plans, states and school districts would be encouraged to look first at how they could reduce class
size by making better use of existing staff and resources, including by reassigning certified staff
who are not in classroom teaching positions to the classroom, and by using Title 1 and other
federal funds to reduce class size rather than continue programs that pull students out of the
regular classroom in order to receive extra help.



                                                 2
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
        States and districts would be given considerable flexibility in designing these plans.
They would be permitted to carry over federal funds from one year to the next, enabling
jurisdictions with the need to invest in preparing and training teachers at the front end of the
process, and scale up class size reductions in later years. In cases where the lack of facilities or
qualified teachers made it virtually impossible to meet the class-size reduction target,
jurisdictions would be able to propose alternative approaches--such as Reading Recovery or
Success for All--to provide intensive, high quality reading instruction in the early grades.


Quality Teachers

        State and local plans would be required to address teacher quality in a number of ways.
States and local districts would have to show:

I) how they will work with institutions of higher education and others to recruit and adequately
prepare the increased numbers ofteachers;
2) how they will ensure the new teachers get high quality, sustained professional development
focused on effective teaching in small groups, on language acquisition, and on effective reading
instruction;
3) how they will recruit and hire new teachers without increasing the percentage of uncertified
teachers already in the classroom--thereby placing a floor on the quality of teachers to be hired;
and,
4) how they would put in place performance-based teacher certification requirements -- teacher
testing for new teachers in the primary grades-- so that new teachers would be required to
demonstrate the knowledge and skills necessary to teach reading effectively in small classroom
settings ..

        We are also considering a requirement that states and districts demonstrate that they have
effective ways of identifying low-performing teachers, giving them help and, if necessary,
quickly and fairly removing them from the classroom.

       While states and districts will be given great flexibility in how to address these issues, the
Education Department will launch a major effort to disseminate information about best practices
and proven approaches to improving teacher quality and reading achievement. States and
school districts would use funds from this initiative, as well as state and local funds and funds
from other federal programs, including Title 1, America Reads, the Eisenhower Professional
Development program, and Chapter 2, to fund the teacher quality component of the initiative.

Facilities

       This initiative will place added burdens on existing facilities, and many school districts
will have difficulty finding adequate space for smaller classes. While states and local
communities continue to have the primary responsibility for addressing this issue, it will be


                                                 3
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

    especially important for the Administration to propose a school construction initiative along with
    this proposal, and continue to press the Congress to enact it. In addition, as indicated above, this
    initiative will provide schools with the flexibility to adopt other proven approaches for providing
    intensive instruction in small groups in order to teach young children to read.

    Accountability for Results

             Local school districts will be required to evaluate the impact of their class size reduction
    initiative on reading achievement, and make midcourse corrections as needed. If, after 3-4 years
    a district cannot show significant gains in reading achievement, it would not receive continued
    funding under this initiative. This provision will provide a strong incentive for all school
    districts to make the most effective use of the all of their resources, and in particular, to use
    proven practices to improve the quality of teaching through this initiative. In addition, the;:
    Education Department will conduct a national evaluation of this initiative, to identify
    implementation problems that need to be addressed and to learn about the most effective
    practices.

    Budget Options

             If the cost of this proposal needs to be scaled back, we can reduce the overall cost by
    setting an objective of reducing the average class size to 18 (rather than a maximum of 18)
    while setting a class size ceiling of 20, or by reducing the federal share of the initiative to 70%
    rather than 80%. Alternatively, it could be phased in over a longer period, such as 7 years.
    The chart below shows the total 5-year cost of these options.


                                      80% Federal Share                 70% Federal Share

     Class size ceiling of 18         $9.2 Billion                      $8.0 Billion

     Class size average of 18,        $7.7 Billion                      $6.7 Billion
     ceiling of 20

     Class size average of 18,        $5.5 Billion (for 5 years)        $4.75 Billion (for 5 years)
     ceiling of 20; 7 year scale up

     This is it. Treasury has given us some more finalized numbers. HUD has
     reviewed and supports expanding the credit. OMB has seen but isn't taking
     a position. While Tax Policy at Treasury has some reservations (as they
     always do), Treasury itself has not taken a position. They are divided.
     Michael Barr supports the expanding the credit.

     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                  BRUCE REED
                            GENE SPERLING

     SUBJECT:               Expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)

     Overview

             This memorandum details· several options to increase the cap on the LlHTC and to
     potentially index it to the rate of inflation in future years. This initiative, along with proposals to
     raise the number of incremental vouchers, expand homeownership, and strengthen the Fair
     Lending Law would build on the housing successes of your first four years.

     Affordable Housing and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

              Enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and made permanent by you in 1993,
     the LlHTC offers corporate and individual investors a credit against their federal income taxes
     based on the cost of acquiring, rehabilitating, or constructing low-income housing. The tax
     credit is a major federal resource for affordable housing, producing 90,000-100,000 low-income
     rental units per year.

             However, because the amount of the LlHTC that can be allocated each year is capped
     relative to the population, its ability to serve its public policy mission is being eroded by
     inflation. The amount of the LIHTC that states may allocate each year is $1.25 times the state's
     population. Since 1986, the purchasing power of the LlHTC has eroded by about 45%; if the
     cap had been indexed in 1986, the current credit would be more than $1.75 per capita.

             After several years of attacks from conservative Republicans to repeal the credit on the
     grounds that it is a form of "corporate welfare" and your repeated vetos of efforts to sunset the
     LIHTC, the credit currently enjoys bipartisan support in Congress and across the nation among
     state and local officials. Senators D'Amato and Graham have introduced legislation (S. 1252)
     that would provide for a significant increase in the annual volume cap. Groups such as the
     Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) are strong supporters of this legislation.

     Options

     1. Index LIHTC for Inflation -- Cost: $175 Million Over Five Years -- An inexpensive option
     would be to change the LlHTC statute and index the LIHTC to the Consumer Price Index. This
     would insure that the credit does not experience any additional future decline in value from
     inflation. However, this proposal would not make up any of the lost value of the credit since
     1986. This would cost roughly $175 million over five years.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
2. Raise the LIHTC Cap -- Cost: $359 Million to $600 Million Over Five Years -- This is a
moderate-cost approach that would partially offset the real loss of the credit value since 1986.
For $359 million over five years, we could increase the credit from its current value of $1.25 to
$1.37 per capita. A more expensive, but still moderate approach, would be to increase the credit
to $1.50 per capita. which would cost approximately $600 million over five years according to
preliminary Treasury estimates. We could also add indexation to one of these increases, but this
would increase the costs. Tax Policy at Treasury notes that indexation would raise the cap
substantially in the outyears which would recreate the inefficiency problems the program suffered
through several years ago.

3. Support S. 1252 {D'Amato-Graham) -- Cost: $1.6 Billion Over Five Years -- This proposal
would increase the annual volume cap of the LIHTC to $1.75 per capita and index it for future
years. This proposal would cost $1.6 billion over five years.

Recommendation

         Tax Policy at Treasury raises several concerns with any raise in the cap on the LIHTC
(e.g., there are more efficient ways to increase low-income housing than using the tax code and
having tight caps increases the efficiency of the program since projects must compete vigorously
for the credit). While their argument has some merit, the LIHTC has proven to be an
increasingly efficient tool and remains the only politically feasible option available to help build
more affordable housing for people with low incomes. Moreover, LISC, Enterprise Foundation,
and the other community development groups view the LIHTC as yours, since you were the one
who permanently extended it. If Congress acts this year to increase the cap -- which is likely --
and we do not have a proposal on the table, you may lose the LIHTC as one of your lasting
legacies.

        The DPC and NEC recommend that you chose option 2. Option 2 would provide a
modest increase in the LIHTC, while ensuring that the efficiency effects from relatively tight
caps remain. The DPC and NEC believe that option 1 -- while ensuring that the credit is no
longer eroded by inflation -- is too small and Tax Policy believes that as the caps are increased
over time, the efficiency of the program would decrease. Option 3 -- at a cost of$1.6 billion--
may not feasible in the current constraints of the budget.
