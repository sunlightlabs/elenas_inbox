           S. 1138 - Y2K Act


(McCain (R-AZ) and 13 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes S. 1138, the Y2K Act.  If S. 1138 were
presented to the President in its current form, the PresidentO,s senior
advisors would recommend that he veto the bill, for reasons noted in
earlier letters to Congressional leadership on this subject. The
Administration, however, strongly supports an amendment that will be
offered by Senator Kerry, with Senators Robb, Daschle, Reed, Breaux, and
     , that would address the AdministrationO,s concerns.  If this
amendment is adopted, it would enable the Administration to support
enthusiastically passage of the bill.

As the new century approaches, the products and services on which the
nation depends must be ready to handle the year 2000 date change. The
Administration recognizes the need to deter frivolous litigation that may
result from actual or potential Y2K failures and agrees that meaningful
and targeted Y2K-specific changes to litigation rules are in order.

The AdministrationO,s overriding concern, as stated previously, is that S.
1138 goes beyond the targeted Y2K changes that are necessary, will not
enhance readiness, and instead may reduce the incentives organizations
have to avoid or minimizeY2K-related problems in the products or services
they market.  S. 1138 would provide protections for defendants by capping
punitive damages, increasing the burden on plaintiffs to mitigate damages,
and limiting the defendant sO, liability to their proportional share of
damages, regardless of whether defendants had been proactive in resolving
potential Y2K problems. As a result, S.1138 would undermine incentives to
act now O} when the damage due to Y2K failures can still be averted or, at
the very least, minimized.

Moreover, S. 1138 would apply to consumer and investor claims.   Recent
Federal legislation already made targeted modifications of the securities
laws to prevent frivolous lawsuits; securities claims should be excluded
from this measure. With respect to consumers, the Administration supports
the approach adopted by the Kerry amendment under which consumer class
action suits would be subject to the requirement that the suits allege a
material defect and plead the defect and damages with specificity.
Wholesale application of the bill to consumers, however, would raise the
bar too high for many consumers who have been harmed, leaving them without
adequate remedies.  In addition, even while S. 1138 prevents consumers
from pursuing legitimate claims, it would provide virtual immunity for
consultants, accountants, and service providers (the 0&bystanders08
described in the bill), extend the benefits of the O&economic 10ss08 rule to
those who have committed intentional torts, and require· courts to enforce
contracts that would otherwise be illegal or unconscionable against those
harmed.

Finally, S. 1138 would effectively move into Federal court class actions
for Y2K claims, creating a heavy burden for the Federal judiciary, over
the strong opposition of the Judicial Conference and in stark disregard
for the traditional division of responsibilities between State and Federal
courts.
The Kerry amendment addresses these concerns and makes targeted
modifications to S. 1138, ensuring that the legislation would encourage O}
not discourage O} readiness and deter frivolous lawsuits while keeping the
courthouse door open for consumers and small businesses with legitimate
claims.
