UNDERAGE TOBACCO      Sets reduction targets of underage use based on the
USE TARGETS         number of years after enactment of the legislation.
                                 Cigarettes Smokeless
                    3 yrs. --     15%            12.5%
                    5 yrs --     30%             25%
                    7 yrs --     50%             35%
                    1Oyrs --     60%                     45%
                    No targets are set for underage use of other tobacco
                    products, such as cigars, little cigars, roll-you r-own , or
                    pipes.

LOOK-BACK           Industry-wide penalties only (no firm-specific).
PENALTIES           Requires HHS to annually determine through surveys
                    (beginning in 3rd year after enactment) the underage
                    daily use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco during the
                    preceding year.
                    Requires Industry to pay tiered monetary penalties
                    (non-tax deductible) for falling short of youth reduction
                    targets.
                    1-5 percentage points short: $80 million per point.
                    6-10 percentage points short: $160 million per point.
                    11 and above percentage points short: $240 million
                    per point.
                    Yearly cap of 3.5 billion with no tax deductibility of
                    penalty payments.

                    liability.
                    If any company misses its share of target by more than
                    20 points, company's liability cap is waived for 2 years or
                    until goal is met, whichever is later, with due process.
                    Liability cap is waived for criminal convictions of violations
                    under this act.


USE OF PENALTV      Transfers 90% of penalty receipts to grants for
AMOUNTS             states/local governments to further reduce youth
                    smoking. Secretary may retain up to 5% of penalty
                    receipts for administration of the look-back assessment.
                    The final 5% of receipts is for a compliance bonus to
                    reward states and retailers who prevent youths (less than
                    5%) from successfully purchasing tobacco products.
                    Secretary may withhold 5% of any state's grant if state
                    fails to enforce compliance with youth access restrictions.

STATE ENFORCEMENT   Compliance goals set (see above Use of Penalty
OF YOUTH ACCESS     Amounts) for state and tribal governments. Funding
LAWS                from settlement for enforcement efforts.
                    Repeals the 1992 Synar Amendment, which was an
                    earlier effort to set targets for the percentage of youths
                    who successfully purchase tobacco products.
                    Percentage of funding withheld for non-compliance is
                    greater in Synar (ranging from 20- 40%, although
                    difference in absolute dollar values are not known).   This
                    amendment is no longer needed because these
                    requirements replace it.

LICENSING OF        Requires state, tribal and federal licensing program to be
RETAILERS           funded from settlement. FDA would draft model state
                    program in consultation with state and local officials.

                    Any ban on nicotine, retail sales, or category of tobacco
                    products would require Presidential notification to
                    Congress and include two-year waiting period for
                    Congress to act. If Congress does not act ban goes into
                    effect.
                    No FDA authority over farmers (e.g., would be no control
                    over genetic manipulation of tobacco leaf).
                    FDA rules must take into account the impact of actions
                    on demand for unregulated contraband products.

CORPORATE           Calls for national and state protocols requiring an industry

                    Research. Industry plan would include specific
                    assessment mechanism and enforcement standards of
                    industry plan to be included in the protocols.           .

                     1999 -- $14.4 billion
                     2000 -- $15.4 billion

                     Each year thereafter, $23.6 billion in real dollars (though the
                     bill has a misprint and says the 2004 amount is $21.0 billion.)
                     Payments are volume adjusted -- increased if consumption
                     volume increases and decreased if volume decreases from 2004
                     levels.
                     Payments are tax deductible.
                     Nominal Net Receipts (FY99-03) -- $71.1 billion
                     Implied Per-Pack Equivalents (Real 1999 $):
                     1999 -- 65 cents per pack
                     2000 -- 70 cents per pack
                     2001 -- 80 cents per pack
                     2002 -- $1 per pack
                     2003 -- $1.10 per pack

SPENDING FROM        Most spending decisions are left to the floor of the
TRUST FUND           Senate.
                     Committee mark specifies funding for:
                                                   5-Year Funding
                     FDA:                          $2 billion
                     States:                               $26 billion (OMB
                                                   estimate)
                     Farmers:                      $11 billion
                     International:                $1 billion
                     Total Spending:               $39 billion
                     Receipts Less Spending:$32 billion
                     Although it is not clearly indicated in the bill, we
                     understand that McCain intended to allow manufacturers
                     to deduct 80% of the $6.5 annual liability cap (see liability
                     section below) from their annual payments. This could
                     reduce the net receipts by an additional $26 billion over 5
                     years.
                     The bill also authorizes funding for NIH, CDC, and
                     AHCPR research using language from the Conrad bill,
                     which included $17 billion for these activities.

FUNDING PRIORITIES   In absence of specific funding recommendations, the bill
                     includes a "Sense of the Senate" amendment indicating
                     that the funds raised by this act should be used to
                     support the following priorities:
                     1. Tobacco use prevention and cessation.
                     2. Tobacco related health research.
                     3. Assist tobacco farmers and tobacco dependent
                     communities.
                     4. Reimburse public health care financingpsograms for
                    tobacco related costs, including Medicare.
                    5. Settle with and reimburse states for tobacco related
                    health care costs and damages, including Medicaid.
                    6. Create a Tobacco Asbestos Trust Fund.
                    7. Provide funding for the Federal Black Lung Program.
                    8. Child Care
                    9. Clinical Trials at NIH.
                    10. Veterans.


CONSENT DECREES     Manufacturers and states enter into consent decrees that
AND NATIONAL        include many of the provisions of the Act, and include a
PROTOCOL            waiver of Constitutional claims.
                    Within 6 months of enactment requires each
                    manufacturer to enter into a legally binding and
                    enforceable contract (The National Tobacco Control
                    Protocol) on both the federal and state level. Federal
                    protocol to be executed with U.S. Attorney General in
                    consultation with the Secretary of HHS. State protocol
                    to be executed with State Attorney General in
                    consultation with state Governor.

NON·PARTICIPATING   Denies non-participating manufacturers liability protection
MANUFACTURERS       and imposes user fees on them equal to the annual
                    assessment paid by participating manufacturers. In
                    addition, non-participating manufacturers must make
                    annual payments into a reserve fund to settle liability
                    claims; the amount is equal to 150% of the payment it
                    would have paid under the bill if the manufacturer had
                    actually been a party to the Settlement.

ATTORNEYS' FEES     All attorney's fees and costs paid by industry outside the
                    payments made under this act.
                    Three member arbitration panel in which plaintiff
                    representative and defendant representatives pick a third
                    member.

CIVIL LIABILITY     Establishes a $6.5 billion cap on annual industry
RESTRICTIONS        payments for individual liability claims against
                    participating manufacturers.          Permits suits by private
                     plaintiffs (incl. class actions and third-party suits), and
                    claims by the federal government, but preempts suits
                    brought by states, local governments and Indian tribes.
                    Permits punitive damages for past conduct (within the
                    cap) and punitive damages for future conduct (outside
                    the cap). Prohibits addiction and dependence claims.
                    Creates a federal cause of action with concurrent
                    jurisdiction in state and federal courts for tobacco-related
                    health injuries. Requires courts to sever trials involving
                    participating and non-participating manufacturers.
                    Creates rebuttable presumptions that: 1) nicotine is
                    addictive; and 2) certain specified diseases are caused
                    by use of tobacco products.
                    The bill does not appear to establish a fund of money
                    from which judgements and settlements are paid
                    (although this may have been intended). Instead, the bill
                    requires the Secretary of the Treasury to keep a record of
                    payments made and judgments and settlements. By
                    rule, the Secretary is to establish a mechanism for
                    ensuring that payments are made to all entitled in the
                    year which the award was made or in a subsequent year.
                     The press release accompanying the bill suggests that
                    the drafters of the bill intended to include the 80%
                    payment; the bill, as drafted, however, does not clearly
                    establish such a fund and makes no reference to the
                    20%/80% model.

INDUSTRY DOCUMENT   Creates National Tobacco Document Depository
DISCLOSURE          Expands the availability of documents in a public
                    depository for use by plaintiffs in actions against the
                    industry and provides for efficient use of these
                    documents. Requires manufacturers to deposit: 1) all
                    deposition of corporate representatives; 2) depositions of
                    all expert and fact witnesses; 3) answers to
                    interrogatories in all cases; 4) court orders on substantive
                    issues; 5) all documents provided in recent specified
                    lawsuits; 6) all health research documents; 7) document
                    indexes maintained by the industry. Allows
                    manufacturers to determine and withhold documents
                    protected by attorney-client privilege. Requires
                    manufacturers to deposit a detailed, itemized log of
                    privileged documents. Establishes a three-judge federal
                    arbitration panel to settle disputes over making privileged
                    documents public.

                    from payments by industry
                    The fund pays for lost tobacco, quota, administrative
                    costs of the tobacco program, to tobacco community
                    Economic Development Grants, Farmer Opportunity
                    Grant Program, and the Tobacco Worker Transition
                    Program.
                    Offers farmers opportunity to stop producing tobacco by
                    selling their quotas.
                    Provides tobacco farmers with educational and economic
                    assistance to find another means of living.
                    Provides general immunity for tobacco producers and
                    warehouse owners.


NATIVE AMERICANS    Provides that the requirements of this Act relating to the
                    manufacture, distribution, and sale of tobacco products
                    apply on tribal lands. Considers tribes as states for the
                    purposes of eligibility for public health funding. Requires
                    Indian tribes to collect any tobacco excise or sale taxes
                    on non-members of the tribes. The Indian tribe shall
                    remit such taxes to the U.S. Treasury, which shall, in turn
                    remit the taxes to the State in which they were collected.

NO STATE OR LOCAL   Allows state and local governments to impose any
PREEMPTION          additional tobacco product control measures that are not
                    inconsistent with the provisions of this Act. However,
                    preemption is imposed in various sections of the Act for
                    certain issues (e.g., packaging and labeling; advertising
                    restrictions; product standards).

INTERNATIONAL       Creates non-profit corporation and provides funds for
TOBACCO CONTROL     international tobacco control programs. Prohibits use of
                    federal funds by federal officials to promote U.S. tobacco
