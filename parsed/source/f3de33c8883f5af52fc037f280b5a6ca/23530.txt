                               Section-by-Section Analysis


        Title XI of the bill would amend Title XIV of the ESEA containing general
provisions relating to the Act.

        Section 1101 (Definitions). Section 1101 of the bill would amend various
provisions of Part A of Title XIV of the ESEA to: (1) amend the definition of the term
"covered program," (2) add a new definition for the term "family literacy services," and
(3) make a number of cross-reference changes from provisions and parts in Title XIV of
the ESEA to provisions and parts in Title XI of the ESEA to reflect the redesignation of
Title XIV as Title XI by section 1108 of the bill. As amended, covered programs would
be: part A ofTitle I; part C of Title I; part A of Title II; part B of Title III; part A of Title
IV (other than section 4115), the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration
Program, and Title VI. The term "family literacy services" would mean services provided
to eligible participants on a voluntary basis that are of sufficient intensity, both in hours
and duration, to make sustainable changes in a family, and that integrate interactive
literacy activities between parents and their children, training for parents on how to be the
primary teacher for their children and full partners in the education of their children,
parent literacy training leading to self-sufficiency, and an age-appropriate education to
prepare children for success in school and life experiences.

         Section 1102 (Administrative funds). Section 1102 of the bin would amend
various provisions of Part B of Title XIV of the ESEA to: (1) revise the list of programs
that are subject to the authority to consolidate State administrative funds; (2) expand the
list of additional uses for consolidated administrative funds; (3) clarify that local
consolidated administrative funds may be used at the school district and school level; and
(4) clarify the circumstances under which a local educational agency may transfer a
portion of its funds under one covered program to another covered program.

         Paragraph 1(A) would revise the list of programs in section 14201(a)(2) of the
ESEA whose administrative funds may be consolidated to include programs under Titles
I, II-A, III-B, and IV -A (other than section 4115) of the ESEA, the Comprehensive
School Reform Demonstration Program, title VI of the ESEA (Class Size Reduction), the
Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998, and such other
programs as the Secretary may designate.

        Paragraph I(B) would amend section 14201 (b)(2) ofthe ESEA to revise the list of
additional uses (for the consolidated administrative funds) to include: (1) State level
activities designed to carry out Title XI (the redesignated general provisions title)
including Part B (accountability); (2) coordination of included programs with other
Federal and non-Federal programs; (3) the establishment and operation of peer-review
mechanisms under the ESEA; (4) collaborative activities with other State educational
                                                              Hex.-DlllTlP Conversion

agencies to improve administration under the Act; (5) the dissemination of information
regarding model programs and practices; (6) technical assistance under the included

        Paragraph 1(C) of the bill would strike out section 14201(t) ofthe ESEA
(relating to Goals 2000).

        Paragraph 2(B) of the bill would make a clarifying change to section 14203 of
the ESEA (consolidation of funds for local administration) to make clear that a local
educational agency may use local consolidated funds at the school district and school
levels for uses comparable to those described above for consolidated State administrative
funds.

        Paragraph (5) would amend section 14206(a) of the ESEA to authorize a local
educational agency that determines for any fiscal year that funds under one covered
program (other than Title I-A) would be more effective in helping all its students achieve
the State's challenging standards if used under another covered program, to use such
funds (not to exceed five percent of the LEA's total allotment under that program) to
carry out programs or activities under the other covered program. The LEA would be
required to obtain the approval of its SEA for this use.

       Paragraphs 2(A), (4) and 5(C) would make conforming amendments.

        Paragraph (3) would repeal section 14204 of the ESEA (relating to administrative
funds study).

        Section 1103 (Coordination of Programs). Section 1103 would amend provisions
of part C of title XIV of the ESEA relating to consolidated State plans and consolidated
local plans and add a new section on consolidated State reporting.

        Section 11 03(1) of the bill would substantially revise section 14302 of the ESEA,
which provides authority for a State educational agency to submit a consolidated State
plan instead of separate State plans for the programs covered by that section.

        Proposed section 14302(a)(I) would direct the Secretary to establish procedures
and criteria under which a State educational agency may submit a consolidated State plan
meeting the requirements of section 14302. An SEA would be authorized to submit a
consolidated State plan for any or all of the covered programs in which the State
participates and the additional programs described in proposed section 14302(a)(2). These
additional programs include: (1) the Even Start program under Title I-B; (2) the
Neglected or Delinquent program under Title I-D; (3) programs under Title II-A ofthe
Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998; and (4) such other

        Proposed section 14302(a)(3) would provide for the State development and
submission of a consolidated State plan. Under section l4302(a)(3)(A), an SEA desiring
to receive a grant under two or more programs to which the section applies would be
authorized to submit a consolidated State plan. Under section I 4302(a)(3)(B) that agency
would not be required to submit a separate State plan for the programs included in the
consolidated State plan. Proposed new section 14302(a)(3)(C) would provide that the
SEA must comply with all legal requirements applicable to the programs included in the
consolidated State plan as if it had submitted separate State plans.

        Proposed new section 14302(a)(4) would specify that an SEA desiring to receive
funds under a program subject to section 14302 for fiscal year 2001 and the succeeding
four fiscal years must submit a new consolidated State plan meeting the requirements of
that section.

        Proposed section 14302(b) would provide for the content ofa consolidated State
plan. Proposed section 14302(b)(I) would direct the Secretary to collaborate with SEAS
and other named parties in establishing criteria and procedures. Through this
collaborative process, the Secretary would establish for each program the descriptions
and information that must be included in the plan. Proposed section 14302(b)(I)(B)(ii)
would direct the Secretary to ensure that a consolidated State plan contains, for each
program included in the plan, the descriptions and information needed to ensure proper
and effective administration of that program in accordance with its purposes. This
provision is designed to strengthen the consolidated plan as an instrument of effective
administration of each program included.

       Proposed section 14302(b)(2) would require an SEA to describe in its plan how
funds under the included programs will be integrated to best serve the needs of the
students and teachers intended to benefit and how such funds will be coordinated
between other covered programs not included in the plan and related programs (such as
Reading Excellence, Twenty-first Century Learning Centers and the Teacher Quality
Enhancement Programs under Title II of the HEA.

        Proposed new section 14302(c) would require an SEA to include in its
consolidated State plan any information required by the Secretary under proposed new
section 11802 regarding performance indicators, benchmarks and targets and any other
indicators or measures that the State determines are appropriate for evaluation of
performance.

       Proposed new section 14302(d) would require an SEA to include in its
consolidated State plan a description of the strategies it will use under proposed section
11503(a)(4) and (5) (relating to State monitoring and data integrity).

        Proposed new section 14302(e) would establish procedures for peer review and
Secretarial approval. The Secretary would be required to establish a peer-review process
to assist in the review of consolidated State plans and provide recommendations for
revision. To the extent practicable, the Secretary would be directed by proposed new
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
section 14302(e)(1) to appoint individuals who: (1) are knowledgeable and the programs
and target populations; (2) are representative of SEAs, LEAs, and teachers and parents of
students served under the programs, and (3) have expertise on educational standards,
assessment, and accountability.

        Proposed section 14302(e)(2) would direct the Secretary to approve a plan if it
meets the requirements of the section and would authorize the Secretary to accompany
such approval with one or more conditions. Under proposed new section 14302(e)(3) the
Secretary would be required to notify the State of that determination and the reasons for
it. Proposed new section 14302(e)(4) would require the Secretary, before disapproving a
plan to offer the State an opportunity to revise the plan, provide technical assistance, and
provide a hearing.

       Proposed new section 14302(f) would provide for revision and amendment of a
consolidated State plan.

        Section 1103(2) of the bill would amend section 14303(a) of the ESEA to provide
for uniform State assurances regarding monitoring and data integrity. Paragraph 2(B) of
section 1103 would insert a new paragraph (4) in section 14303 requiring the State to
assure that it will monitor performance by LEAs to ensure compliance with the
requirements of the ESEA and, in so doing, will: (I) maintain proper documentation of
monitoring activities; (2) provide technical assistance when appropriate and undertake
enforcement activities when needed; and (3) systematically analyze the results of audits
and other monitoring activities to identify trends in funding and develop strategies to
correct problems. Paragraph 2(B) would further amend section 14303(a) of the ESEA by
adding a new paragraph (5) requiring the State to assure that the data the State uses to
measure its performance (and that of its LEAs) under the ESEA are complete, reliable,
and accurate, or, if not, the State will take such steps as are necessary to make that data
complete, reliable and accurate.

        Section 11303(3) of the bill would amend section 14305 of the ESEA (relating to
consolidated local plans). Proposed sections 14305(a)-(c) would clarify and restate
current law. Under proposed section 14305(a) an LEA receiving funds under more than
one covered program may submit plans to the SEA under such programs on a
consolidated basis. Proposed section 14305(b) would authorize an SEA that has an
approved consolidated State plan to authorize or require its LEAs that receive funds
under more than one program included in the consolidated State plan to submit
consolidated local plans for such programs. Proposed section 14305(c) would require an
SEA to collaborate with LEAs in the State in establishing procedures for the submission
ofthe consolidated local plans. For each program under the ESEA that may be included
in a local consolidated plan, proposed new section 14305(d) would authorize the
Secretary to designate the descriptions and information that must be included in a local
consolidated plan to ensure that each program is administered in a proper and effective
manner in accordance with its purposes.
                                                            Hex-Dwnp Conversion

        Section 1103(4) ofthe bill would make conforming amendments to section 14306
of the ESEA (relating to other general assurances), and section 1103(5) would repeal
section 14307 ofthe ESEA (relating to relationship of State and local plans to plans
under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act).

        Section 1103(6) of the bill would amend Part C of Title XIV ofthe ESEA by
adding a new section 14307 authorizing the Secretary to establish procedures and criteria
under which an SEA that has a consolidated State plan must submit a consolidated State
annual performance report. Proposed section 14307 would require that the report include
information about the covered programs, including the State's performance under those
programs, and other matters, as the Secretary determines, including monitoring activities
under proposed new section 11503(a)(4). Submission of a consolidated performance
report would take the place of individual performance reports for the programs subject to
it.

       Section 1104 (WaiversLSection 1104 of the bill would amend section 14401 of
the ESEA relating to waivers.

        Section 1104(1) would amend section 14401(a) of the ESEA to add the Carl D.
Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 and part B of title VII of the
Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act" as programs to which section 14401
applies. Section 1104(2) would amend section 14401(b)(I) to require that an SEA, LEA,
or Indian tribe that desires a waiver submit an application to the Secretary containing
such information as the Secretary may reasonably require. Each such application would
be required to: (1) indicate each Federal program affected and the statutory or regulatory
requirements requested to be waived; (2) describe the purpose and expected results of the
waiver; (3) describe, for each school year, specific, measurable goals for the SEA and for
each LEA, Indian tribe, or school that would be affected; and (d) explain why the waiver
would assist in reaching these goals. Section 1104(3) would make conforming
amendments to section 14401(c), relating to restrictions on the waiver authority, would
add health and safety to the list of requirements that may not be waived.

        Section 1105 (Uniform provisions). Section 1105 of the bill would amend various
provisions of Part E of Title XIV of the ESEA relating to uniform provisions concerning
maintenance of effort and participation by private school children and teachers.

       Section 1105(1) would amend section 14501(a) of the ESEA, relating to
maintenance of effort, to make that section inapplicable to Part C of Title I of that Act.

          Section 1105(2) would amend section 14503 ofthe ESEA by adding a new
subparagraph (B) to section 14503(a)(3). The proposed new subparagraph would provide
that, if the needs of eligible children enrolled in private schools are different from the
needs of children enrolled in public schools, an LEA must provide services and other
benefits to the private school children that address their needs. Section 1105(2) would
further amend section 14503 by making it apply to programs under: Title I-C; Title I-E;
Title II-A, to the extent provided in section 2135(a); Title III, Title IV-A (other than
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

section 4115), and Title VII ofthe ESEA. Paragraph (2) would also amend section
14503(c)(I), relating to issues to be covered by consultation between designated public
educational agencies and appropriate private school officials. These new issues would be:
(I) to the extent applicable, the amount of funds received by the agency that are
attributable to private school children; and (2) how and when the agency will make
decisions about the delivery of services to these children.

        Section 1105(2) would also amend section I 4503(c)(2) to clarify the timing of
such consultation. Under the proposed new section 14503(c)(2), such consultation would
be required to: include meetings of agency and private school officials, to occur before
the LEA makes any decision that affects the opportunities of eligible private school
children or their teachers to participate in programs under the Act, and to continue
throughout the implementation and assessment of activities under section 14503.

      Paragraphs (3) and (4) amend sections 14504 and 14506 to make conforming
amendments to cross-references. Paragraph (5) repeals sections 14513 and 14514 of the
ESEA.

        Section 1106 (Gun Possession.) Section 1106 of the bill would repeal Part F of
Title XIV of the ESEA relating to gun possession. This authority would be transferred to
Title IV of the ESEA by section _of the bill.


        Section 1107 (Evaluation and indicators). Section 1107 of the bill would amend
Part G of Title XIV to revise section 14701, relating to evaluation, and to add a new
section 14702, authorizing the Secretary to establish performance indicators for each
program under the Act and Title VII-B of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance

subparagraphs that would authorize the Secretary, with the funds reserved under the
section, to: (I) conduct evaluations to carry out the purposes of the Government and
Performance Results Act of 1993, and (2) work in partnership with the States to develop
information relating to program performance that can be used to help achieve continuous
improvement at the State, school district, and school level. Section 1107(2) would also
substitute for paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 14701 new subsections (b) through (e).
Proposed new section 14701 (b) would direct the Secretary to use funds reserved under
subsection (a) to conduct independent studies of programs under the Act and the
effectiveness ofthese programs in achieving their purposes, to determine whether the
programs are achieving the standards set forth in the subsection. Proposed new section
14701 (c) would direct the Secretary to establish an independent panel to review these
