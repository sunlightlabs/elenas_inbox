Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director June OO,Neill testified before the

CONGRESS TODAY (2/13):

SENATE:
Adopted (83-15) Specter Resolution regarding milk prices.  The resolution
states that there is a crisis in the dairy industry.  It says that the National
Cheese Exchange (WI) should be represented as a factor in dairyO,s Basic
Formula Price, and that "Exchange prices may have been manipulated downward."

By unanimous consent, the Senate confirmed the nomination of Janet Yellen as
Chairman of the PresidentO,s Council of Economic Advisors and Aida Alverez as
Administrator of the Small Business Administration.
