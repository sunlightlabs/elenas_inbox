MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               MIKE COHEN

SUBJECT:       UPDATE ON NATIONAL TESTS

This memo outlines the current status of the national testing initiative in Congress, and our
strategy for winning the fight to keep the initiative on track.

I. Current Status and Recent Developments
The conferees have begun to meet, but are not expected to take up the testing issue until many
other issues are addressed. We have two distinct objectives in conference: (1) security an
authorization along the lines of the Senate provision, permitting us to proceed with the testing
under NAGB's auspices, and, (2) ensuring that the bill provides the $16 million needed for
continued test development.

For the most part, the Appropriations Committee members have argued that a resolution of this
issue will require us to reach an agreement with Goodling, though by all accounts, Goodling is
firmly locked into his position with the strong support of the House leadership. Last Friday he
sent you a letter implying that he will not move an America Reads bill forward as long as you
continue to advocate for the tests.

There has been one preliminary staff-level discussion for the purpose of exploring options.
Republican staff floated the idea of proceeding with test development now, but requiring separate
authorization for test implementation. We do not think that is a good deal for us.

Conservative Republican Senators who supported the CoatslNAGB compromise have come
under strong pressure from the Eagle Forum, and 14 of them switched sides last week and signed
a letter written by Ashcroft, threatening to filibuster the appropriations bill if it does not contain
Goodling's prohibition on the tests.

In contrast, Democratic support is holding firm. Last week, 43 Democratic Senators signed
letter written by Bingaman, threatening a filibuster if the conference report does not let your
testing initiative go forward.

The work on test development has been proceeding over the last several weeks. The test
specifications which would provide the blueprint for test development were completed, and new
advisory committees organized by the test development contractor began to meet.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
For a number of reasons, these developments were greeted with some alarm by key Republicans
in the Congress (e.g., Coats, Specter, and Riggs) and elsewhere (e.g., Finn, Ravitch, Bennett and
Engler). The test specifications included a provision permitting students to answer all test
questions with the aid of a calculator. Continued work on test deVelopment was seen as
ignoring a strong Senate vote to take responsibility for the tests away from the Education
Department as well as a strong House signal to stop work altogether. It was being seen as a
deliberate effort to undermine the compromise which would put NAGB in charge, by getting as
much of the test development nailed down before NAGB could take control. Therefore, at our
urging last week, Secretary Riley issued a statement criticizing the calculator decision, urging
NAGB to reverse it when it assumes control of the test, and temporarily halting work on test
development until we can turn this over to NAGB. Assuming that the appropriations process is
completed within the next 4-6 weeks, this step should not materially affect our ability to conduct
a pilot test this Spring as planned.



II. Communications
Our overall approach over the coming weeks is to convince the Republicans that they are fighting
a losing battle by opposing us again on education issues. We will highlight the national tests as
the centerpiece of your campaign improve public education through a comprehensive strategy of
promoting higher standards and greater accountability; increased parental involvement and public
school choice through charter schools; and investments in programs that can lead to improved
teaching and learning, such as technology. This is contrasted with an extreme opposition that is
trying to undermine improvements in public education and walk away from our schools, by
blocking the tests, pushing for block grants which end important programs and cut investments,
and promoting voucher efforts that will weaken public education. We will wage a continuing,
high profile campaign over the next few weeks, with following events being planned:

      Your voucher statement on Tuesday
      Announcement by Secretaries Riley and Herman of new School-to-Work grants on
       Tuesday
      The Vice President's release of an Education Department Study on the importance of
       father's involvement in education on Thursday
      A meeting with John Doerr, James Barksdale and other high-tech CEO's on Oct. 8, prior
       to your departure to New Jersey.
      A meeting with business leaders who support the test, on Oct. 20 or 21
      A meeting with the newly formed Learning Alliance for public education, a consortium
       of 12 national organizations involved in K-12 education working to promote a
       standards-based reform agenda at the local level, the day after the business leaders
       meeting
      A meeting with labor union leaders supportive of education [many played key role in
       STW and Skill Standards Board]
      If schedule permits, the Vice President's participation in a joint meeting ofthe Council of
       Great City Schools and U.S. Conference of Mayors, where an additional 4-5 cities would
       announce their participation in the tests, Oct 15-18
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
      One or more in depth background briefings on the stakes for public education for selected
       press, by the Vice President or First Lady and Secretary Riley
      porus release of ED report on algebra courses/possible release ofEDINSF math
       directive action plan
      porus announcement of new plan for recycling surplus federal computers to schools
      Use of Sunday talk shows (LewislRiley)
      Development of common education agenda/message with Congressional Democrats for
       Fall [check with Podesta?]
      Continued efforts by Secretary Riley and Deputy Secretary Smith to talk to editorial
       boards in newspapers in communities in key states and congressional districts
      Launch similar editorial board efforts by selected Cabinet members and WH staff



III. Outreach
Our outreach efforts have been focused in a number of areas. DPC and Education Department
staff meet weekly with education and business groups that support the tests to share information
and coordinate strategy [can I say this?]. We have also worked closely with other business
leaders and groups, including Lou Gerstner and John Doerr. As a result, we have learned that:

      A number of business leaders have unsuccessfully submitted supportive op-eds to key
       newspapers; several are now considering buying ads instead.
      Lou Gerstner is trying to secure an endorsement for the tests by ACHIEVE. The six
       CEO's on the Board and four of the Governors (Engler, Romer, Hunt and Miller are
       supportive; Voinavich and Thompson have not yet agreed).
      John Doerr has written to governors and state education officials, as well as big city
       education leaders, thanking those who have signed up for the tests and urging others to
       join. In addition, they are focusing their attention on the Congressional battle.
      Business and education groups alike have sent alerts to their grass roots membership
       urging them to contact their Congressional delegations and to promote the testing
       initiative in the press.

The Office of Intergovernmental Affairs has worked regularly to shore up the Governors and
Mayors already participating in the tests, keep them apprised of the Congressional battle, and
reach out to additional state and local elected officials.

Education Department and DPC staff continue to meet with civil rights groups in an ongoing
effort to respond to their concerns and to educate them about the implications of placing NAGB
in charge of the tests.

We have also been in close contact with Checker Finn and Diane Ravitch, urging them, together
with Bill Bennett and John Engler, to work privately and publicly to maintain Republican support
in the Senate and help find a toehold in the House. .

IV. Legislative
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
As indicated above, we have secured our Democratic supporters in the Senate through Sen.
Bingaman's letter, and are relying on business groups and Finn and Bennett to hold as many
Republicans as possible.

In the House, securing Republican support for something along the lines of the Senate provision
is key. In addition, we continue to explore ways of reducing the opposition from the Black and
Hispanic Caucuses, though securing their support without turning around the Republicans will
not substantially advance our cause.
Secretary Riley and his staff have reached out to possible Republican allies. They are trying to
get Mike Castle, who spoke in favor of the Senate provision on the floor and has previously
served on NAGB, to enlist moderate Republican support on a letter urging the conferees to
support the Senate provision.

We are considering another call from Secretary Riley to Bill Goodling, though do not think the
time is right for this just yet.

In addition, we anticipate that any compromise will need to modify the Senate provision at least
somewhat, and we are working with ED to prepare proposals that we can support. These might
include language that prohibits the Education Department from developing national curriculum
in reading and math, or that delays full test implementation for a year, while providing for a field
test in interested states and districts in 1999.

Secretary Riley has also met with the three members of the CBC who opposed the Goodling
amendment -- Chaka-Fattah, Al Wynn, and Harold Ford, to seek their advice on how best to
secure the support of the Black Caucus. They noted that the primary concern of caucus
members is school construction, and that members feel strongly that we have failed to fight
sufficiently hard for our proposal. The scepticism among caucus members is so high that there
is little we can do on this front in the short term on this issue that would tum the caucus around.
However, there are two school construction tax-credit proposals likely to be introduced in the
near future, both as alternatives to Coverdell-like provisions to provide IRA tax free withdrawals
for K-12 education. One will be offered by Rangel in a Ways and Means mark-up, and the other
by Daschle if Coverdell offers his proposal in the Senate. We believe that it will be helpful for
us to endorse at least one of these proposals if they begin to move in Congress.

We have been working closely with the Council of Great City Schools to explore commercially
available 4th grade reading tests in Spanish that are aligned to NAEP frameworks and
performance standards. There is at least one such test already available -- essentially the
equivalent of a Spanish-language version of the national reading test. Our strategy is for the
Great City Schools and the local superintendents to take the lead in persuading the Hispanic
groups and the Hispanic Caucus that this test provides what they have been asking for. We then
would help ensure that these tests could be administered and reported in coordination with the
national tests, and be prepared to support paying for their administration.

Finally, DPC and NEC, along with the Education Department, are developing two new initiatives
that should be of considerable interest to both the Black and Hispanic Caucuses. One is our
                                                                  Hex-Dwnp Conversion

response to Chaka-Fattah's proposal for a Pell Grant guarantee, while the other is an urban
initiative focused on supporting standards-based refonns (including ending social promotions,
intervening in failing schools, and removing incompetent teachers). We believe it may be useful
to begin to work collaboratively with both caucuses on these initiatives, as a signal to them that
we are working to provide resources and opportunities for minority students.

v.  Additional Steps for You
