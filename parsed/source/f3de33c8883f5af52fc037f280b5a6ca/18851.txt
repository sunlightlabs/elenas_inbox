MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                   Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                Meeting with Congressman Waxman

        As you know, we have been using the last few weeks to lay the groundwork for a
possible bipartisan summit to negotiate comprehensive tobacco legislation. We have been (1)
attacking Republican plans to enact piecemeal legislation; (2) praising comprehensive bills, such
as Senator Conrad's, which meet the President's principles; and, (3) holding one-on-one meetings
with key House and Senate Members.

Talking Points

        Congressman Waxman, as you know, is one of Congress' toughest tobacco critics. He
thinks that we should be taking a harder line, and he fears that we will be too quick to rush to a
deal. He thinks that we can get a bill that doesn't give the industry anything, i.e., liability limits.

       In response, you can say:

                We will hold out for a high standard, and that we will not do anything that
                 undermines our public health goal of dramatically reducing teen smoking.

                We don't like liability limits either, but we think that the most important thinks for
                 now is to get the Republicans to agree to a comprehensive bill that raises the
                 costs of cigarettes to children and impose tough penalties on companies that sell
                 to kids, reaffirms the FDA authority to regulate nicotine like the drug it is, and
                 ends tobacco company advertising that targets kids.

                The President has made clear he wants a bipartisan solution to this problem. He
                 said so on September 17 when he announced his plan, he has met with leaders of
                 both parties, and senior Administration officials have met and will meet with
                 Democratic and Republican leaders to help draft legislation.

                Time delays mean lives -- everyday 3,000 kids start smoking and 1,000 of them
                 will die prematurely from this addiction. Congress should pass this legislation
              this year.                                            u I Hex-Dump Ccnve:slon

Background

       On September 17th, President Clinton announced that there are five key principles that
must be included in any comprehensive tobacco legislation. They are:

              I. Tough penalties and price increases to reduce youth smoking. Price
              increases of up to $1.50 if necessary over the next ten years.

              2.Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products. Nicotine is a drug.
               Its use in a product needs to be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

              3. The tobacco industry must change the way it does business, including
              stopping advertising to children.

              4. There needs to be progress towards other public health goals including
              cutting second-hand smoke and better funded programs to help people quit
              smoking.

              5. There should be protection for tobacco farmers and their communities so
              they do not suffer economically because of this legislation.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                   Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                Meeting with Senator Mack

       As you know, we have been using the last few weeks to lay the groundwork for a
possible bipartisan summit to negotiate comprehensive tobacco legislation. We have been (1)
attacking Republican plans to enact piecemeal legislation; (2) praising comprehensive bills, such
as Senator Conrad's, which meet the President's principles; and, (3) holding one-on-one meetings
with key House and Senate Members.

Talking Points

         Senator Mack's support will be key to enacting bipartisan tobacco legislation. He has a
long history of supporting anti-cancer efforts and is particularly interested in funding research
efforts (as you may know, many members of his family have had cancer). He has made
statements indicated his interest in the legislation -- we'll want to use this meeting to find out
more about his views.

       In general, you can say:

                The President has made clear he wants a bipartisan solution to this problem. He
                 said so on September 17 when he announced his plan, he has met with leaders of
