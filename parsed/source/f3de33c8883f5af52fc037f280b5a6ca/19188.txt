        Acknowledgments and Introduction. [tk]


        I am not ordinarily the Administration's spokesperson on issues
like tobacco. But I am here today, not only as the Chief of Staff of this
Administration, but as a businessman, as a North Carolinian, and as a
parent, to talk to you about the President's plan to protect our children
from tobacco.


        Consider these facts:


               Smoking kills 430,000 people ever year -- it kills more people
                than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and
                fires combined. Smoking is still by far the largest preventable
                cause of premature death in the United States.


               Nearly 90% of smokers started smoking before they turned 18.

                                          -1-
           five years after starting -- yet only one in five actually manages to
           quit.


          Every day, 3,000 young people will become regular smokers, and
           1,000 will die sooner as a result.


     At the same time, multi-million dollar marketing campaigns have
been designed to get our children to light their first cigarettes.


         In the past months, new documents have come to light that
          conclusively prove that tobacco companies aimed to sell their
           deadly products to children as young as 12.


         These documents are a shocking reminder that our children are
          under siege by a deadly and powerful enemy -- and it is up to us to
          protect our children.




                                              -2-

threat of tobacco is right at the top of the President's agenda -- and this
administration is fully committed to working with the bipartisan
leadership in Congress to achieve this goal.


          This is not a matter of politics        n_ it is a matter of priorities.   Many
          Members of Congress from both parties have shown enormous
           leadership on this most important issue.


          Congressman Waxman has been in the forefront of this issue for
          years -- providing the powerful leadership it took to bring us to the
          critical point we have reached today.


         Congressman Bliley has recently done the American people a great
           service by getting thousands of pages of documents from the
          tobacco companies posted on the Internet so all the world can see
          how the tobacco companies have gone after our children.




                                            -3-

    worked long and hard to introduce tobacco legislation that this
    Administration can support.


   Senator McCain [and Senator Hollings] has/have provided great
    leadership in the Commerce Committee to put together a bipartisan
    bill that embodies the President's principals.


   We must not let protecting our children's lives become an election
    year political fight. It must be a national commitment of the
    highest priority.

-- and experience shows -- is the best way to stop young Americans from
smoking before they start. His plan would:


         Raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over 5 years and
          $1.50 a pack over the next ten years;


         Affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;


         Impose strict restrictions on advertising aimed at young people; and


         Assess stiff penalties for selling cigarettes to minors.

stop teenage smoking will save 1 million lives over the next five years.


         Last week, Vice President Gore announced that new estimates show
          that our proposal would have major effects on youth smoking in
          every state, with reductions ranging from 33% in Washington State
          to 51 % in Kentucky.


         For every dime added to the price of cigarettes, up to 70,000 fewer
          teenagers will begin smoking and more than 20,000 premature
          deaths will be avoided.


         Price increases alone are projected to reduce teenage smoking by
          29%. Youth access and market restrictions in the President's plan
          are projected to reduce teenage smoking by an additional 11 %.




         The combination of the price increase called for in the President's
          plan plus the tighter restrictions on youth access and marketing, will

    and 2003 -- and help us avoid approximately 1 million premature
    deaths.




Tobacco companies must also be part of the solution.


    As the President has said, advertising aimed at adults is legal, but
     tobacco companies must draw the line at our children.


    Our proposal requires tobacco companies to help establish
     smoking cessation programs for adult smokers, and to launch
     public education campaigns aimed at children to keep them from
     smoking in the first place.

is tragic -- and as a businessman, I can tell you that the economic cost to
our society is extraordinarily high.


          Smoking related illness costs approximately $60 billion every
          year -- that's more than the federal government spends on
          education, child care, and medical research combined.


          Smoking during pregnancy results in 2,500 fetal deaths every
          year, and costs $4 billion per year -- which is close to double
          what we spend on cancer research each year. [still working on
          number more kids that could insure}


         Fires caused by smokers cost another $500 million every year;


          Smokers die earlier and retire sooner -- and this is estimated to
          cost our economy as much as $80 billion every year in lost output,
           lost productivity, and lost wages.

their hard-earned tax dollars. But if we pass the President's plan, we will
take the first important steps to reducing these costs, increasing productivity,
and most importantly, saving lives.


     We know that this plan will be good for America -- and as a North
Carolinian -- born and raised in tobacco country -- I can tell you that we
must also make sure that we treat our tobacco farmers fairly.


          The President has made protecting tobacco farmers and their
           communities one of the five key elements for his plan for
           comprehensive tobacco legislation.

    public and protecting the well-being of farming communities.
    Recently, a remarkable coalition of farming groups, including
    burley and flue-cured growers, and public health groups,
    including the American Heart Association and the American
    Cancer Society, came together around a shared set of
    principles. That is a consensus we can build on.


   We will use some of the revenue from raising the price of
    cigarettes to make sure that we save our kids without
    devastating our farm communities.                That is a commitment
    this Administration has made, and we are optimistic that a
    consensus is forming in Congress to use some of this money to
    help tobacco farmers.

budget in 30 years. This budget protects our children from the harms
of tobacco -- and our nation from the burdensome costs associated with
teen smoking.    This budget also ~ the very money raised by raising
the price of cigarettes to invest in the future of our nation. Our budget
uses the tobacco money for:

         Critical investments in health research, including biomedical
          research, cancer clinical trials, and children's health outreach --
          increasing by nearly 50% the funding for the National Institutes of
          Health.


         We also make historic investments in child care and after-school care
           -- doubling the number of working families who receive child care,
          and increasing the number of students receiving after school care;
          and lastly,

          size, hiring 100,000 additional teachers, and building or
          rehabilitating 5,000 schools;




     Finally, and most importantly, as a parent of three kids, I can tell you
that when I hear the statistics I mentioned earlier, my blood runs cold.


         When I hear that the tobacco companies have deliberately tried to
          get our children to smoke -- despite the fact that a full third of the
          3,000 kids whostart smoking every day will die prematurely -- I
          know that we must not rest until we have done everything we can
          to protect our children from tobacco.

over the next five years. We must not miss this historic opportunity.


         As President Clinton recently said: "We stand on the verge of one
          of the greatest public health achievements in history -- an historic
          triumph in our fight to protect America's children from the deadly
          threat of tobacco."




         As Chief of Staff of this Administration, as a businessman, as a
          North Carolinian, as a parent, and as an American -- I ask you to
          support our efforts, and to work with us in a bipartisan manner to
          meet this vitally important challenge.


     Thank you.
