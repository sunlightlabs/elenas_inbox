     TEXT:
     Below is the draft House Letter regarding the Foreign Operations
     Ap~ropriations bill.  Markup is tomorrow (Thurs. 9/10) at lOam; therefore,
     we need your comments/clearance by 7:30pm tonight (sorry for the short
     notice).  Thank you.

     The Honorable Bob Livingston
     Chairman
     Committee on Appropriations
     U.S. House of Representatives
     Washington, D.C.  20515

     Dear Mr. Chairman:

              The purpose of this letter is to provide the AdministrationD,s
     views on the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs
     Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Subcommittee. As
     the Committee develops its version of the bill, your consideration of the
     AdrninistrationD,s views would be appreciated.

              The Administration appreciates efforts by the Subcommittee to
     accommodate certain of the PresidentD,s priorities within the 302(b)
     allocation. However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the
     necessary investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result, a
     number of key programs are seriously under-funded, which raises issues of
     congressional support for an effective foreign policy, a strong national
     security policy, and continued economic prosperity.   In addition, and of
     grave concern, the major portion of the request for the International
     Monetary Fund is not approved, and there are a number of objectionable
     restrictions on the funding that is provided in the bill.   If the bill
     were presented to the President in its current form, the PresidentD,s
     senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.

             This legislation is a critical element of America's national
     security budget. At the dawn of a new century, America faces unique
     challenges and unprecedented opportunities to strengthen our national
     security, enhance our global leadership, extend the reach of our
     democratic values, and deepen our own prosperity. The challenges we face
     are formidable.  If this bill in its current form were to become law,
     however, it would erode our ability to promote effectively critical
     American interests at home and abroad.  It would require us to walk away
     from problems that can and must be solved. The responsibility for
     safeguarding our national security and exercising U.S. leadership must be
     foremost when allocating scarce fiscal resources. We urge the Congress to
     provide the leadership needed to keep America safe, strong, and prosperous.

             The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level for the
     programs funded through this bill is to offset discretionary spending by
     using savings in other areas. The PresidentD,s FY 1999 Budget proposes
     levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that conform to the
     Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings through user fees and
     certain mandatory programs to help finance this spending.  In the
     Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis
     took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
     programs paid for with mandatory offsets.  In addition, this year, as in


the past, such mandatory offsets have been approved by the House and
Senate in other appropriations bills. We want to work with the Congress
on mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be used to
increase funding for high-priority discretionary programs, including those
funded by this bill.

International Monetary Fund

        While the Administration welcomes the SubcommitteeD,s efforts to
provide funding for the International Monetary FundD,s (IMFD,s) New
Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), we are extremely concerned by the
SubcommitteeD,s failure to include in its bill the requested appropriation
for the $14.5 billion u.s. share of the IMFD,s critically needed quota
increase. since February of this year, the President has repeatedly
called on Congress to approve the full amount of his $18 billion budget
request for the IMF. To reject or delay this funding not only would
undermine AmericaD,s leadership in the world; it also would expose
American workers, savers, farmers, and businesses to unacceptable economic
risks.

        The IMFD,s financial resources are nearing historic lows,
necessitating the recent activation of the IMFD,s emergency credit lines,
the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), for the first time in twenty
years. Without the entire $18 billion in new funding, composed of the
quota increase and the u.s. share of the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB),
the IMF -- and hence the United States and the world -- will remain
vulnerable if new, escalating, or spreading systemic crises occur.   To
protect AmericaD,s economic strength, Congress must act now to pass the
full quota.
        The SubcommitteeD,s bill proposes several conditions on IMF
funding that, while directed at objectives we share, are unworkable in
their current form and, therefore, would have the effect of delaying
indefinitely the availability of these critical resources to the IMF.   We
urge the Congress to respond to these concerns as the bill moves through
the process.

New Independent States

          As recent events have indicated, the incomplete, peaceful transition of
the New Independent States (NIS) to stable, market democracies is vital to
the U.s. national security. The Congress has shared this view and
provided considerable support for this program in the past.    The current
political/economic situation in Russia highlights how great the stakes are
for the United States to continue to help Russia achieve this peaceful
transition. The enormous economic potential of the Caspian Basin
represents great opportunities to advance our mutual goals.    Therefore,
the cuts embodied in the Subcommittee's funding level for USAID assistance
programs to the NIS are especially unfortunate.   These cuts would make it
extremely difficult to push for market reforms and support democratic
forces across the region.   With respect to continued restrictions on U.S.
assistance to Azerbaijan, the Administration strongly favors repeal.
These restrictions are a disincentive for securing peace in the Caucasus
and do not serve U.S. national interests.

Middle East Assistance

        The Administration welcomes the efforts of the Subcommittee to
work with us in encouraging changes in traditional levels of assistance to
countries in the Middle East. We believe that Israel's initiative to
reduce Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance provides an important basis
.,
"




on which to build future assistance programs that meet our needs in the
Middle East and beyond. However, due to the very constrained funding
levels for international affairs programs, the Administration has proposed
an accelerated approach to the reduction of Israel's ESF. We would
encourage the Committee to give strong consideration to such an approach
as the bill proceeds through the process.

Economic Support Fund

         The Administration is concerned with the overall funding level for
the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account. At the Subcommittee mark, the
account would not nearly have sufficient resources to continue supporting
economic and political stability in Latin America, and in other emerging
democracies in Africa and Asia.   We strongly encourage the Committee to
support a higher funding level for the ESF account as the bill moves
forward.   In addition, the restrictions on assistance to Haiti need to be
balanced with a national interest waiver to ensure that the President has
sufficient flexibility to pursue our national interests.

Global Environment Facility

         The Administration is concerned with the refusal of the
Subcommittee to fund the PresidentD,s request for the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) , which is helping to reduce long-term environmental risks
that will affect all Americans. The $300 million request for GEF (of
which $192.5 million is arrears) is needed to assure that the GEF does not
run out of resources in FY 1999. Concerns that funding the GEF would
prejudge debate on the Kyoto Climate Protocol are misplaced:   the new
replenishment agreement is funded at the same level as the prior one, and
the GEF will continue with precisely the same broad work program that it
had prior to Kyoto.   The GEF is among the best vehicles that the United
States has to encourage developing countries to shoulder greater
responsibility for protecting both the local and global environment.   It
is manifestly in our interests to clear our arrears and keep the GEF
running, and the Administration strongly urges the Committee to restore
funding for this critical program.

Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs   (NADR)

        The Administration is concerned with the $64 million, or 30 percent, cut
to the $216 million request for NADR.  This reduction would undermine the
mUlti-prong effort that NADR supports to reduce the proliferation threat
to U.S. national and global security. Lack of funding for the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Preparatory Commission would harm U.S.
 national security interests as it would eliminate planned improvements in
our ability to monitor nuclear testing worldwide.  The recent Indian and
Pakistani tests are a stark reminder of the importance of this
monitoring. As well, we would be forced to reduce support for NIS science
centers, demining efforts, and other related activities.

Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO)

        The Agreed Framework reached between the United States and the
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea in 1994 remains the key tool with
which we are able to engage with North Korea on a range of bilateral and
multilateral issues, including missile tests.  In addition to the
unacceptable certification language and funding cuts currently in the
bill, we would strongly oppose additional congressional cuts in, or
elimination of U.S. funds for KEDO.  These cuts would allow North Korea to
blame the United States for not fulfilling our commitment to the Agreed
"




Framework and, in essence, give the North an D&outD8 to begin reprocessing
fissile material currently monitored under international safeguards.  Such
an action would seriously destabilize security on the Korean peninsula,
place U.S. troops in greater danger, and exacerbate the Asian financial
crisis.

    Peacekeeping Operations

        The Subcommittee has reduced the $83 million request for
Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) by 25 percent. PKO provides vital
assistance and support for many important national security and foreign
policy activities, including commitments in Bosnia and Haiti, conflicts
in Africa, and potential trouble spots such as in the Balkans.   This
reduction would severely limit the PresidentD,s ability to respond to
these and other evolving events.

    Trade and Investment Financing

         The Administration appreciates the SubcommitteeD,s effort to
increase substantially the funding for the Export-Import Bank and to
support the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and
Development Agency (TDA).   However, Export-Import Bank funding still falls
short of the level needed to meet the expected demand of U.S. exporters in
FY 1999.   Support for TDA, at 17 percent below the PresidentD,s request,
is insufficient to allow the agency to remain engaged around the world,
especially given its growing program in the Caspian region.

U.S. Agency for International Development   (USAID) Operating Expenses

        The Administration is concerned with the $24 million cut in the
request for USAID Operating Expenses. This reduction would not only make
it impossible for USAID to carry out Presidential initiatives in Africa
and Latin America, but also would interfere with the agencyD,s ability to
manage its ongoing programs effectively, including congressional
priorities in areas such as infectious diseases and child survival, as
well as to address management priorities.  In particular, this reduction,
combined with the House action striking the emergency fund in the Treasury
and General Government Appropriation bill, would make it difficult for
USAID to implement fully its Year 2000 conversion. Even if USAID were to
begin closing missions and eliminating additional positions immediately,
the fixed costs of doing so would prevent AID from achieving the savings
necessary in FY 1999 to respond to this cut.  For these reasons, we urge
the Committee to restore funding for USAID Operating Expenses.

    International Disaster Assistance

        In light of the continuing needs created by both natural disasters
and ongoing civil conflicts, we urge the Committee to provide a higher
level of funding for this account.  The Subcommittee mark would cripple
our efforts to respond expeditiously and effectively to countries in
transition from crisis caused by political and ethnic conflict and could
undercut our ability to address man-made and natural disasters.

U.S. Agency for International Development Credit Programs

        The Administration is concerned that the Subcommittee has not
funded the modest $6 million request for credit subsidy for the Urban
Environment (UE) credit program, or provided transfer authority for
USAIDD,s Development Credit Authority (DCA). As the Congress and the
Administration agreed in the FY 1998 appropriations legislation, USAID has
'.
taken substantial steps towards developing the capacity to manage both its
existing and future credit portfolios. We urge the committee to restore
the transfer authority for the DCA and the subsidy request for the UE
program.  Failure to do so would limit the ability of USAID to use credit
to promote development in urban areas and to encourage the development of
needed private sector financial mechanisms.

u.s. Agency for International Development Child Survival,     Diseases, and
Basic Education

        The prohibition on the use of funds from the Child Survival and
Disease Programs Fund for non-project assistance, which is specifically
authorized in the Foreign Assistance Act, would weaken USAIDD,s current
leadership position with bilateral and multilateral donors to encourage
and support policy reforms in sub-Saharan African countries.

Exchange Stabilization Fund

        The Subcommittee bill contains a provision that would limit the
PresidentD,s flexibility to utilize the Exchange Stabilization Fund as
necessary to protect AmericaD,s economic and security interests.  For this
reason, and because the Exchange Stabilization Fund is not germane to the
purposes of this appropriations bill, the Administration opposes this
provision.

Treasury International Affairs Technical Assistance Program

        The Administration is disappointed that the Subcommittee has not
funded the $5 million request for this program, which could significantly
enhance the transition to stronger private sector-led growth and more
efficient, transparent, and better supervised financial institutions in
emerging economies, including reforming countries in Africa and financial
crisis countries in Asia.  Given the large potential benefits and modest
cost of this program, which provides technical assistance in tax policy,
development of domestic capital markets, and privatization of state
enterprises, we urge the Committee to fund the request.

International Organizations and Programs (IO&P): U.N. Population Fund
(UNFPA)

        The Subcommittee bill reduces the request for IO&P by $55 million and,
unfortunately, eliminates funding for UNFPA, which provides support for
women in family planning matters in a number of countries not served by
u.S. assistance programs. UNFPA does not fund abortions.   The overall
reduction in IO&P would limit u.S. ability to participate and support a
number of international organizations.

Peace Corps

        The Administration regrets that the bipartisan Peace Corps
initiative to fund 10,000 volunteers by the year 2000 has not received the
full request of $270 million from the Subcommittee.  However, we are
heartened by report language stating that the Subcommittee is prepared to
approve a further increase should there be a reallocation of funds later
in the appropriations process.

Community Adjustment and Investment Program (CAIP)

        The Administration is concerned with the Subcommittee's failure to
fund the Community Adjustment and Investment Program, a program initially
·   I'   '.




         funded through the North American Development Bank, a multilateral
         development bank. The CAIP was established to help communities affected
         by adverse trade patterns associated with implementation of the North
         American Free Trade Agreement. To date, the program has assisted in more
         than 120 loans in 20 states, leveraging private sector financing of over
         $70 million. The $37 million requested would significantly bolster the
         CAIPO,s ability to continue this work, as well as to support technical
         assistance, grants, and micro-lending.  The Administration urges the
         Committee to restore funding for this innovative program.

         Year 2000 Conversion

                  In the FY 1999 Budget, the President requested more than $1 billion for
         Year 2000 (Y2K) computer conversion, including specific amounts in the
         requests for the agencies funded in this bill.  In addition, the budget
         anticipated that additional requirements would emerge over the course of
         the year and included an allowance for emergencies and other unanticipated
         needs. On September 2nd, the President transmitted to the Congress a
         request for $3.25 billion in FY 1998 contingent emergency funding for Y2K
         computer conversion activities. This supplemental request would create a
         funding mechanism that is consistent with both the needs anticipated in
         the President's budget and the Senate's action creating a $3.25 billion
         contingent emergency reserve to provide the resources and the flexibility
         necessary to respond to critical unanticipated Y2K-related requirements.
         It is essential that this contingent emergency funding be enacted as
         quickly as possible, whether through the Treasury/General Government bill
         or another legislative measure moving through the process earlier,
         particularly in light of the decision of several Subcommittees, including
         the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, not to fully fund the base
         requests of a number of agencies for Y2K conversion.  We urge Congress to
         leave as much as possible of the reserve unallocated so that funds are
         available to address emerging needs.

                 We look forward to working with you to address our mutual concerns.

                                                         Sincerely,
