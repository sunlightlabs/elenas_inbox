      TEXT:
      Andrew Mayock of Sylvia Matthews' office asked me to get in touch with you
      concerning the policy options for the President's Racial Reconciliation
      Initiative. As you may recall, I passed out a one page fact sheet at a
      meeting last month that outlines the Metropolitan Initiative that I am
      working on with the President's Council on Sustainable Development
      (attached).  I have been engaged in Administration discussions about
      "metropolitan compacts" since Chris Edley was the champion of this policy
      approach in the fall of '94.

      The PCSD's metropolitan work has never been explicitly about race.   But
      one of its primary goals is to identify common ground that exists between
      inner cities and suburbs to identify win-win approaches to improving
      economic security and quality of life that benefit both. But because the
      metro initiative is about facilitating a dialogue between cities and
      suburbs it could easily include a racial reconciliation component.

      The new PCSD task force on Metropolitan and Rural Approaches will be
      co-chaired by Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Susan Savage of Tulsa, and Scott
      Bernstein, President of the Center for Neighborhood Technology, a CDC in
      Chicago.  It won't hold its first meeting until late July/early August.
      But enough spadework has been done on this issue over the last few years
      that it could be featured in the President's upcoming speech.

      Please give me a call at 66550 and maybe we can meet to discuss this
      further.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

                             THE METROPOLITAN INITIATIVE

     Background:

             Initiative emerged from the sustainable communities work of the President's Council on
            Sustainable Development;

             Part of an emerging consensus in support of "forging metropolitan solutions to urban
            and regional problems" (see attachment).

     Basic Assumption:

             The time is right for bold experiments to bring together cities and their suburbs to
            produce economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental quality.

     Three Specific Questions:

            We want to launch 4 to 6 pilots to address three specific questions:

            1) How can we help create smart citizens by using federal information and technical
            assistance programs to give people in a region the tools to solve local problems?

            2) How can we promote smart money by targeting existing federal spending to
            effectively address the needs of a metropolitan region?

            3) How can we encourage smart regulation that meets federal goals in a manner
            consistent with the unique circumstances of metropolitan regions?

     Explicit Goals:

             To redefine the relationship between the federal government and metropolitan regions;

             To identify the common ground that exists between cities and suburbs by creating
            regional partnerships to clean up brownfields, reduce traffic congestion, move people
            from welfare to work, prevent crime, and curb urban sprawl.

     Implicit Goal:

            This implicit goal could be made explicit:

             To promote racial healing by engaging urban and suburban constituencies in a
            partnership to identify common ground on issues related to economic security and quality
            of life.
