                  An. Historic Return to Sound Fiscal Footing
              Deficit Reduction During the Clinton Administration

   The President inherited a budget deficit of $290 billion that was expected to explode to over one-half
    trillion dollars in 2002. The economy's growth was stagnant and jobs for many Americans were hard to
    find. A decade of large deficits had weakened the foundation of our economy, cast doubt on the country's
    ability to self-govern, and'sapped our power and prestige abroad.

   President Clinton addressed this problem of fiscal instability immediately, moving during the first days
    of his Presidency on a pledge to cut the deficit in half. Working with Democrats in Congress, he
    implemented an economic program designed to reduce the deficit and to invest in critical priorities, such as
    education and training. That economic program also instilled in law a fundamental principal of the
    President's: no Americans who work hard at their jobs should have to raise their families in poverty.

   The 1993 economic plan has exceeded all expectations: the economy has produced over 12 million new
    jobs, the unemployment rate is at its lowest point in 24 years, and the deficit has fallen by 63 percent,
    falling four years in a row to $107 billion in 1996. Mounting evidence suggests the deficit will fall again
    this year, lengthening the streak of declining deficits to five years -- the longest in 50 years. Private sector
    growth has averaged a robust 3.5 percent, benefitting from the improved investment climate to which deficit
    reduction has heavily contributed. Most recently, during the first quarter of this year, the economy surged
    ahead at a 5.6 percent rate, the fastest growth in a decade.

   The President began his second term determined to fulfill his goal of balancing the budget. With this
    bipartisan balanced budget agreement, working with both Republicans and Democrats, the President finishes
    the job.

   As we head into the next century, this bipartisan balanced budget agreement solidifies the nation's
    economic foundation, restores faith in our ability to govern ourselves, and bolsters our preeminent
    position in the world economy.

   Budget balances by 2002 -- for the first time since 1969

New Initiatives

   Agreement provides $34 billion over 5 years for new initiatives, including:

            $14 billion for restoring medical and disability benefits to legal immigrants and other improvements to

            Provides $16 to $17 billion to provide health coverage for up to 5 million children by 2002

Discretionary Spending

   Non-defense discretionary outlays are within 1 percent of the President's FY 1998 Budget request over 5 years
   -- protecting education, the environment, international and other priorities

   Defense spending meets President's FY 1998 Budget request (on budget authority)

Medicare & Medicaid

   Medicare savings of $115 billion over 5 years, extending the life of the Trust Fund until at least 2007

            Modernizes Medicare by providing new health plan choices such as PPOs and PSOs and new
            preventive care benefits, including annual mammograms without co-payments, diabetes
            self-management, and colorectal screenings

            Reforms outdated payment methodology for home health, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient
            departments, and HMOs

            Phases in, over time, cost of home health care into Part B premium with expanded low income
            protections

   Medicaid: Imposes new cost constraints (e.g., on disproportionate share hospital payments), while
   maintaining the Federal guarantee. The agreement responds to States' concerns by dropping the per capita cap
   proposal, and allowing States more flexibility to manage their Medicaid programs.

Education

   Largest increase in education spending in 30 years

   $35 billion for education tax cuts, including the Hope Scholarship and the $10,000 tax deduction

   Increases maximum Pell grant award to $3,000

 PRESIDENT CLINTON WOULD NOT ACCEPT ANY BALANCED
BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT EXPAND EDUCATIONAL
             OPPORTUNITIES IN AMERICA.



                  TO OPEN THE DOORS OF COLLEGE, THIS
                     BUDGET AGREEMENT INCLUDES:


     Pell Grant Expansion. Includes the largest increase in two decades -- a funding boost of
      25%. The maximum award will reach $3,000, an increase of $300. In the 1998 budget
      alone, an additional 348,000 students will receive grants: 130,000 young people from
      moderate-income families, and 218,000 low income students over the age of 24.

     Tax cuts for higher education. To help make college affordable for all American families.

     Work-Study. Will continue to expand the availability of work-study jobs, including an
      increasing number of community service positions, moving closer to the President's
      commitment to 1 million work-study jobs by the year 2000.

  EXPAND ACCESS TO HEAD START AND EARLY HEAD START
         A Commitment to Enrolling 1 million children in Head Start in 2002. The President has
          long been committed to making Head Start, and now Early Start, available to more
          children. The agreement adopts that goal, accepting the President's proposal for
          increases from 1998 to 2002.

         Over the past 4 years, the President, working with allies in Congress, has secured a 43%
          increase in funds for Head Start. The program will serve 800,000 in 1997, and the 1998
          budget will bring in 86,000 more children.

  AMERICA READS CHALLENGE

         The President has launched the America Reads Challenge to ensure that all kids read
          well and independently by the end of the third grade. This commitment includes:

          _   America's Reading Corps. Will provide individualized after-school and summer
              help for over three million children in grades K-3. Federal aid would be used to
              help communities recruit and train over 1 million tutors.

  WORKING TO ENSURE THAT EVERY 12 YEAR-OLD CAN
  LOG ON TO THE INTERNET
             Technology Literacy. Doubles funding to help ensure that computers are in every
              classroom, every classroom is connected to the Internet, all teachers are trained, and that
              high quality software and on-line resources are available to help schools integrate
              technology into the curriculum so that students can become technologically literate.
                                                                  Automated Records Management System

   THE PRESIDENT FOUGHT TO ENSURE THAT ANY BALANCED BUDGET AGREEMENT
    EXPANDS CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE. HIS CHILDREN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE
    PROVIDES HEALTH COVERAGE FOR AS MANY AS FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL
    CHILDREN BY:

    _   Strengthens Medicaid for Children. The President fought to ensure that the guarantee
        of Medicaid coverage for all poor children is preserved. Furthermore, the Agreement
        invests in expanding Medicaid coverage for poor children by:

            Working to enroll many of the three million children who are eligible but not enrolled
             in Medicaid;

            Providing States with new options to expand coverage to children; and

            Continuing Medicaid coverage for children with disabilities who lost coverage due to
             definitional changes as well as impoverished legal immigrants.

    _   Supports Innovative State Programs through a Capped Mandatory Grant Program.
        States could receive grants to:

            Cover children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to
             afford private coverage; and

            Builds on innovative programs that address the unique needs of children in each State.
                                          For example, programs like State/insurance company
                                         partnerships and school-based could be expanded.

                   . FORWARD TOWARDS A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT:



ACCELERATE TOXIC WASTE CLEANUPS

   Double the Pace of Superfund Cleanups. In contrast to earlier Republican efforts to
    slow cleanups down, the President has achieved a near doubling of the pace of
    Superfund cleanups. The budget provides for:
           The cleanup of 500 additional sites by the end of the year 2000 so millions of
           Americans can enter the next century in healthier neighborhoods.
           A $650 million increase over 1997 for Superfund, bringing total funding to $2.1
           billion in 1998.

EXPAND BROWNFIELDS REDEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE

   Tax Incentives for Distressed Areas. The President's Brownfields Initiative helps
    communities cleanup and redevelop contaminated areas with grants and targeted tax
    incentives, creating jobs and protecting public health.

           Funding is boosted $75 million in 1998 to provide grants to communities for site
           assessment and development planning and to leverage state, local, and private
           funds to foster redevelopment.

IMPROVE AMERICANS' RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT TOXICS

   Expanding Community Right-to-Know. The budget includes new funds to expand the
    information people get about toxic threats to their families and communities.

MORE AGGRESSIVE CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT AGAINST POLLUTERS

    Stepped-Up Enforcement. President Clinton is committed to more aggressive
    enforcement efforts against polluters. The budget provides:
           Increased funding to train state and local officials who work at the local level to
           enforce environmental laws.
           An increase to the account which funds EPA enforcement.

     EXTENDS THE LIFE OF THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND UNTIL AT LEAST
     2008.

     MODERNIZES MEDICARE. The Agreement contains a series of structural reforms
     which modernize the program, bringing in line with the private sector and preparing it
     for the baby boom generation. It:

     cJr    Increases the number of health plan options -- by making Preferred Provider
            Organizations and Provider Sponsored Organizations -- available to Medicare's
            seniors and people with disabilities.

            Improves Medicare managed care payment methodology and informed
            beneficiary choice. Addresses geographic disparities in payments; and adjusts
            managed care rates for overpayments due to favorable selection.

            Builds on the successful hospital prospective payment system model,
            implementing prospective payment systems for skilled nursing home facilities,
            home health, and hospital outpatient departments.

     EXPANDS PREVENTIVE BENEFITS

     cJr    Waives cost-sharing for mammography services and provides annual
            screening mammograms for beneficiaries age 40 and older to help detect
            breast cancer;

     cJr    Establishes a diabetes self-management benefit;

     cJr    Covers colorectal screening (early detection of cancer can result in less costly
            treatment, enhanced quality of life, and, in some cases, greater likelihood of
            cure);

            Increases reimbursement rates for certain immunizations to protect seniors
            from pneumonia, influenza, and hepatitis.

                       Immigrants who are already in the country, are not now receiving benefits and
                       subsequently become disabled will also be fully eligible for SSI and Medicaid
                       benefits.

                       New Entrants. Partially restores SSI and Medicaid benefits for future arrivals
                       who become disabled after entry--sponsor deeming will be applied with respect
                       to both programs.

                       Children. Restores SSI (and Medicaid) benefits for disabled legal immigrant
                       children who are now in the country. For children who arrive in the future,
                       sponsor deeming will be applied with respect to both SSI and Medicaid
                       eligibility.

                       Refugees and Asylees. Extends the SSI and Medicaid eligibility period for
                       refugees and asylees from 5 years after entry (the limit in the welfare bill) to 7
                       years, in order to give these residents more time to naturalize.

             Childless adults. Last year's welfare reform bill harshly restricted food
             stamps for able-bodied childless adults to only 3 out of every 36 months, unless
             they are working. This move ignored the fact that finding ajob often takes
             time. The budget agreement adds $750 million to the Food Stamp program,
             and redirects existing program funds, to create 190,000 new work slots for food
             stamp recipients subject to the "3 in 36" time limit.

             Allows States to exempt up to 15 percent of the food stamp recipients who
             would otherwise be denied benefits as a result of the "3 in 36" limit.

             These two provisions together will preserve food stamps for approximately
             half of the able-bodied adults who, even though they are willing to work,
             would otherwise be ineligible for benefits.

FINISH THE JOB OF WELFARE REFORM

             Additional resources for areas of particular need. Adds $2.0 billion to the
             Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, to be targeted
             to high-poverty, high-unemployment areas. A share of the additional dollars
             will go directly to cities with large poverty populations. These resources will
             give States and cities the help they need to place welfare recipients living in the
             most disadvantaged areas into lasting jobs.

             These funds could be used for wage subsidies to private employers,
             transportation and other post-employment supportive services essential for job
             retention, and other effective job creation and placement strategies.

             Extra incentive for employers. Most welfare recipients want to work.
             The agreement establishes an enhanced welfare-to-work tax credit, to
             provide private employers with an incentive to give recipients a chance.

             The welfare-to-work tax credit" in the budget agreement would allow
             employers to claim a credit of up to 50 percent of the first $10,000 in wages
             paid during a year to a worker who had been on welfare for a prolonged
             period of time. The credit is available for up to two years per worker,
             giving employers an incentive to not just hire, but make efforts to retain
             long-term welfare recipients.

             In addition, expands the existing work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) to
             include, as one of the eligible populations, individuals subject to the "3 in
             36" food stamp limit.
