TEXT:
Attached is a summary of the Education DepartmentO,s ESEA reauthorization
proposal regarding Bilingual Education. This is still a work in
progress--the Department is still working to nail down a number of
important details on this, and is consulting with the relevant groups as
it continues its work. As this proceeds, I wanted to make sure each of
you knows the status of the proposal and has a chance to weigh in in a
timely fasion.

These proposal address changes to Title VII (Bilingual Education) and to
Title 1, which serves more LEP students than does Title VII.   The
proposals closely reflect the principles we developed last year in
announcing our opposition to the Unz initiative, including increased
flexibility, greater emphasis on ensuring qualified teachers for whatever
approach a local community chooses,  increased accountability for results,
and a 3-year goal for becoming proficient in English.  Briefly, here is
how the DepartmentO,s proposal reflects those principles:

1.  Increased Local Flexibility.  The DepartmentO,s proposal would:
  Remove the cap in current law that limits funding for O&special
alternative English programs08 to 25% of the Title VII funds.  This means
that preference is no longer given to traditional bilingual programs, and
makes it easier to fund ESL, English-language immersion and other
approaches.

 Maximize parental choice by requiring parental approval for participation
in Title VII programs.

2.  Teacher Quality.  The DepartmentO,s proposal would:
 Increase the supply of qualified bilingual and LEP teachers through a new
initiative to recruit mid-career, bilingual professionals into teaching

 Expand the use of Title VII funds to support pre-service and in service
teacher training programs that help equip all teachers to teach LEP


students.

3. Goal of English Language proficiency in 3 years/Increased
Accountability for Results.  The DepartmentD,s proposal would:
 Require annual assessment of English Language Proficiency for LEP
students served in both Title VII and Title 1 programs, with results
provided to parents, teachers and administrators. The tests should be
used by educators to guide needed modifications in instruction, to help
each student become proficient in English within 3 years.

 Require that LEP students who have been in a US school for less than 3
years be included in the Title 1 assessment system to the extent
practicable, in the language and form most likely to yield information
about what these students know and can do.  This is an extension of
current law, and generally means that students would be tested in their
native languages rather than in English, if such tests are available.

 Require that LEP students who have been in a U.S. school for three years
or more be tested in reading and language arts in English, without any
special accommodations, and included in the overall evaluation of the
school as required under Title 1. This is a change in current law, and
reflects our emphasis on a 3-year goal and strengthened accountability,

 Require Title 1 schools with LEP students that are not making progress in
helping students become proficient in English within 3 years to implement
an improvement plan.  If no improvement occurs, states and school
districts would be required to intervene, as an integral part of the
PresidentD,s proposal to require intervention in low performing schools.

 Make continued funding under Title VII dependent on the school
districtD,s success in helping students become proficient in English
within three years, and in moving students into mainstream classes.


         Several things are important about how the three year goal is
approached.   First, this proposal places responsibility for reaching the
three-year goal with the schools and school systems, not the student.
Students who do not meet the goal receive extra help, but are not removed
from bilingual education classes. Second, the proposal defines the goal
as demonstrating proficiency in reading in English within 3 years, as
opposed to exiting from a bilingual or ESL class within 3 years.   This
means that the goal is defined in terms of student performance rather than
school program placement decisions.   It also means that school districts,
subject to parental approval, will have the flexibility to keep students
in bilingual or ESL classes after three years if this is appropriate for
the student.   I believe this is the right approach.

        Note also that, while being fully consistent with the Unz
principles we developed last year,  the DepartmentD,s proposal contains an
additional emphasis which promotes the goal of helping all students learn
a second language. The Department would approach this objective by
strengthening an existing Title VII program that provides grants to school
districts to promote foreign language instruction, and by giving priority
to two-way bilingual education programs.   These programs combine LEP and
English-speaking students in the same classroom, and teach both
languages. There is growing evidence that when implemented well, students
in these programs develop dual language proficiency and do well
academically also.  I think this approach makes sense.==================== ATTACHMEN

           Limited English Proficient Students and the Reauthorization of ESEA

Improving education for limited English proficient (LEP) students through reauthorization
requires changes to several programs within ESEA. While Title VII has been the section of
ESEA most closely identified with services for LEP students, most LEP students are served
through Title 1. Other programs under ESEA, including those addressing literacy, technology,
and extended learning opportunities, are important sources of support for LEP students.

Given this reality, the Department of Education has undertaken a coherent approach to ensuring
that LEP students needs are addressed in the reauthorization process. The strategies that make
up this approach are framed by four guiding principles:

Principle 1: Ensure teachers are well trained to teach LEP students.

Principle 2: Focus on student performance. Provide flexibility for local school districts to
design their own programs contingent on their being accountable for improving student
achievement.

Principle 3: Increase accountability for all programs serving LEP students with the goal that
LEP students reach English proficiency after three years.

Principle 4: Work toward the goal of having every child fluent in at least two languages


Improving the Training of All Teachers to Teach LEP students:

Background

      The majority ofLEP students have a primary teacher who is not well qualified to provide
       services to LEP students. The 1995 National Education Goals Report indicates that 40%
       of all teachers reported they had LEP students in their classrooms, but only 29% had
       received any training to teach LEP students.

      Funding for professional development programs in bilingual education was doubled from
       $25 million to $50 million in FY99 and the President is proposing another $25 million
       increase in FY2000 to meet the increasing demand for fully certified bilingual teachers
       and English-as-second-language teachers.

Recommendations for Reauthorization

      Create an authority for a national demonstration project to recruit bilingual professionals
       into the teaching profession on a large-scale (Similar to Troops for Teachers).

      Improve and expand professional deVelopment for all teachers of LEP students. Because
                                            f lex-Dump Conversion

       FY99 is the first year that Training for All Teachers (Title VII, subpart 3) has been
       funded, there are not yet any indicators of its success; it would be premature to alter it in
       any significant way. However, the reauthorization proposal will include priorities within
       the competition to focus on innovative pre- and in-service programs that use Title VII to
       leverage support and build partnerships to develop large-scale efforts to reach large
       numbers of teachers within a school district.

      Support significant institutionalized changes throughout all (not just bilingual and ESL)
       teacher education programs. Require that mEs applying for Title VII grants provide
       evidence of a broader plan to improve teacher education programs to include preparation
       for all teachers serving LEP students. This effort would be aligned to/included in any
       teacher quality proposal introduced in ESEA.

Provide Flexibility for Local School Districts:

Background

Due to demographic shifts, schools are serving students from many different backgrounds.
Districts may offer different instructional approaches depending on availability of resources,
values of a particular language community, and current research.

Recommendations

      Require parent approval for participation in Title VII programs
      Increase capacity of small districts by providing a separate competition to support
       districts with small but growing LEP populations and those that have not been funded
       before.
      Remove 25% cap on special alternative English programs in Title VII

Increased Accountability for LEP Student Achievement:

Background

Current Accountability Provisions:
      Program evaluation every 2 years in Title VII
      No requirement for annual assessment of English language proficiency
      Title I requires inclusion in State assessment, "to the extent practicable, in the language
       and form most likely to yield accurate and reliable information on what students know
       and can do.'; Title I requires that assessment data be disaggregated by English language
       proficiency status when final assessments are in place.
                                             Ilex-Dump ConvGrsion
Recommendations

ESEA will have a focus on institutional accountability by requiring:

      Annual Assessment of English Language Proficiency
       Both Title I and Title VII will require annual assessments of English language proficiency
       for LEP students.
             Progress on assessments of English language proficiency will be reported--on an
              individual basis--to parents, and results used by administrators and teachers to
              inform instruction.

      Assessment of Achievement to the ReadinglLanguage Arts Standard
            After three years of education in U.S. schools, LEP students would participate in
             readinglLanguage arts assessments in English, without accommodations.
            Title VII will require annual reporting of progress in improving student
             performance, including LEP redesignation (rates oftransitioning to mainstream
             classroom). Grant continuation will be contingent on results.

All Students Learning a Second Language:

Background

      Many other countries encourage or require foreign language education in elementary
       grades. Italy, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Egypt require study of a second
       language by ages 8-9. France, some Canadian provinces, Great Britain, Mexico, .South
       Africa, People=os Republic of China, India, Russia, Israel, Switzerland, Brazil, Japan
       require study of a second language by ages 12-13.

      Title VII Foreign Language grants currently serve over 60,000 students nationally,
       addressing approximately 10 languages at all grade levels (Pre-K Bo 12). Approximately
       20 recipients have implemented two-way bilingual education programs with these funds.
       There are over 200 two-way bilingual education programs in this country. These
       programs, in essence, provide equal status to both languages of instruction, and provide
       instruction that allows all students to truly develop proficiency in two languages.

Recommendations

      Give priority to Title VII programs that develop proficiency in more than one language

      Strengthen capacity-building aspect of foreign language programs by requiring applicants
       to provide plan of how program will be supported after the funding period
                                 SUMMARY


The proposal differentiates between institutional accountability and student accountability.

q      A focus on accountability for results must address: 1) improving training for all teachers
       to better serve LEP students; 2) ongoing assessment of progress in developing English
       language proficiency; 3) assessment of student progress in meeting academic standards;
       and 4) institut~onal accountability for student progress in achieving English language
       proficiency and in meeting the academic standards.

       The goal is that all LEP students will reach English proficiency within three years of
       education in the US.

       o       Under both Title VII and Title I, LEP students would be assessed for English
               proficiency every year. Those results should be used for modifying instruction,
               and to report to parents their child's progress in learning English. In Title VII,
               such results will also be used to determine grant continuation.

       o       LEP students who have been in a US school for less than three years will be
               included in the Title I assessment system to the extent practicable, in the language
               and form most likely to yield information about what these students know and can
               do.
