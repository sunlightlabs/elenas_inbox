RE:           SUMMARY OF HATE CRIME CONFERENCE

DATE:         OCTOBER 16,1997

SUMMARY

        This memo gives you an overview of the White House Conference on Hate Crimes which
will be held on November 10. The Conference is mostly in fine shape, but there are some issues
that need vetting. The legislative options are listed in Section IILD of this memo. The
Department of Justice is coming over for a meeting on Monday, October 20, at 11 a.m. to discuss
which legislative option, if any, to pursue. DOJ would like a firm answer from the White House
as to whether the Administration should pursue a particular legislative option or merely broad
policy principles. When DOJ present the options to the Attorney General, they would like to
brief her on the White House's position.

       As for the format of the Conference, it is expected that the Attorney General will make
opening remarks in the morning, following which remarks the participants would take part in
break-out groups of approximately 30 each. Some of the suggested topics for the break-out
groups are listed below. The topics center around areas such as education, data collection, law
enforcement, and community responses to hate crimes. In the afternoon, the President would
make an announcement regarding hate crimes based on legislative and non-legislative proposals.
 Following or before the President's remarks, one participant from each of the break-out groups
would report back on what was discussed.

        Below is a summary of some of the areas of the conference, including (1) suggested
location; (2) topics of breakout groups; and (3) the President's announcements.

I.     SUGGESTED LOCATION

       The suggested location is George Washington University.


II.    SUGGESTED TOPICS FOR BREAKOUT GROUPS

       There will probably be seven breakout groups with approximately 30 participants each.

        1.    Role of the Schools (K-I2) in preventing and responding to hate crimes

                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

            2.   Role of Colleges and Universities in preventing and responding to hate crimes
            3.   Role of Law Enforcement in responding to hate and bias crimes
            4.   Coordinated Response of Law Enforcement, Victims, and Communities in
                 improving collection of statistics regarding hate crimes
            5.   Hate Crimes in Public and Private Housing: Causes and Prevention Strategies
            6.   Responding to the needs of victims of hate and bias crimes
            7.   Research and Evaluation: What Works in Preventing Hate and Bias Crimes
            8.   Community Responses to hate and bias crimes

III.        PRESIDENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS

       There are basically four main areas in which the Department of Justice is tackling hate
crimes: (1) outreach to the community; (2) statistical collection; (3) educational initiatives; and
(4) possible legislation.

            A.   OUTREACH: HATE CRIMES WORKING GROUPS

                       DOJ is proposing federal-state-Iocal partnerships that would coordinate the
                        prosecution of hate crimes. Members of the working groups would be
                        the U.S. Attorney's offices, the FBI, state and local law enforcement, state
                        and local prosecutors, schools, and advocacy groups. In addition to
                        prosecuting hate crimes, the groups would seek to increase enforcement of
                        hate crime laws, to maximize reporting of hate crimes, and to educate the
                        public about hate crimes.

                       FBI has proposed seeking additional funding in the FY99 budget to add
                        approximately 193 new FBI agents to investigate hate crimes.

            B.   STATISTICS REGARDING HATE CRIMES

                       DOJ is also exploring several possibilities to improve the collection of
                        statistics regarding hate crimes.

            C.   EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES

                       Northeastern University's Center for Criminal Justice Policy Research
                        reports that approximately 65% of violent hate crimes are committed by
                        boys and young men under the age of 20.

                       The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is working with the
                        National Association of Attorneys General to develop a manual that will
                        catalog all of the various resources that are available to assist school
                        administrators and teachers in addressing bias crimes and racial and ethnic


                                                 2
                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
                       tensions in school settings.

                      Middle-school curriculum entitled "Healing the Hate" (already developed
                       by Educational Development Corporation and funded jointly by DO] and
                       Department of Education) should be disseminated to schools.

                      Middle-school curriculum on hate crimes should be placed on the
                       Department of Education's website.

                      Given the statistics that suggest that a large portion of hate crimes are
                       committed by school-age males, DO] could work with Education's
                       National Center for Educational Statistics to explore mechanisms for
                       collecting information on hate-based violence in schools.

                      Elevate awareness of hate-based violence in the educational community
                       through a PSA campaign, conferences, workshops, articles, and the
                       Internet.

        D.     PROPOSED LEGISLATION

        DO] has proposed five legislative options for amending 18 U.S.C.  245, the principal
federal hate crimes statute, to expand federal hate crimes jurisdiction to include bias crimes
committed because of the victims's sexual orientation, disability, and gender.

        Option 1

       Option 1 is the most far-reaching of the five.options. It would add sexual orientation,
        gender, and disability as protected categories. It would require proof of a Commerce
        Clause nexus in the least restrictive manner.

       Concerns about Option 1 are that it would federalize most rapes and would greatly
        increase the federal resources needed to prosecute these hate crimes. The FBI estimates
        that the proposed bill could require $38.5 million per year to hire 219 additional agents.
        However, others at DO] believe that the additional cost to the FBI would be substantially
        less than the estimate.

       Supported by the Civil Rights Division, Office of Policy Development. the Office of
        Intergovernmental Affairs, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Violence Against
        Women Office, and the Office of Victims of Crime.

        Option 2

       Option 2 also would add sexual orientation, gender, and disability as protected activities.

                                                  3
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
    Unlike Option 1, however, Option 2 would require proof of a highly restrictive
    Commerce Clause nexus for hate crimes based on religion, gender, sexual orientation, or
    disability. Specifically, Option 2 would require that the defendant "travel [ed] across a
    State line in connection with the offense." This interstate travel requirement is similar to
    interstate travel requirements contained in the criminal provisions of the Violence
    Against Women Act and in a former version of 18 U.S.C. 247, the religious hate crimes
    statute.

   Option 2 could greatly limit the number of gender-based incidents that would satisfy its
    strict Commerce Clause element. It is possible then that Option 2 could add gender as a
    protected category without overwhelming the resources of the FBI and DOl. However,
    the interstate travel requirement contained in Option 2 likely would have the effect of
    excluding the great majority of bias incidents committed because ofthe victim's sexual
    orientation, gender, or disability.

    Option 3

   Option 3 presents a middle ground between Options 1 and 2. Option 3 would require
    proof of the strict "interstate travel" Commerce Clause nexus for gender-based hate
    crimes, but would require proof of only the broader Commerce Clause nexus of Option 1
    for crimes based on religion, sexual orientation, or disability. The advantage of Option 3
    is that it would give DOl broad jurisdiction over hate crimes based on sexual orientation
    and disability and more limited jurisdiction over hate crimes based on gender, thereby
    avoiding much of the limited resources problem with Option 1.

   One concern of Option 3 is that it would distinguish between treatment of hate crimes
    based.on gender and treatment of hate crimes based on sexual orientation or disability
    without any clear constitutional or policy basis for doing so. Option 3 also probably
    would encounter political opposition from women's groups that want gender added on the
    same terms as other categories.

    Option4A

   Option 4A would add gender, sexual orientation, and disability as protected categories
    and would apply the broad Commerce Clause element from Option 1 to all three
    categories. However, unlike Option 1, Option 4 would attempt to address the resource
    issue by including statutory language requiring proof of gender-based animus, making it
    clear that not every rape or sexual assault was a gender-based hate crime covered by the
    statute.

   Option 4 is controversial in that some groups argue that all rapes have an inherent
    element of gender bias. Furthermore, the exclusion of rapes and other sexual assaults
    that lack additional indicia of gender-based bias may be inconsistent with the federal


                                             4
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

             interest in prosecuting certain gender-based crimes. For instance, a serial rapist, even
             one who rapes in many states, might evade federal prosecution as long as he didn't say or
             do anything that evinced a gender-bias over and above the bias inherent in rapes
             themselves.

            Option 4 might not significantly reduce the FBI's investigative burden as compared to
             Option 1. The FBI might have to investigate to determine whether evidence of animus
             was present.



             Option4B

            Option 4B is the same as Option 4 except that it apply the proof of animus restriction to
             religion, sexual orientation, and disability, as well as gender.

            Supported by the Attorney General's Advisory Committee (comprised ofV.S. Attorneys),
                                   the Executive Office of the United States Attorneys, and the
                                   Federal Bureau ofInvestigation ..

             Option 5

            Option 5 would add sexual orientation and disability as protected categories, but it would
             omit gender-based hate crimes altogether.

            Option 5 would almost surely face even stiffer political opposition than Option 3 or 4.
             The coalition of outside groups is adamant that gender be included. In addition, Senator
             Kennedy's staff has indicated that he will not introduce a bill that does not include
             gender.
            Supported by the Criminal Division.

             Option 6

            Merely support broad policy principles that gender, disability, and sexual orientation
             should be included in an appropriate and constitutional fashion.
