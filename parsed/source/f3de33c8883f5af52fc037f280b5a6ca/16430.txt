                                          on NGA Speech



One year ago, the President signed welfare reform into law because he didn't think governors
should have to ask permission to impose tough work requirements and time limits and provide
incentives to make work pay better than welfare.

As of July 1st, welfare reform has taken effect in all   so states.   Early indications are that so far,
it is working.

There are 3 millin fewer people on welfare than the day President Clinton took office, and a
remarkable 1.2 million fewer since he signed welfare reform into law. This is the largest
decrease in the welfare rolls in history, giving us the lowest percentage of the population on
welfare since 1970.

In Monday's speech, the President will take a hard look at how we are doing -- to highlight
successes and point out shortcomings of states. He will look at how we are doing in five areas:

              Creating jobs that will move people from welfare to work;
              Investing in child care to give women an opportunity to get and keep jobs;
              Making sure people who want to work have adequate transportation to get to
               work;
              Are states using savings to move people into the workforce or diverting them to
               other uses?
              And fifth, are they taking the steps necessary to make sure women and children
               are getting the child support to which they are entitled?

Examples to cite:

Creating Jobs
36 states are doing what the President has encouraged every state to do -- use welfare checks to
subsidize private jobs.

Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are providing employers tax incentives to hire long-term welfare
recipients, something we agreed to do on a national level in the bipartisan budget agreement.

Welfare to Work Partnership led by United Airlines CEO Jerry Greenwald launched May 20th at
the White House, pledged to obtain commitments from over 1,000 companies within six months
to hire people off of welfare.

Child Care

President made sure $4 billion more in federal funds for child care was included in last year's
bill.

About halfthe states are increasing their own spending as well.

Wisconsin, for example, is planning to add $160 million.

Transportation

Kentucky has launched a coordinated effort across four cabinet agencies to ensure transportation
is available.

In Wisconsin, where only 3.5 percent of welfare recipients own cars, the state's "Job Ride"
initiative is vanpooling thousands of central city workers to suburban jobs.

Diverting Welfare Savings for Other Uses

The President will make a strong statement challenging states to use the savings from declining
caseloads to put even more people to work and saying that he thinks the talk in some state
Capitols about diverting funds to other uses in just plain wrong.

Some states are doing the right thing. Maryland has committed to maintain its spending in
welfare reform, pledging to keep its state spending at 100% of historic levels to invest in the
things people need to go from welfare to work.

Child Support Enforcement

The new welfare law included tough new measures to help states track deadbeat parents, such as
new hire reporting, license revocation, centralized collection, and paternity establishment.

States need to pass their own laws to put these new measures in place, but not all states have.
The President will make a strong statement urging governors to work with their legislatures and
get it done.
