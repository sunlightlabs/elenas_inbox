                               TOBACCO MENU OPTIONS

I. Issues

              MENU. What programs should be included on a menu and what percentage
               should be allocated between tobacco / kids?

              STRUCTURE. How should these menu items be defined?

              OFFSETS. How should the $2.9 billion federal share be offset?

II. Menu

Possible proposals include:

      50% Tobacco / 50% Kids. State a broad position allowing latitude in future negotiations
       (Tobacco could include prevention and enforcement as well as farmers; kids could
       include: child care, health (CHIP) and child welfare.)

      Tobacco Control/Farmers / Kids. A broad menu of three items. Non-tobacco
       growing states would not have to spend on farmers.

      Fixed Percentage on Tobacco Control with Menu of other Items. Additional items
       could include:

              Tobacco farmers
              Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Title V program
              Child Care and Development Block Grant
              Child Welfare Programs (Title IV-B)
              SAMHSA grant programs
              Safe and Drug Free Schools program
              CHIP matching funds

Menu Requirements. (1) Funds from the grants may not be used as state match for Federal
programs (except CHIP); (2) there will be a MOE on a program-specific basis; and (3) federal
spending will be netted for amounts spent on federal programs (possible OMB proposal).

III. Structure

Tobacco Control Programs. To be determined is the level of specificity to these programs and
whether farmer assistance is included or is separate to ensure that dedicated monies assist
farmers. Tobacco control programs could be described in broad terms, such as:

       1. Activities for tobacco use prevention and control including community based
       programs similar to programs currently funded by the NIH and assistance to local
       governmental entities to conduct appropriate anti-tobacco activities; and
                                              flex-Dump ConvG,sion
         2. Counter-marketing programs designed to discourage the use of tobacco products by
         individuals, to encourage those who use such products to quit, and to educate the public
         about the hazards of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke implemented through
         contracts or grants to eligible entities.

Or, a more specific menu similar to McCain, which includes:

                 A media based counter advertising campaign to discourage the use of tobacco
                  products;
                 State, community and school-based education and prevention programs to
                  discourage the use of tobacco products;
                 Evidence-based tobacco use cessation programs, consistent with the most recent
                  tobacco use cessation guidelines issued by the Agency for Health Care Policy
                  Research or are approved as safe and effective for tobacco use cessation by the
                  FDA; and
                 Activities to enforce youth access restrictions in order to reduce the sale and
                  distribution of tobacco products to individuals under 18 years of age.

Assistance to Farmers. Legislation could allow states to direct funds to assist tobacco farmers
through:

                 Farmer State Trusts. States could make additional contributions to the Phase II
                  State Trusts recently agreed to by the industry and governors of tobacco growing
                  states. The 11 tobacco growing states will establish separate state trusts with $5
                  billion in industry payments; or
                 Authority to USDA. States could fund a program authorized in legislation, to be
                  designed by the Secretary of USDA, to assist tobacco farmers.

IV. Estimates and Offsets

The Administration's budget assumes that Medicaid costs were the basis for the states' recovery,
whereas CBO assumed that only half of the state settlement funds were attributable to Medicaid.
Moreover, CBO assumed that there is a 25 percent probability that HCFA will successfully
retrieve the funds from the states, while the Administration's budget assumes full recovery. As
a result ofCBO's estimate, any bill that would waive HCFA's ability to recoup the Federal share
in exchange for a commitment by the States to use the Federal share to support shared state and
national priorities would require a $2.9 billion pay-for.

1. Requiring the states to pay $2.9 billion to the federal treasury; or
2. Requiring the states to accept $2.9 billion less in federal block grants; or
3. Increase the excise tax on tobacco products to cover the lost federal share
(HHS is checking whether an excise tax triggers offset provisions contained
in the state settlement).
