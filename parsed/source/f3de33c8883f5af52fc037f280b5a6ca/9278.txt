TEXT:
Here is a modest proposal for a Native American initiative for the Army
Corps of Engineers.   It is a way to institutionalize outreach to Native
Americans at the Army Corps. The Army Corps probably needs to be a little
aggressive in repairing their reputation after the Kenniwick man situation
 (where the Army Corp discovered ancient remains and did not dispose of
them in a way that was satisfactory to tribes or scientists).   We should
add this to our new ideas memo.   Thanks, Mary ==================== ATTACHMENT      1

Create Native American Program at the Army Corps of Engineers. The Army Corps has a
modest $2 million proposal that would institutionalize Native American outreach within the
Army Corps. Here is the proposal:

Outreach ($1.5 million)
      Market engineering, envirorunental, economic, project management, real estate, and
       resource management services to Tribes.
      Using existing workforce of 150 cultural-historical-Tribal specialists for support,
       establish Tribal Coordinators (1 per Corps of Engineers Division, 8 Divisions).
      Establish an Indian Desk in Corps Headquarters to work with Tribes, BIA, Corps districts
       (37) and divisions (8), and other federal agencies to leverage resources/programs.

Training ($250,000)
      Complete consultation guidelines.
      Complete Commander and senior leader video on Tribal matters.
      Develop a strategy for empowering Tribes in the areas of regulatory and natural and
       cultural resource management.

Partnerships ($250,000)
      Explore watershed planning opportunities with Tribes.
      Link to Clean Water Action Plan Activities.
      Develop model MOUs that can be used with Tribal Goverrunents on strategies, protocols,
       and processes for addressing issues.
