              President Clinton: Setting a Tough National Standard for Drunk Driving
                                            March 3, 1998

Announcement
Today, President Clinton: (1) urged the Congress to pass legislation to set a nationwide limit for impaired
driving at .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) for adult drivers; and (2) directed Transportation Secretary
Slater to develop a plan in 45 days to promote the adoption of .08 BAC, including on federal property.

Setting Limits and Saving Lives
       Drunk Driving Kills. Every 30 minutes, someone dies because of a drunk driver. In 1996, of the
        41,907 motor vehicle deaths, 41 % -- or 17,126-- were alcohol-related. Nearly 3,000 of these
        fatalities were young people under age 21. Over 80% of drivers involved in fatal crashes with
        positive BACs had levels exceeding .08 BAC. Moreover, alcohol-related crashes cost society $45
        billion every year, not including the pain and suffering endured by its victims.

       Setting a Nationwide .08 BAC Standard Can Save Lives. A recent study of five states which
        lowered their limit to .08 BAC found drunk driver fatalities were reduced by an average of 16%.
        When all states lower their BAC limits to .08 BAC, alcohol-related deaths are expected to decrease
        by 600 each year.

       Drivers are Impaired at .08 BAC. Reaching .08 BAC is not just a couple of drinks after work.
        An average male weighing 170 pounds must have more than four drinks in an hour on an empty
        stomach to reach .08 BAC. The average I 37-pound female would need to have three drinks in
        the same period. Moreover, at .08 BAC, drivers have difficulty with regard to critical driving tasks,
        such as braking, steering, lane changing and judgment and research indicates that the relative risk
        of being killed in a single vehicle crash at .08 BAC is estimated to be at least II times higher than
        it is for drivers with no alcohol in their system.

Calling for Action to Make .08 BAC the Nationwide Standard
       Making .08 the Legal BAC Limit in All 50 States. The President endorsed the "Safe and Sober
        Streets Act" proposed by Senator Lautenberg and Representative Lowey, which sets a national
        BAC limit of .08 percent for drivers age 21 and older. The bill would give states three years to
        enact laws to make .08 BAC the legal limit, or risk losing highway construction funds. Fifteen
        states have already adopted .08 BAC laws: Utah, Oregon, Maine, California, Vermont, Kansas,
        North Carolina, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Florida, Virginia, Hawaii, Alabama, Idaho and
        Illinois.

       Taking Executive Action on .08 BAC. The President signed a directive to Transportation
        Secretary Slater to work with Federal agencies, States, safety groups, and others, to develop a plan
        to promote the adoption of .08 BAC as a nationwide standard, starting with military bases, Federal
        parks and property. The directive also directs the Secretary to include in his plan an education
        campaign to help the public understand the risks associated with drinking and driving.

A Record of Leadership in the Fight Against Youth Drinking and Driving
      "Zero Tolerance" Laws for Underage Drinking. Calling for action to reduce the deaths and
       injuries brought about by alcohol use and driving by teens, the President signed a law requiring
       states to have "Zero Alcohol Tolerance" laws for youth by Oct. I, 1998 or risk losing highway
       funds. To date, 46 states and the District of Columbia have enacted zero tolerance laws, which
       prohibit youths under age 21 to drive with any measurable amount of alcohol in their system.
