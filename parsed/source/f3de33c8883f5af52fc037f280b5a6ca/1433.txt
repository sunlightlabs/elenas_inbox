Bruce suggested we try       to reschedule the 10:00 Friday HHS meeting re:
bifurcation because of       a conflict with an immigration meeting (see
below). We need to do        the HHS meeting ASAP though -- we can't push it off
for more than a day or       two, I think.

 Elena -- since Cathy is out of the office could Laura try to reschedule
'the meeting at a time that works with Bruce/Elena/HHS schedules and is not
 between 9:30 and 12:00 Friday? Olivia Golden's assistant Arlene
 (401-2337) is the one to coordinate with. Here is the email Cathy sent me
 with the WAVES information for the attendees--       .
