TEXT:
Attached is a memo from Erskine to the strategy team.   The purpose of this
e-mail is to do the following:

further explain Erskine's request for a separate memo on prioritizing the
pillars;
try to frame this mOdifying-your-pillars process;
inform you of deadlines and drop-offs;
provide the modified table of contents (or "table of pillars" which is
attached); and
provide the memo, in case you have not seen it yet (attached).

First off, apologies for the lousy timing of this whole project.  The
first round with the 48-hour deadline was difficult, and this round, while
not as time sensitive, is just as vexing with so many people on vacation.
However, this round should afford some time for groups to work together.

Separate Memo on Prioritizing the Pillars
The third paragraph of EBB's memo requests that each member of the
strategy team individually rank the pillars in order of perceived
importance and briefly describe the reasoning behind their
prioritization. This request is for the core members of the strategy team
to spend some time individually thinking about their recommended vision
for the next three and one half years.   It should stimulate some creative
and thoughtful ideas for moving forward.   These memos will go directly to


Sylvia and Erskine.  I do not think that these memos will be circulated
among the group, but I will follow up on this point later.

Modifying Your Pillars
In modifying your pillars, please pay attention to the third paragraph
regarding timing, prioritizing and costs. While this process may seem not
exactly clear (understatement), I think it is useful keep in mind the
goal: On September 2, we must provide paper to the President which clearly
and succinctly provides the pillars and the choices within them and among
them.  Therefore, in modifying your pillar ask yourself 'How do I
accomplish this with my pillar?' That is, can the President see that my
pillar is prioritized? Is the time for initiating and/or completing a
particular building block clear? Can he see that the cost is already in
the budget or that it requires new spending or reprioritization of budget
funding? etc.

Deadlines & Details
As the memo states, the deadline for pillars and memos is Tuesday, August
26.   Please forward 25 copies of your pillar to me in room 164 OEOB.
Please make the deadline, as it will greatly help the Wednesday's meeting
generally (and your pillar specifically) if the participants have the
afternoon and evening to review the materials. Due to the tight deadlines
of last meeting, we were not able to distribute the pillars before the
first meeting and some of the meeting time was eaten up by the group
reading and deciphering pillars. With vacation schedules, I realize this
will be difficult too.

Modified Table of Contents
The table of contents (attached) was modified by adding campaign finance
reform and merging "Renewal of Families" and "Children."

Thank you.

     focused attention on improving the quality of early childhood programs and
     increasing the number of children being served.  This report highlights the
     major themes and policy implications for implementing Head Start and other
     early childhood programs.  GAO concludes that efforts to improve the quality
     of the Head Start program and expand it to include more children are
     complicated by several factors: the growing numbers and changing
     characteristics of poor children, rising costs of services, and limited
     community resources.

     SUMMARY: Since 1980, at least 8 states and more than 200 localities have been
     delivering a variety of health, social, and educational services to
     students-
     o
     -many of whom are at risk of failing in school or dropping out. These

     approaches, and the circumstances under which each appears most appropriate;

children from birth through age five. In                  Hex-Dump Conversilm ~ . ' '
summary, GAO found that in fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the federal government
funded more than 90 early childhood programs in 11 federal agencies and 20
offices. Of these programs, 34 were key programs-
o
-early childhood programs"for
which early childhood education or child care is the key to the program's
mission. These key programs delivered services to at least two million
children below age five and spent at least $3.66 billion in fiscal year 1992.
However, data are limited on the exact number of children served and the
dollars spent on children below age five. Although these programs have some
similarities, they may target different populations, use different eligibility
criteria, and provide a different mix of services to children and their
families.

-21] Early Childhood Centers: Services to Prepare Children for
School Often
Limited
SUMMARY:More than a third-
o
-2.8 million-
o
-of the nation's children aged three
and
four were from poor families in 1990, a growth of 17 percent since 1980. This
trend continues. These disadvantaged youngster often live in homes that
provide little intellectual stimulation, as well as inadequate health care and
nutrition. Lagging behind their middle- and upper'
o
-income peers when they enter
school, many disadvantaged children never catch up.  Early childhood centers
funded by federal and state government prepare children from school and help
them to overcome their disadvantages.  This report answers the following
questions: What
services do disadvantaged children need to be prepared for,school? To what
extent do these children receive these services from early childhood centers?
