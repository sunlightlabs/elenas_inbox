     Subject:         Fact Sheet: Increasing Trust Between Communities and Law
     Enforcement

     INCREASING TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT:
     COMBATING RACIAL PROFILING
     June 9, 1999

 Today, at a Department of Justice conference, President Clinton will chair
 a roundtable discussion with leaders from civil rights and law enforcement
 organizations on ways to build trust between police and the communities
 they serve. To address the issue of racial profiling, the President will
 direct federal law enforcement agencies to begin collecting and reporting
 data on the race, ethnicity, and gender of the individuals they stop and
 search. The President will also call on Congress to pass legislation to
 promote data collection and reporting by state and local law enforcement
 agencies.

 Getting the Facts on Racial Profiling

 Leading by example. No person should be targeted by law enforcement
 because of the color of his or her skin.  Stopping or searching
 individuals on the basis of race is not consistent with our commitment to
 equal justice under law and is not effective law enforcement policy.
 Racial profiling is simply wrong.  As a necessary step to combat this
 problem, we need to learn the hard facts about when and where it occurs.
 That is why the President will direct the Departments of Justice,
 Treasury, and the Interior to:

 (1) begin collecting data on the race, ethnicity, and gender of
 individuals subject to traffic and pedestrian stops, inspections at
 entries into the U.S., and certain other searches by federal law
 enforcement agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization
 Service, Drug Enforcement Agency, Customs Service, and National Park
 Service; and


(2) after one year, report on the findings of the new data collection
system and make additional recommendations based on those findings on how
to ensure greater fairness in federal law enforcementO,s procedures.

Helping states and localities. The President also will support
legislation introduced by Representative John Conyers (D-MI) to establish
a new federal grant program to assist state and local law enforcement
agencies to implement similar data collection systems.  This legislation
also will authorize the Attorney General to develop a nationwide sample
and issue a report on the number and nature of traffic stops conducted by
state and local enforcement throughout the country.

Surveying the American public. As recently announced by the Attorney
General, the Justice Department this year will amend its National Crime
Victimization Survey and begin asking Americans about their experiences
with traffic stops, police use of force, and police misconduct.  This new
information will help measure our success in building trust and improving
relations between law enforcement and the community.

More Progressive Policing for the 21st Century

Continuing the community policing revolution.   To make our communities
safer and stronger, we must enhance our commitment to community policing.
The 21st Century Policing Initiative contained in the PresidentO,s crime
bill extends his successful community policing initiative and contains
several measures to help strengthen the integrity and ethics of police
forces across the country.   Specifically, his crime bill includes: (1) $20
million to expand police integrity and ethics training; (2) $20 million
for police scholarships to promote the best educated police force
possible; (3) $2 million for improved minority recruitment to help make
sure police departments reflect the diversity of the communities they
represent; (4) $10 million to help police departments purchase more video
cameras to protect both the safety of officers and the rights of the
individuals they stop; and (5) $5 million to establish citizen police
academies to engage community residents in the fight against crime.
