Honorable Newt Gingrich
Speaker of the House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Mr. Speaker:

Enclosed for consideration of the Congress is the "Bilingual Education Act Amendments of
1998," a proposal to amend the Bilingual Education Act to focus it more effectively on the goals
of teaching English to limited English proficient students and assisting those students in meeting
high academic standards. The proposal would also increase the accountability of school districts
receiving grants under the Act to ensure that projects are effective in enabling limited English
proficient students to transfer successfully to regular classrooms within three years. Also
enclosed is a section-by-section analysis summarizing the contents of the bill. I am sending an
identical letter to the President of the Senate.

In the 1995-1996 school year, State educational agencies reported more than three million limited
English proficient students enrolled in school districts in the 50 States and the District of
Columbia. The Federal Government has an important role in working with school districts to
help them improve the quality of instruction for such students. Likewise, the Federal
Government plays an extremely important role in working with institutions of higher education
to train the teaching personnel that schools desperately need to serve limited English proficient
students. The purpose of the "Bilingual Education Act Amendments of 1998" is.to improve the
Federal-local partnership that has existed for nearly 30 years to address the national goal of
preparing recent immigrant and other limited English proficient students to reach the same high
academic standards as all other students.

For the first time, our proposal would establish a goal for every federally funded project of
preparing limited English proficient students to enter regular English language classrooms within
three years. While many projects currently embrace this goal, our amendments would require all
projects to do so. Further, the proposal would require local educational agencies receiving
Federal grants to demonstrate that they are making adequate progress in preparing students to
transfer to regular English language classrooms. Grantees currently eligible for five years of
funding would no longer routinely receive fourth- and fifth-year awards. Instead, decisions on
continued funding would be based on the recipient's first two annual evaluations, as well as any
available data relating to the third year of operation. Further, the Department would reward
projects that demonstrate outstanding progress in preparing students to enter regular English
language classrooms with an extension of up to four years, including funds to disseminate
information and provide technical assistance related to the project's effective techniques.

As an additional accountability measure, if the Department determines that a project is not
making adequate progress, we would require the recipient to submit a corrective action plan in
order to receive a fourth-year continuation grant. One year later, these projects would end if
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

 they could not show evidence of significant improvement. The proposal would also require
 projects to conduct annual assessments of the educational status of individual students. Based
 on the results of those assessments, the school would determine if programmatic changes or extra
 support services for individual students are needed.

  In order to ensure the quality of projects funded under the Federal bilingual education program,
  our proposal would require local projects to complete an annual evaluation of their effectiveness,
  instead of an evaluation every two years. An annual evaluation would allow the Department to
  detect problems earlier and assist school districts in resolving those problems, thus helping to
. ensure positive outcomes for participating students.

  Our bill would also remove the current provision limiting funding for projects that make no use
  of the native language. While I believe that programs using the native language of the students
- are often most effective in teaching these students English and ensuring they do not fall behind in
  other academic areas, the choice of instructional method is best left to the schools and teachers
  that have direct knowledge of the students to be served.

 The proposal would create a funding priority for local educational agencies that have
 implemented accountability systems to ensure that children are successfully transferring to
 regular English classrooms. The proposal also includes a funding priority for professional
 development projects that link individuals who are preparing to become teachers oflimited
 English proficient students with experienced teachers of these students. This priority would
 strengthen the Department's efforts to support the preparation of well-qualified bilingual
 education and English-as-a-second-Ianguage teachers. We also propose to strengthen the
 parental notification and choice provisions ofthe law. As a final change to the Bilingual
 Education Act, the bill would create a new demonstration authority to test innovative,
 research-based approaches for preparing limited English proficient children to enter regular
 English language classrooms within three years.

 I urge the Congress to take prompt and favorable action on this proposal. It would significantly
 strengthen the partnership we have developed over the years with local schools, State educational
 agencies, and institutions of higher education to improve the quality of services for this important
 and growing student population.

 The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the submission of
 this proposal to the Congress and that its adoption would be in accord with the program of the
 President.

                                               Yours sincerely,
