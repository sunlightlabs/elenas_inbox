                 WELFARE REFORM BUDGET IDEAS (October 29, 1998)

Help the Hardest to Employ Move Into Jobs

        There are several ways to expand the Administration's efforts to help those who may face
greater challenges to making a successful transition from welfare to work, including people with
low basic skills, substance abuse problems, and disabilities. We can address these issues both by
refocusing the $3 billion Welfare-to-Work fund and increasing resources through other funding
streams and agencies, as described below.

        In addition, in order to target resources to the hardest to employ, we may wish to amend
the $1.5 billion Welfare-to-Work program during reauthorization to direct more funds to the
highest poverty areas, increase funds for tribes, increase funding for competitive grants, and
encourage assistance for two-parent families (many of whom face issues related to literacy,
substance abuse and disabilities). We are also exploring whether in the TANF program we
could offer additional incentives to the states to invest more of these funds in innovative,
work-focused efforts to help those with substance abuse, low literacy, and disabilities make a
successful transition from welfare to work.

Increase Employment Opportunities for Individuals with Low Literacy Levels

         Historically, individuals with low education levels have remained on welfare longer, and
there is an increasing concentration of individuals with English language barriers on the welfare
rolls in some places.

      Set aside within WTW competitive grant funds for work-based literacy projects. (new policy,
       should not require legislation) Low education level is currently an eligibility criteria for
       WTW funds, and a few competitive grants are focusing on work-based approaches to
       increasing basic skills, for immigrants and other populations. To encourage additional
       services for individuals who need to learn English and other adults with low basic skills,
       we could direct DOL to set aside approximately $100 million of the $375 million
       competitive grant funds for work-based literacy projects.    A high priority should be
       given to projects with strong employer involvement. (Cost: None).

      Create 21st Century Workforce Education Initiative. (new grant idea submitted by ED, not
       currently included in their FY 2000 budget proposal). Barriers preventing more adults
       from participating in Adult Education include time, the need to work, and child care and
       transportation. Providing access to services on or near the work site that complement
       work and are supported by employers would greatly assist individuals to raise their
       literacy levels and succeed in the workplace. Education has proposed grants to help
       support partnerships of business, labor, and education organizations to improve the basic
       literacy skills of current or newly hired workers to meet the demands of a global
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

         economy. These should be closely linked to the One-Stop system created under the
         Workforce Investment Act. While Adult Ed programs are not income-targeted, many of
         those with the lowest literacy levels are poor and either unemployed or working in
         low-wage, part-time jobs. Nearly half are black or Hispanic, and one-quarter are
         immigrants. Adult Ed programs typically require a 25 state match -- we may want to
         allow this match to be met by employers and/or by WTW and TANF funds. [ED is
         refining and costing out the proposal for NEC's E&T meeting on 11/6.]

        Increase funding for Adult Education, induding ESL. There is evidence of large unmet need
         for adult ed services, particularly for ESL in urban areas and for basic education for
         out-of-school youth. ED has proposed a $15 million increase in Adult Ed Basic Grants
         for FY 2000, from $385 million in FY 1999 to $400 million. States provide a 25
         percent match, and decide how much of the Adult Ed funds to use for ESL. ED also
         received $7 million in FY 1999 for ESL discretionary grants, and has proposed a $20
         million expansion in FY 2000. Within the Department's proposed funding level, or with
         additional funds, ED could create incentives for states or communities to expand adult
         basic skills and ESL services to address the long-waiting lists in some areas and also to
         expand capacity of work-focused ESL. (Cost: Need 5 year cost from Ed)

    Increase Employment Opportunities for Individuals with Substance Abuse Problems

         Various estimates show at least 20 percent of welfare recipient have substance abuse
issues, and this percentage rises within those remaining on the rolls. In general, programs that
effectively integrate treatment and welfare to work efforts, and knowledge about how to do so,
are both lacking, although a handful of states have developed innovative approaches.

        Set aside within WTW competitive grants for work-focused substance abuse treatment. (new
         policy, should not require legislation) Substance abuse is one of the eligibility criteria for
         WTW funds and several competitive grants focus specifically on this issue. We could
         direct DOL to set aside approximately $100 million within the competitive grants for
         work-focused substance abuse services.      (Cost: None).

        Support employment-focused substance abuse treatment. States have flexibility within the
         SAMHSA block grant to determine which populations to serve and what kind of
         treatment models to fund. Block grant funding increased significantly in FY 1999 and
         we believe SAMHSA is proposing another significant increase in FY 2000. In order to
         encourage the development of innovative programs that effectively combine treatment and
         work, there is a need for new models, better information about promising practices, and
         better information about available resources that can be tapped to expand capacity
         (including TANF and WTW funds). SAMHSA awards targeted capacity grants to
         communities who demonstrate the need to target specific substance abuse issues. We
         could target a certain portion of these grants to communities who propose work-focused
                                                                  !lax-Dump Conversion

        treatment models, with priority to joint applications from treatment providers and TANF
        or W1W agencies. This initiative would be accompanied by a technical assistance/best
        practices effort for states and communities, jointly funded and managed by DOL,
        SAMHSA and ACF. We are also exploring how to focus prevention efforts on children
        in TANF families. (Cost: grants within current funding levels, $1 million for technical
        assistance) .
Increase Employment Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities

       There are a significant number of things we can do to help people with disabilities who
are on TANF, SSI, or SSDI go to work.

      Set aside within W1W competitive grants for employment services for welfare recipients with
       disabilities. (new policy, should not require legislation) While disability is not a specific
       eligibility criteria for W1W funds, there is a close correlation with other hard-to-serve
       factors. For example, a learning disability may contribute to a poor work history or low
       education level. Several non-profit competitive grantees are focusing on this population,
       and several states have formed good partnerships between their TANF and Vocational
       Rehabilitation services. To attract additional communities and providers to develop
       innovative approaches, we could direct DOL to set aside approximately $100 million in
       competitive grants to help welfare recipients with disabilities get and keep jobs. This
       would be accompanied by an interagency technical assistance effort to improve
       coordination across agencies and programs. (Cost: None)

      New BRIDGE grant program.           In March, you issued an Executive Order directing the
       federal agencies to create a coordinated and aggressive national policy to increae employment
       of adults with disabilities. The "Building Resources for Individuals with Disabilities to Gain
       Employment" ("BRIDGE") program is one of several new proposals to grow out of this
       effort. BRIDGE is a competitive grant program designed to incre.se the employment rate of
       adults with disabilities by fostering integration at the local level of employmentrelated services
       and support services to adults with disabilities. (Cost: $750 million over 5 years)

      Information and Communication Technologies for People with Disabilities. NEC has developed
       draft proposals now being vetted to ensure that new technologies will be designed from the
       beginning to be accessible to people with disabilities. Ideas include leveraging federal
       government procurement, investing in R&D, funding industry consortia, training the next
       generation of engineers (NEC will provide a more detailed write up.)

      Expanding the Defense Department's "CAP" program The Defense Department's Computer
       Accommodations Program ("CAP") purchases equipment for DOD employees with disabilities
       to allows them to keep working if they become disabled, or for new employees just joining the
       workforce. By using a central $2 million fInd for such purchases, individual offices do not
       have to bear the cost within their own budgets, and are less likely to be deterred from hiring a
       person with a disability. Making this program available to other agencies has the strong
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

       support of the Administration's appointees with disabilities, in particular for Tony Coelho,
       chair of the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. (Cost $lQS25
       million over five years).

     Kennedy-JeffordslEmployment-Related Tax Credit. In addition, the
      Kennedy-Jeffords legislation, described in the health section, will playa critical role
      increasing access to health care for people with disabilities returning to work.
Helping New Workers Succeed in the Workforce

Skill Upgrading for Entry Level Workers

        As part of it's FY 2000 budget request, DOL has proposed amending WTW to allow up to
one-third of the WTW funds ($500 million of the $1.5 billion) to be used to upgrade the skills of
entry level workers. Eligible individuals would include former welfare recipients and other low
income individuals who qualify for the EITC, with priority given to certain non-custodial
parents. This initiative would be permissive rather than mandatory -- states could opt to use a
portion of their formula grant for this expanded purpose and population. Employers would be
required to match the federal contribution and commit to hire former welfare recipients for the
positions vacated by the upgraded employees. DOL's proposal would provide access to
upgrade training to a broader range of entry level workers, not just those who have been on
welfare. DOL is currently refining the proposal, but one option is to use $250 million to help
low income/entry level workers upgrade skills so they can move up the career ladder and increase
their earnings, and target the other $250 million for a broader responsible fathers initiative (see
below).

Expand Access to Cars for Individuals Moving from Welfare to Work

        We continue to pursue several small initiatives that would increase access to cars without
having the federal government directly purchase cars for individuals. Possibilities include: 1)
Donate surplus federal vehicles to welfare to work programs who could in turn lease or sell them
to current and former welfare recipients for whom public transit is not a viable option, including
those living in rural areas. This could be modeled after the initiative to donate federal computers
to schools. 2) Identify a modest amount of seed money for a new national intermediary
established to expand the number of community-based revolving loan programs for low income
families to purchase cars ($5 - $10 million).

Welfare to Work Tax Credits

       See Community Empowerment section.

Connection between TANF and Unemployment Insurance.

       While there continues to be substantial interest in this issue, it is probably best considered
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


within the broader context of UI reform. DOL's FY 2000 budget has a placeholder for UI
reform, and OMB is convening a discussion on the issue later this week.

 Additional Welfare-to-Work Housing vouchers.

       See Community Empowerment section.

Full Funding for Tob Access and Reverse Commute Grants.

        The Omnibus Budget Act appropriated $75 million for FY 1999 ($25 million above the
FY 1999 guaranteed funding level). TEA-21 set guaranteed funding from the Highway Trust
Fund at $60 million for FY 2000. DOT has requested $150 million in its FY 2000 budget. We
may also want to pursue a legislative change to the way funds flow to tribal areas -- currently,
states must select tribes as applicants.

Promote Responsible Fatherhood

Responsible Fatherhood Grants

         There is growing interest at all levels of government and across a broad spectrum of
society in helping fathers be responsibly involved in their children's lives through both financial
and emotional support. Increasing the employment and earnings of low income fathers will
increase the financial support they can provide for their children. This support is particularly
critical for children whose custodial parents are moving from welfare to work. These fathers are
generally motivated to work, but they tend to have intermittent, low-paying jobs. They also have
high rates of involvement with the criminal justice system. Employment efforts should therefore
focus on helping these fathers succeed and advance in the formal workforce through a
combination of retention and rapid re-employment services, and work-based skill upgrading.

        We continue to work through a number offunding and scope issues, but one option
would be to designate $250 million from the wrw funds that could be matched by TANF and
child support funds.      Funds could be allocated on a formula basis to states who submit a joint
plan from their TANF, child support, and WTW agencies. This plan would identify a local
service delivery approach that ensured involvement of appropriate local stakeholders, including
community-based organizations. While the primary focus would be employment, funds could
also be used to support parenting, peer support, mediation and other services for fathers who
were participating in work and cooperating with child support. States could propose innovative
modifications to the child support system to remove barriers preventing the system from working
appropriately for this population. We might also consider expanding funding for Access and
Visitation grants for fathers who are 'playing by the rules', i.e. paying their child support
obligations and participating in activities to increase their employment. For equity reasons, it
may be appropriate to allow some level of service to any low income father who is supporting
                                                              llex-Dump Conversion

his children (whether living with them or not), but the primary focus could be non-custodial
fathers (or parents) whose children are current or former TANF recipients.

        Congressman Shaw is expected to reintroduce his Fathers Count block grant proposal
next session and this grant proposal could be a basis for developing a bipartisan initiative. He
proposed $2 billion over 5 years, beginning with $200 million in Year 1, growing $100 million
per year to $500 million in Year 5.

         Other options for expanding the federal focus on low income fathers include: requmng
states to serve a certain proportion of fathers in their formula grant programs or designating a
competitive grant set-aside. We could also broaden WTW eligibility criteria to include any
non-custodial parent of a child on welfare who needs employment assistance in order to meet
their child support responsibilities (currently, the father needs to meet the WTW hard-to-serve
criteria).

        Any fathers initiative should be accompanied by a strong interagency technical assistance
and evaluation component since this is a relatively new field. We could dired HHS and DOL
to identify existing resources, or request approximately $5 million in FY 2000 funding, for: a
how-to guidebook that compiles lessons from past programs, promising practices, and resource
information; electronic clearing house with links to research, existing programs, and resources
with an interactive forum for information; and an 800 number communities can call for
information. It may also be appropriate for DOJ and BUD to participate.

Child Support Law Enforcement Initiative

        This initiative will increase the prosecution of egregious child support violators by
establishing multi-agency investigative teams to identify, analyze, and investigate cases for
prosecution. This investigative effort will result in more cases being referred to the U.S.
Attorney offices ready to prosecute. HHS's Office of Child Support Enforcement, Office of the
Inspector General, and Office of Investigations, working with state and local law enforcement and
child support agencies, have already launched a pilot project in Columbus Ohio, which will
cover 5 states (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio). This proposal would put
these units in place all across the nation within the next several years. Additionally, it would
provide paralegals dedicated to child support cases to the 83 U.S. Attorneys offices that do not
now have them. In July, you signed into law the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, creating
two new categories of felonies for the most egregious child support evaders. (Cost: about $10
million over 5 years).

encourage assistance for two-parent families (many of whom face issues related to literacy,

       from participating in Adult Education include time, the need to work, and child care and
       transportation. Providing access to services on or near the work site that complement

         economy. These should be closely linked to the One-Stop system created under the

         those with the lowest literacy levels are poor and either unemployed or working in

         received $7 million in FY 1999 for ESL discretionary grants, and has proposed a $20

         additional funds, ED could create incentives for states or communities to expand adult
         basic skills and ESL services to address the long-waiting lists in some areas and also to
         expand capacity of work-focused ESL. (Cost: Need 5 year cost from Ed)

    Increase Employment Opportunities for Individuals with Substance Abuse Problems

         Various estimates show at least 20 percent of welfare recipient have substance abuse
issues, and this percentage rises within those remaining on the rolls. In general,. programs that
effectively integrate treatment and welfare to work efforts, and knowledge about how to do so,

         direct DOL to set aside approximately $100 million within the competitive grants for
         work-focused substance abuse services.      (Cost: None).

        Support employment-focused substance abuse treatment. States have flexibility within the
         SAMHSA block grant to determine which populations to serve and what kind of
         treatment models to fund. Block grant funding increased significantly in FY 1999 and
         we believe SAMHSA is proposing another significant increase in FY 2000. In order to

         could target a certain portion of these grants to communities who propose work-focused
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversicn

        treatment models, with priority to joint applications from treatment providers and TANF
        or WTW agencies. This initiative would be accompanied by a technical assistance/best
        practices effort for states and communities, jointly funded and managed by DOL,
        SAMHSA and ACF. We are also exploring how to focus prevention efforts on children
        in TANF families. (Cost: grants within current funding levels, $1 million for technical
        assistance).
Increase Employment Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities

       There are a significant number of things we can do to help people with disabilities who
are on TANF, SSI, or SSDI go to work.

Helping New Workers Succeed in the Workforce

Skill Upgrading for Entry Level Workers

        As part of it's FY 2000 budget request, DOL has proposed amending WTW to allow up to
one-third of the WTW funds ($500 million of the $1.5 billion) to be used to upgrade the skills of
entry level workers. Eligible individuals would include former welfare recipients and other low
income individuals who qualify for the EITe, with priority given to certain non-custodial
parents. This initiative would be permissive rather than mandatory -- states could opt to use a
portion of their formula grant for this expanded purpose and population. Employers would be
required to match the federal contribution and commit to hire former welfare recipients for the
positions vacated by the upgraded employees. DOL's proposal would provide access to
upgrade training to a broader range of entry level workers, not just those who have been on
welfare. DOL is currently refining the proposal, but one option is to use $250 million to help
low income/entry level workers upgrade skills so they can move up the career ladder and increase
their earnings, and target the other $250 million for a broader responsible fathers initiative (see
below).                           .

Expand Access to Cars for Individuals Moving from Welfare to Work

        We continue to pursue several small initiatives that would increase access to cars without
having the federal government directly purchase cars for individuals. Possibilities include: 1)
Donate surplus federal vehicles to welfare to work programs who could in turn lease or sell them
to current and former welfare recipients for whom public transit is not a viable option, including
those living in rural areas. This could be modeled after the initiative to donate federal computers
to schools. 2) Identify a modest amount of seed money for a new national intermediary
established to expand the number of community-based revolving loan programs for low income
families to purchase cars ($5 - $10 million).

Full Funding for Tob Access and Reverse Commute Grants.

        The Omnibus Budget Act appropriated $75 million for FY 1999 ($25 million above the
FY 1999 guaranteed funding level). TEA-21 set guaranteed funding from the Highway Trust
Fund at $60 million for FY 2000. DOT has requested $150 million in its FY 2000 budget. We
may also want to pursue a legislative change to the way funds flow to tribal areas -- currently,
states must select tribes as applicants.

Promote ResponsibJe Fatherhood

Responsible Fatherhood Grants

         There is growing interest at all levels of government and across a broad spectrum of
society in helping fathers be responsibly involved in their children's lives through both financial
and emotional support. Increasing the employment and earnings of low income fathers will
increase the financial support they can provide for their children. This support is particularly
critical for children whose custodial parents are moving from welfare to work. These fathers are
generally motivated to work, but they tend to have intermittent, low-paying jobs. They also have
high rates of involvement with the criminal justice system. Employment efforts should therefore
focus on helping these fathers succeed and advance in the formal workforce through a
combination of retention and rapid re-employment services, and work-based skill upgrading.

        We continue to work through a number offunding and scope issues, but one option
would be to designate $250 million from the WTW funds that could be matched by TANF and
child support funds.      Funds could be allocated on a formula basis to states who submit a joint
plan from their TANF, child support, and WTW agencies. This plan would identify a local
service delivery approach that ensured involvement of appropriate local stakeholders, including
community-based organizations. While the primary focus would be employment, funds could
also be used to support parenting, peer support, mediation and other servicedor fathers who
were participating in work and cooperating with child support. States could propose innovative
modifications to the child support system to remove barriers preventing the system from working
appropriately for this population. We might also consider expanding funding for Access and
Visitation grants for fathers who are 'playing by the rules', i.e. paying their child support
obligations and participating in activities to increase their employment. For equity reasons, it
may be appropriate to allow some level of service to any low income father who is supporting
                                                                   He.x-Dump Conversion


his children (whether living with them or not), but the primary focus could be non-custodial
fathers (or parents) whose children are current or former TANF recipients.

        Congressman Shaw is expected to reintroduce his Fathers Count block grant proposal
next session and this grant proposal could be a basis for developing a bipartisan initiative. He
proposed $2 billion over 5 years, beginning with $200 million in Year 1, growing $100 million
per year to $500 million in Year 5.

         Other options for expanding the federal focus on low income fathers include: requmng
states to serve a certain proportion of fathers in their formula grant programs or designating a
competitive grant set-aside. We could also broaden WTW eligibility criteria to include any
non-custodial parent of a child on welfare who needs employment assistance in order to meet
their child support responsibilities (currently, the father needs to meet the WTW hard-to-serve
criteria).

        Any fathers initiative should be accompanied by a strong interagency technical assistance
and evaluation component since this is a relatively new field. We could direct HHS and DOL
to identify existing resources, or request approximately $5 million in FY 2000 funding, for: a
how-to guidebook that compiles lessons from past programs, promising practices, and resource
information; electronic clearing house with links to research, existing programs, and resources
with an interactive forum for information; and an 800 number communities can call for
information. It may also be appropriate for DOJ and HUD to participate.

Child Support Law Enforcement Initiative

        This initiative will increase the prosecution of egregious child support violators by
establishing multi-agency investigative teams to identify, analyze, and investigate cases for
prosecution. This investigative effort will result in more cases being referred to the U.S.
Attorney offices ready to prosecute. HHS's Office of Child Support Enforcement, Office of the
Inspector General, and Office of Investigations, working with state and local law enforcement and
child support agencies, have already launched a pilot project in Columbus Ohio, which will
cover 5 states (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio). This proposal would put
these units in place all across the nation within the next several years. Additionally, it would
provide paralegals dedicated to child support cases to the 83 U.S. Attorneys offices that do not
now have them. In July, you signed into law the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, creating
two new categories of felonies for the most egregious child support evaders. (Cost: about $10
million over 5 years).
