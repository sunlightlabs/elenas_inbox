TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT BUILDS ON PRESIDENT CLINTON'S AND VICE PRESIDENT
GORE'S SIX-YEAR RECORD OF PROMOTING GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY IN
AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES

Since 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have been committed to tapping the potential of
America's urban and rural communities. They have a demonstrated record of creating new initiatives and
expanding existing initiatives to promote community and economic development. The Clinton-Gore
Administration has worked with the private sector, states, and localities to help revitalize America's
communities by bringing capital, jobs, and opportunity to distressed areas and cleaning up the urban
environment. President Clinton and Vice President Gore have created or expanded the folIowing initiatives
over the last six years:

Helning to Bring Private Enterprise and Capital to Distressed Areas. The Clinton-Gore
Administration has renewed the commitment of the Federal government to help bring private
enterprise into underserved communities and improve access to capital for low-income households,
minorities, and traditionally underserved borrowers.

   125 Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.. The Clinton Administration has
    announced 105 EZs and ECs across the country. This effort was proposed by President Clinton
    and passed by Congress in 1993. The EZ/EC effort has generated more than $2 billion of new
    private sector investment in community development activities. The President has also signed into
    law a second round ofEZs -- 15 new urban and 5 new rural zones -- which will include tax
    incentives, small business expensing, and private activity bonds. In FY 1999, President Clinton and
    Congress provided first-year funding of $55 million for the new EZs, and $5 million in first-year
    funding for 20 new rural Enterprise Communities announced in January.

   Strengthened and Simplified the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). In April 1995, the Clinton
    Administration reformed the CRA regulations to emphasize performance. According to the National
    Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC), the private sector has pledged more than $1 trillion
    going forward in loans to distressed communities - and more than 95 percent of these financial
    commitments have been made since 1992. Banks made $18.6 billion in community development
    loans in 1997 alone. Lending to minority and low-income borrowers is also on the rise.

   Created the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFJ). Proposed and signed into
    law by the President in 1994, the CDFI Fund, through grants, loans, and equity investments, is
    helping to create a network of community development financial institutions in distressed areas
    across the United States. The CDFI fund was established in 1994. In FY99, funding was increased
    19 percent to $95 million from $80 million.

   The Economic Development Initiative and Section 108 Loan Guarantee. EDI grants are used to infuse
    capital into community development projects, enhancing the debt financing provided by the Section
    108 loan guarantee program. Together, the programs support critical economic development in
    distressed communities. Estimated jobs supported by EDI and the Section 108 loan guarantee have
    grown by 300,000 from 1994 to 1998. During this time period ED! and the Section 108 loan
    guarantee program have funded $3.5 billion for more than 650 separate project commitments.

                                                1
.community empowerment agenda is helping to bring jobs and opportunity back to distressed areas:
   $3 Billion Welfare-to- Work Jobs Initiative. The Clinton Administration fought for a $3 billion
    welfare-to-workjobs initiative, as part of the Balanced Budget Agreement. The Administration is
    implementing these welfare-to-work grants directly to both cities and states for allocating
    additional resources to help long-term, hard-to-serve welfare recipients find and keep jobs.

   Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit and Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit,
    enacted in the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement, provides a credit equal to 35 percent of the first
    $10,000 in wages in the first year of employment, and 50 percent ofthe first $10,000 in wages in
    the second year, to encourage the hiring and retention of long-term welfare recipients. This credit
    complements the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which expands eligible businesses to
    include those who hire young adults living in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.
    In FY 1999, the President requested and Congress accepted extending the credit through June 30,
    1999.

   Communitv Development Block Grant (eDBG) Expansion. President Clinton'S FY 2000 budget
    included an expansion ofCDBG. The final budget increases funding for CDBG from $4.750
    billion in FY 1999 to $4.775 billion in FY 2000, a $25 million expansion this year.

Cleaning Up the Urban Enyironment. The Clinton Administration has launched a landmark effort,
including the Brownfields Tax Incentive, to clean up and redevelop Brownfields sites. In total, the
Brownfields action agenda has marshaled funds to clean up and redevelop up to 5,000 properties,
leveraging between $5 billion and $28 billion in private investment and creating and supporting
196,000 jobs.

PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT GORE ARE BUILDING ON THEIR PAST
ACHEIVEMENTS THROUGH A NUMBER OF NEW INITIATIVES THIS YEAR.
While Americans are enjoying the fruits of our strong economy, we still need to do more to improve
conditions in underserved urban and rural communities. To address this need, President Clinton and
Vice President Gore are working on several fronts:

The New Markets Initiatiye. President Clinton's FY 2000 balanced budget provides a new initiative
designed to create the conditions for economic success by prompting approximately $15 billion in new
investment in urban and rural areas through:

   The New Markets Tax Credit. To help spur $6 billion in new equity capital, this tax credit is worth
    up to 25 percent for investments in a wide range ofvehic1es serving these communities, including
    community development banks, venture funds, and the new investment company programs created
    by this initiative (see below). A wide-range of businesses could be financed by these investment
    funds, including small technology firms, inner-city shopping centers, manufacturers with hundreds
    of employees, and retail stores.

   America's Private Investment Companies CAPICs). Just as America's support for the Overseas
    Private Investment Corporation helps promote growth in emerging markets abroad, APICs will
    encourage private investment in this country's untapped markets, by leveraging up to $1.5 bilion in
    investment in new development projects and larger businesses that are expanding or relocating in
    inner city and rural areas.




                                                2
    (SBIC) program has provided roughly $20 billion in equity and debt financing to more than 85,000 ~
    different companies, helping them to grow from small businesses to household names, like AOL I II
    and Staples. However, too little of the capital invested has benefited our cities and rural distresse~ ~
    communities. SBA now will be offering more flexibility and new financing terms for Small            3[
    Business Investment Companies (SBICs) that invest in underserved areas.                             ~~
                                                                                                        o D>

   New Markets Venture Capital (NMVC) Firms. NMVC firms will make both capital and expert !!!. ~   Oro
    guidance available to small business entrepreneurs in inner-city and rural areas. Ten to twenty :s a
    NMVC firms are planned. SBA will match the equity and technical assistance of private investors. ~
                                                                                                             a;
                                                                                                             3
   New Markets Lending Companies (NMLC). For the first time in many years, SBA will approve
    approximately 10 new non-bank lenders _._- firms authorized to originate loans under SBA's largest
    loan program - the 7(a) General Business Loan Guaranty program. Under the 7(a) program, SBA
    guarantees up to 80% of a loan made by a lender to a creditworthy small businesses that cannot
    otherwise secure financing on reasonable terms. Firms must have a strategy to target lending to
    underserved areas.

   Microenterprise Lending and Technical Assistance. Microenterprise initiatives in the FY 2000
    budget include the proposed PRIME Act, under which the CDFI Fund will provide microenterprise
    technical assistance through competitive grants to micro enterprise development organizations that
    focus on low-income entrepreneurs. President Clinton's and Vice President Gore's proposal also
    includes a doubling of support for technical assistance in SBA's Microloan Program and a
    doubling of support for SBA lending to leverage over $75 million in new micro lending. The
    microenterprise strategy will also involve new funding for Individual Development Accounts
    (IDAs) and for SBA's One-Stop Capital Shops.

   Regional Connections. Regional Connections will provide competitive funding to States and
    partnerships oflocal governments to develop and implement new, locally driven "smarter growth"
    strategies that create more livable communities by addressing economic and community
    development needs across jurisdictional lines. Regional Connections, as part of the
    Administrations' Livability Agenda, will complement existing federal programs that respond to
    growth and investment patterns. The budget proposes funding at $50 million in FY 2000.

   The Economic Development Initiative and Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program. This program
    supports critical economic development in distressed communities in conjunction with the Section
    108 loan guarantee program to help bring economic development to residents. In FY 2000 many
    projects will be eligible to participate in the Community Empowerment Fund Trust, a pilot
    program, which will enable the pooling of loans and the creation of a private sector secondary
    market for economic development loans. The CEF specifically targets Welfare-to-Work and City-
    Suburb Business Connections, building upon the success ofHUD's ED! and Section 108 loan
    guarantee program.

   Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. The 2000 Budget proposes mandatory funding
    for ten years: $150 million a year for urban EZs and Strategic Planning Communities; $10 million
    a year for rural EZs; and $5 million a year for rural ECs.

   Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFl) Fund. The budget proposes to expand
    funding for the CDFI Fund to $125 million--a $30 million increase from 1999. The Fund increases
    the availability of credit, investment capital, financial services, and other development services in
    distressed communities.

   Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. Since its creation in 1986, the Low-Income Housing Tax Cre<t ~
    (LIHTC) has given states tax credits of $1.25 per capita to allocate to developers of affordable ~.~
    housing. While building costs have increased 40 percent in the last decade, the amount of the g ~
    credit has not been adjusted for inflation. Therefore, President Clinton and Vice President Gore ~
    propose to increase the cap on the LIHTC from $1.25 per capita to $1.75 per capita -- restoring the~
    value of the credit to its 1986 level and helping to an create additional 150,000-180,000 new low-
    income rental housing units over the next five years.

   Play-bv-the-Rules. This program will allow renters with solid payment track records to own a

   Helping America's Communities Redevelop Abandoned Buildings. Redevelopment of Abandoned
    Buildings, as part of the Administrations' "Livability Agenda," would attack one of the primary
    causes of blight in urban neighborhoods: abandoned apartment buildings, single-family homes,
    warehouses, office buildings, and commercial centers. Under the proposal, HUD will provide $50
    million in competitive grant funds in FY2000 to local governments to support the demolition or
    deconstruction of blighted, abandoned buildings.

"We must do more to bring the spark ofprivate enterprise to every corner ofAmerica -- to build a bridge from
Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, to our Native American communities ... Our greatest
untapped markets are not overseas -- they are right here at home. "
                                                     -- President Clinton, State of the Union Address, I 999

JOINING WITH CORPORATE AMERICA TO MOBILIZE INVESTMENT IN UNTAPPED MARKETS. Today, President
Clinton and Vice President Gore held a roundtable with 17 Chief Executive Officers from major American
corporations and investment firms to discuss ways to best mobilize new private investment in America's most
economically underserved communities --- America's new markets.

ANNOUNCING A PRESIDENTIAL TRIP THE WEEK OF JULY 5 TO UNDERSERVED URBAN ABD RURAL AREAS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. President Clinton announced today that in July he will take a bipartisan delegation of
CEOs and Members of Congress to untapped markets throughout America, touring economically distressed
communities and highlighting new opportunities being created in these communities across the nation.
    The trip will be modeled after the type of trade missions that Cabinet Secretaries and CEOs often take
      overseas to identify markets, which - through trade and commercial agreements - can help to create jobs
      and expand economic development.
    As part ofthe trip, President Clinton will announce new commitments and innovative programs
      developed by companies, community leaders, non-profit organizations and investment firms around the
      country.

PROMOTING EFFORTS TO ATTRACT CAPITAL TO UNDERSERVED AREAS. As part of a bipartisan focus on
underserved urban and rural areas, President Clinton is seeking ways to expand current efforts. President
Clinton's New Markets Initiative will build upon these existing programs and help create the conditions for
economically successful investment in underserved inner city and rural areas. Included among the elements of
the plan are:
     The New Markets Tax Credit. To help spur $6 billion in equity capital for investment in America's
        new markets, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have proposed a tax credit worth 25 percent for
        investments in a wide range of vehicles. Eligible investment companies include community
        development banks, venture funds and corporations, and the new investment company programs created
        by this ini tiati ve.
     America's Private Investment Companies (APICs). Just as America's support for the Overseas
        Private Investment Corporation helps promote growth in emerging markets abroad, APIC will
        encourage private investment in this country's untapped markets. HUD and SBA will guarantee loans
        up to $200 million, creating investment funds as large as $300 million to invest in new development
        projects and larger businesses that are expanding or relocating in inner city and rural areas. Under the
        financing structure, the private investors' funds are at risk ahead ofthe government
     New Markets Venture Capital (NMVC) Firms. NMVC firms will make both capital and expert
        guidance available to small business entrepreneurs in inner-city and rural areas. Ten to twenty NMVC
        firms are planned. SBA will match the equity and technical assistance of private investors.

BUILDING ON SIX YEARS OF WORK TO EXPAND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. The Clinton-Gore Administration
has made community development a priority since taking office. The efforts announced today build on a
number of critical initiatives that have helped to expand economic development to communities across the
country that need it most. These efforts include the Community Reinvestment Act, Community Development
Financial Institutions, Micro-Enterprise Programs, the Economic Development Initiative and Section 108 Loan
Guarantee Program, the Empowerinent Zones and Enterprise Communities, and the Brownfields Tax Incentive.

               21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act Event
                                Questions and Answers
                                    May 12,1999

100,000 COPS

Q:     Today you announced the funding of 100,000 officers. How many of these officers
       are actually on the street? And why the discrepancy between how many are on the
       streets as opposed to how many are funded?

A:    Of the 100,000 officers funded, more than 50,000 officers are already on the beat helping
      to fight crime. The rest will join them shortly: recruiting, screening, hiring and training
      new officers takes between 12-18 months, and many officers we've funded are currently
      in the pipeline.


Q:    Isn't it true that some police departments have misused their COPS funds and not
      used them to hire new officers?

A:    Over 11,300 state and local law enforcement agencies across the country receive COPS
      funding. Only about one percent of these jurisdictions have been found to misspend the
      money, and the COPS Office is working with every local agency to resolve outstanding
      issues to make sure that funds are spent properly. Also, it should be noted that use of a
      portion of COPS money for purposes other than hiring new officers -- such as buying new
      technology to allow current officers to get out on the street -- is completely appropriate.


Q:    How do you know that the COPS Program is actually helping to drive down the
      crime rate?

A:    There is no question that the COPS Program is helping to reduce crime and improve
      public safety across the nation. Numerous police chiefs can attest to the positive impact
      the COPS Program has had in helping them fight crime and bring the violent crime rate
      down to its lowest level in a quarter of a century. Crime is down in all categories and in
      every region of the country. And community members, mayors, and other elected
      officials will tell you the same thing: COPS has made a difference.

      And while the COPS Program is certainly not the sole reason for the drop in our nation's
      crime rate, it has been an important part of our overall crime strategy -- along with
      keeping guns off the street and out of the hands of criminals, tougher punishment for
      hardened criminals, and smarter prevention for our young people to avoid crime in the
      first place.


21st Century Crime Bill
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion



Q:    Can you explain how the President's 21st Century Policing Initiative is different
      from the current COPS Program?

A:    The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program created in the 1994 Crime
      Act authorized $8.8 billion over six years to help communities hire and redeploy 100,000
      officers to our nation's streets and to promote community policing in other ways. To
      date, COPS has awarded over $5.9 billion in grants to more than 11,300 state and local
      law enforcement agencies -- helping to fund more than 100,000 officers. As these
      numbers suggest, for the most part the current COPS program has focused on hiring new
      officers and redeploying veteran officers to the streets.

      The President's bill builds on the success ofthe original COPS program, but it also takes
      a giant step forward by giving law enforcement the tools and partners it needs to keep
      crime coming down well into the 21st Century. First, the 21st Century Policing Initiative
       will help communities to hire, redeploy, and retain police officers. Second, the
      initiative provides significant new funds to give law enforcement access to the latest
      crime-fighting and crime-solving technologies -- improved police communications, crime
      mapping, laptop computers, crime lab improvements, and more. And third, the initiative
      makes an unprecedented commitment to engage the entire community in the hard work of
      preventing and fighting crime -- by funding new community-based prosecutors, and
      partnerships with probation and parole officers, school officials, and faith-based
      organizations.


International Crime/Bioterrorism


Q:    The provisions you are proposing to crack down on bioterrorism sound pretty
      tough. Will implementing these provisions to control dangerous biological agents
      have a "chilling" effect with respect to ongoing research?

A:    While the bill significantly tightens controls over dangerous biological agents to prevent
      them from getting into the wrong hands, it also preserves the scientific community's
      ability to conduct legitimate research with certain biological agents so that we can
      continue to develop new vaccines and more. The President has made scientific research
      to protect against biological and other public health threats a high Administration priority,
      and we will continue to consult with the scientific community on this matter.


Drugs/Zero Tolerance Drug Supervision

Q.    You've talked about a "zero tolerance" policy for prisoners and drugs before, as
      well as requiring states to drug test and treat offenders. What does the' proposal in
      your bill do that is different?
                                                                               Hex-Dump ConversIon


A.    The President's crime bill will take us a step further in accomplishing comprehensive
      testing and treatment for offenders in two significant ways. First, the bill authorizes a
      new $100 million initiative for states to carry out their own plans to test and treat
      prisoners and parolees. And second, these funds can be used, for the first time, to begin
      to test and treat the over 3 million adult probationers -- two-thirds of which have serious
      substance abuse problems.


VictimslElder Crime

Q:    What will the bill do to address nursing home abuse?

A:    The President's bill will provide the Departments of Justice and Health and Human
      Services with new authority to impose civil and criminal penalties on substandard
      nursing home facilities and chains. This includes new criminal sanctions for
      organizations or individuals who knowingly abuse or neglect residents; civil
      penalties that could be imposed on individuals, facility chains, or management
      companies if they harm residents; and new injunctive authority that will allow the
      Federal government to order facility chains and individual nursing homes to put an
      immediate stop to neglectful or abusive behavior.

Q:    Can you cite examples of problems that justify this legislation for nursing homes?

A:    Most nursing homes do an excellent job and provide high quality care to their
      residents. However, recent reports by the General Accounting Office and the HHS
      Office of the Inspector General indicated that almost 25 percent of the nation's
      nursing homes have severe quality infractions that often go unpunished, even
      though the conditions jeopardize the health and safety of residents. For example,
      one nursing home chain was cited for violations in Washington, Maine, Missouri,
      Texas, and California -- and only received a fine. We feel strongly that these new
      actions are necessary to protect the vulnerable elderly who depend on these homes
      for their daily care.


Miscellaneous

Q:    Why aren't there any gun proposals in this bill?

A:    Two weeks ago, the President unveiled his comprehensive gun legislation, the Youth
      Crime Gun Enforcement Act. The President's proposal expands the successful Brady
      Law, extending Brady background checks to all gun show sales, as well as to the
      purchase of explosives. Second, his proposal further restricts youth access to guns
      by raising the age of the current Y9uth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of age, and
      banning youth possession of all semiautomatic assault rifles and large capacity
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

     ammunition clips: And finally, the President's legislation cracks down on illegal
     gun traffickers by limiting handgun sales to no more than one per month per
     person, helping law enforcement to trace more crime guns to their source, and
     creating new tools to go after gun dealers involved in illegal gun trafficking. So,
     while these provisions are technically separate from the crime bill introduced today, the
     President's gun proposal is an important part of his overall anti-crime strategy -- and we
     expect Congress to act on both of these bills.


Q:           The Senate is currently considering juvenile crime legislation. Do you have
     a position on the Senate Republican bill?

A:   The Congress has an historic opportunity to ensure community safety into the 21 5t century
     by continuing and expanding on the successful programs put into place by the 1994
     Crime Act. While we commend the Senate for addressing the important issue of juvenile
     crime, we believe the legislation fails to address a number of other areas critical to
     addressing the overall crime problem. We support a broad-based approach to crime, and
     would support Senate passage ofS. 254 ifit were to provide a more comprehensive
     strategy to fighting and preventing crime, such as common sense measures to keep guns
     out of the hands of kids and criminals, and resources to improve overall public safety
     through more police and community crime prevention efforts -- to deter and combat both
     adult and juvenile crime.


Q:   The Senate Democrats held their own crime bill event earlier today. Are your bills
     similar? Do you support their legislation?

A:   The Senate Democratic crime bill contains many of the same provisions as the President's
     bill, and it certainly emphasizes the same crime-fighting priorities. For example, both
     bills: (1) extend the COPS program; (2) reauthorize a series of successful initiatives from
