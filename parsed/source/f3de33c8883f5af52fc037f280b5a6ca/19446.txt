MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                  Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:               McCain Legislation

We list below several areas in which we should seek changes in the McCain legislation. Note
that FDA jurisdiction does not appear on this list; we were able to reach an agreement on this
issue with Senators McCain and Frist that satisfies all our regulatory needs and objectives.

Youth Lookback Penalties

We already have said that Congress must strengthen the lookback penalties in the McCain
legislation, by incorporating some company-specific penalties and raising the cap on the industry
surcharge. It is possible to fix these shortcomings in a variety of acceptable ways. We would
recommend a company-specific penalty developed by Treasury and HHS, which would impose a
$1000 fee for every child by which a company misses the targets (i.e., if a company misses the
target by 10,000 children, it would pay a fee of $10,000,000). A $1000 per child surcharge is
twice average company yearly profits per smoker. Treasury estimates that this penalty would not
exceed $1 billion a year. At the same time, we should raise the cap on industry-wide penalties
from the current $3.5 billion to $4 to $5 billion.

Price per Pack and Spending

Price per Pack

We recommend waiting until CBO scores the McCain bill before deciding whether to seek any
additional increase in funding levels. (McCain has asked CBO to score his bill by the time
Congress returns.) Congressional scorekeepers may well estimate that the yearly payments in
the bill will increase the price of cigarettes by nearly $1.50 per pack rather than the $1.10 we
estimated. This is because scorekeepers may assume that (1) states will use the opportunity to
increase state excise taxes, further reducing the number of packs sold and (2) the bill will
significantly increase the black market for cigarettes, resulting in fewer than expected packs sold

                                                  1
 these changes would increase the per pack price estimate because the annual industry payment set
 in legislation would be spread among fewer packs. Once we know the actual per-pack price
 increase calculated by Congressional scorekeepers, we will have a better sense of whether the
 public health community and liberal Democrats will push hard for further increases in industry
 payments. In any event, our presumption should be not to demand these increases in the first
 five years, given that the McCain bill adopts our own budget numbers.

 Spending

 We expect bipartisan consensus on much of the spending: $10 billion over 5 years for
 farmers; $10 billion for cessation, counteradvertising, and other public health programs;
 $10-15 billion for NIH; and $20-25 billion for states. One battle will come over how to
 divide up the remaining $15 billion or so. Senate Republicans will seek money for
 Medicare or tax cuts; Democrats will push for everything from child care to school
 construction.

 Another battle will come over the use of the state money. Our budget earmarked 57 percent of
 the state funding for child care, class size, and Medicaid outreach initiatives. As we go forward,
 we should argue at a minimum for a menu of state programs, such as child care and education,
 on which states would have to use a significant portion of their funds. For example, in the
 Harkin-Chafee bill, half of the state funds must be spent on one of 20 listed programs, which
 include child care, K-12 education, Medicaid, the Child Health Insurance Program, and Head
 Start.

 Antitrust Exemption

 The McCain bill contains antitrust exemptions for the tobacco industry that are not necessary to
 achieve the goals of the legislation and may have serious anticompetitive effects. We believe we
 should oppose all antitrust exemptions, except possibly for a very narrowly-drawn one designed
 to allow companies to agree to restrict advertising and marketing to children.

 International Tobacco Control Efforts

  As part of the public health spending noted above, we believe we should include significant
  funding ($200 million a year) for international tobacco control efforts. These funds should be
. spent on both governmental and non-governmental efforts to promote public health and smoking
  prevention efforts abroad.

 The McCain bill has several international provisions that should be amended to ensure that they
 do not interfere with our diplomatic and trade priorities. For example, although we support the


                                                 2
ensure that the language does not interfere with USTR's ability to negotiate tariff reductions or
interfere with treatment of other products. In addition, the McCain bill contains a provision that
  the State Department and HHS consider problematic and unenforceable, which would require
U.S. companies to abide by the new labeling and advertising requirements when doing business
in other countries.
Environmental Tobacco Smoke

The McCain bill would allow individual states to "opt out" of the environmental tobacco smoke
provisions, which ensure that public facilities are smoke free. We should try to eliminate this
opt-out provIsIon. Alternatively, we might consider the Harkin-Chafee approach to this issue,
which would provide funds to States to establish programs to reduce involuntary exposure to
ETS.

 Liability Provisions

We should adhere to the basic structure of the liability provisions in the McCain
legislation. If we need to make these provisions a bit tougher, we can try to raise the cap
from the current $6.5 billion to the $8 billion contained in Harkin-Chafee. We also will
try to determine the effect of changing the ratio of industry payments versus individual
company payments. (McCain has $5.2 billion contributed by the industry, with a $1.3
billion copayment by the companies; Senator Harkin's bill has a $4 billion/$4 billion split.)
Finally, we probably will want to change the provisions related to denying the liability cap
to certain companies. The current provision allows companies that miss the youth
lookback target by more than 20 percentage points to take advantage of the cap as long as
they have not violated the Act or taken action to undermine the achievement of youth
smoking reductions. This provision is likely to have little or no effect; we should either
tighten it or discard it entirely.

Constitutional Issues

We are prepared to recommend changes to the advertising, marketing, and other speech-related
provisions to ensure they are narrowly tailored to meet the government's compelling interest in
protecting children. Provisions regulating non-commercial speech, such as forbidding
companies from lobbying Congress, are problematic and should be removed.




                                                3

In summary, we would recommend seeking these improvements:

Youth Lookback Penalties

       Impose company-specific penalties of $1000 for every child by which a company misses
        the youth smoking reduction targets
       Increase the industry-wide surcharge cap from $3.5 billion to between $4 and $5 billion

Price and Spending

       No change in annual payment amounts in first five years; wait until CBO scores before
        deciding whether to seek later changes
       Ensure spending on research, public health, and farmers; press for spending on child
        care and education, or at least a menu including these programs

Antitrust Exemption

       Eliminate the antitrust exemption

International Tobacco Control

       Support funding for governmental and non-governmental organizations
       Narrow provision prohibiting U.S. support for promotion of tobacco overseas to ensure
        it does not interfere with USTR authority to negotiate treaties
       Remove requirement that companies must abide by new labeling and marketing
        requirements when operating overseas.

Environmental Tobacco Smoke

       Eliminate "opt-out" provision that allows states to adopt weaker laws

Liability

       Retain basic structure of liability priorities
       Consider modifying level of cap, ratio of industry to company payments, and relation to
        youth reduction targets.
