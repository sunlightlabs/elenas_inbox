                           Recent Adminstration Actions
                     regarding Wisconsin W-2 Waiver Requests




DATE           ISSUE           ACTION

Summer/        Food Stamps     USDA approved most of the Food Stamp waivers the state
Fall 1996                      requested for W -2_

Summer/        Welfare         HHS approved Wisconsin's W-2 TANF plan; waiver was
Fall 1996                      no longer needed (see attached summary)_

Summer/        Medicaid        HHS denied Wisconsin's W-2 Medicaid waiver proposal,
Fall 1996      Block Grant     because, as the President stated in a 12/13 letter to the
                               state, "it violated my Administration's commitment to
                               maintaining a federal guarantee of health care for
                               low-income individuals."

May 1997       Food Stamp      USDA responded to the Wisconsin Department of
               Privatization   Workforce Development saying the state's Food Stamp
                               privatization waiver request submitted in May 1996
                               "remains under review.... privatization has far-reaching
                               impacts and requires an earnest review and evaluation."

June 1997      Medicaid        HCFA's regional office wrote to the state saying the
               Privatization   state's proposal was likely not approvable "because it
                               seems to allow non-public employees to perform activities
                               in the eligibility determination process that are not
                               authorized by the statute or outstationing regulation" and
                               requesting more information.
September      Children's      The state submitted a concept paper to HCFA regarding an
1997           Health &        integrated 1115 waiver of provisions of both Medicaid the
               Medicaid        new children's health program (see attached summary).
October-Dece   Children'S      HCFA has had several conference calls with state officials
mber 1997      Health &        since early November and is planning another conference
               Medicaid        call with the state during the week of 12/8.
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

                       Wisconsin's Medicaid and Children's Health Waiver


  Wisconsin has indicated its strong interest in getting an 1115 waiver to the Children'S Health
  Insurance Program (CHIP). On September 30, they sent a "concept paper" to HCF A on their
  ideas and have subsequently sent a set of bullets describing more details of their proposal.
  HCFA staff have had informal contact with the State Medicaid Director, Peggy Bartel. HCFA is
. planning a conference call with state officials next week.


 Summary of "BadgerCare" -

         Combination of CHIP and Medicaid 1115: Proposes to have a single program for
          families up to .185 percent of poverty and people transitioning from welfare to work

         CHIP funding: The state would get the enhanced matching rate and draw down from its
          allotment for all children plus adults up to 133 percent of poverty (if there is enough in
          the state's allotment). Medicaid would fund adults above 133 percent of poverty.

         Benefits: Medicaid

         Cost sharing: Families above 143 percent of poverty would pay premiums equal to 3.5
          percent of family income.


 Issues

         Administration's general concern about 1115 waivers for Title XXI: Nancy Arm Min
          said back in September that we are reluctant to consider 1115 waivers until we have more
          experience with the program. We are right now preparing a memo to the President on
          whether we should formalize this position.

         Specific issues that require waivers:

                 Enhanced matching rate / Title XXI funds for parents, not just kids

                 Coverage of children who hav,e partial insurance or access to insurance

                 Use of premium revenues as the state contribution

                 Cost sharing below the income level specified in legislation (143% v 150%)

                 Privatization of eligibility determination: There are no rules against privatization
                 in CHIP but there are in Medicaid. The state wants to allow eligibility
                 determination by non-governmental agencies.

                           Background on Wisconsin Works (W-2)


The Wisconsin Works welfare reform program, also known as W -2, contains these key elements:

Everyone works: Effective 9/1/97, W-2 replaced welfare in Wisconsin. Everyone must do some
kind of work, and cash is based on participation in work. There is no entitlement to assistance,
but there is "a place for everyone who is willing to work to their ability." The program is
available to all parents with minor parents, low assets and low income.

Self-Sufficiency Ladder: W-2 includes four kinds of work ranging from unsubsidized
employment to W-2 Transitions depending on someone's ability (see attachment). It might be
interesting to ask about the relative priority and utilization of these four activities.

New role for staff: Wisconsin has replaced eligibility workers and case managers with "financial
and employment planners" who focus on self-sufficiency and responsibility. The FEPs are
available to help people once they've entered unsubsidized employment.

Investment in support services and retention: Wisconsin has invested heavily in support services
to help people transition from welfare to work and to help families maintain employment.
Governor Thompson has been very vocal about the importance of investing in child care. All low
income. families below 165% of poverty are eligible for child care subsidies on a sliding fee
basis, regardless of whether they have been on welfare. W -2 agencies may provide
post-employment services including job coaches, training, education, and transportation to help
someone succeed on the job.

One-Stop Job Centers: These are the single point of entry for employers and job seekers--W-2
participants as well as others. The state has entered into a contract with a W -2 agency for each
county, with the exception of Milwaukee which has 5 contractors (see attached). In most places,
the county is the W-2 agency; in Milwaukee, the W-2 contractors include private for profit and
non-profit entities.

Eamed Income Credit: W~sconsin is a strong advocate of the EIC, including the Advance EIC
option (where employees get a portion of their EIC in each paycheck). The state is also one of
four to have a refundable state EIC.
