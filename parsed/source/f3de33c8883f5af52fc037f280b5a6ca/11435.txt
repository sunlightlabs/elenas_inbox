the SAFE Act, a proposal to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.                      I

appreciate the opportunity to express OSHA's views on this bill. I would also like to take this

opportunity to express my appreciation to you, Mr. Chainnan, for your efforts to find common

ground on these important issues. Although you have modified your proposal, the Department

remains unable to support your bill.



OSHA Works

OSHA's core mission is to ensure a safe and healthy workplace for every working man and

woman in the Nation.       We are most pleased by the latest occupational injury and illness

statistics. For the fifth consecutive year the rate of injuries and illness declined. In fact, the rate

for 1997 was the lowest since the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) began reporting this

infonnation in the early 1970s.        The improvement is particularly impressive in a booming

economy when many new and inexperienced workers are coming into the workforce.

Historically, new employees have been more likely to get hurt on the job than more experienced

workers. Much of the credit for the improvement can be attributed to millions of employers and

employees working every day to eliminate on·the-job hazards. I am proud that OSHA has been
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

a catalyst to help these private sector efforts, using results-driven enforcement efforts,

compliance assistance and standard setting to bring about workplace improvements.



Many challenges remain, but this message is clear. The New OSHA works. In the 4 years

since President Clinton announced the "New OSHA" initiative, which combines targeted

enforcement with partnerships and compliance assistance, we have' developed a broad range of

successful partnership programs.     The New OSHA is doing more to promote cooperative

partnership efforts between employers, workers and government.

       OSHA joined with industry last November to hold a partnership conference celebrating

the positive impact strategic partnerships, the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition

Program (SHARP) and the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) have on protecting employees

and lowering workers' compensation costs for employers. In one success highlighted during the

conference, OSHA worked with the Steel Erectors' Safety Association of Colorado (SESAC) to

change a historically adversarial relationship into an effective partnership.. According to the

president of Ridge Erectors, a SESAC participant, the partnership has "effectively taken an

adversarial position that's been historic between business and OSHA and turned it into a

partnership agreement where we work together to enhance education and we work together to

provide a safe workplace." Many of the SESAC members have reduced injuries and illnesses at

their workplaces and have lowered their workers' compensation costs. Calc on Constructors, for

example, reduced their workers' compensation rate by almost two-thirds (saving sixty-three cents

on every dollar in workers' compensation costs) as a result of its partnership with OSHA.

                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


Another successful partnership is happening in Port Arthur, Texas where the Huntsman

Petrochemical Aromatics and Ole fins Plant is a member of OSHA's Voluntary Protection

Programs (VPP). Workers at this site have repeatedly credited VPP participation as one vital

factor contributing to improved management and employee relations.          The plant's current

three-year injury incidnence rate is 74 percent below the industry average and its lost workday

rate is 99 percent below average.



Many companies are commenting that their impression of OSHA has changed. In one example,

an employer in OSHA's Maine 200 program said, "When I have a question for OSHA, I'll call

them." He said that when other agencies call him, "I'll call my lawyers first[.]" Similarly, in

New Jersey, the head of Barnard Construction said, "I think OSHA is trying to get on a path of

not just knocking people out of business, but educating them." He went on to add, "Their

attitude has definitely changed." Comments like these demonstrate OSHA is making progress.



In addition to partnership efforts, OSHA is making enforcement programs smarter and fairer by

spending more time at the most hazardous workplaces and less time at safer ones. OSHA is

using BLS data to identify industries with the highest injury and illness rates and is using

information gathered from our own Data Initiative to target inspections at specific workplaces.

In doing so, we have been able to discover serious violators in less time. At the same time,

employers whose attention to safety has already paid off in the form of lower injury and illness

rates are less likely to see an OSHA inspector.




                                                  3
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

Over the past several years, we also have measured results, where possible, not by numbers of

citations or penalties, but by real improvements in the lives of working people, such as reduced

injury and illness rates. The five-year decline in injury and illness rates is evidence that this

combination of approaches is working.



Finally, OSHA has redoubled its commitment to small business. Immediately after I leave this

hearing, I will be participating in a forum that OSHA is holding, entitled "OSHA and Small

Business: New Ways of Working." The forum will showcase information and services available

to help small businesses improve workplace safety and health.      The program will involve a

half-day seminar and a question-and-answer session with a panel of OSHA senior staff. We will

cover several topics, including how small businesses can receive compliance assistance and

technical advice, the role of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act, and

partnership opportunities.



The SAFE Act

Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate your cooperative spirit and hope that we can continue to work

together to improve worker safety and health, OSHA cannot support the legislation before the

Subcommittee today. Last year, the Department stated its intent to recommend a veto if the

SAFE Act passed the Congress.       Despite the changes that have been made since then, we

believe the new SAFE Act, if enacted, would undermine the agency's ability to protect workers.

Consequently, if S. 385 were passed, as written, the Department would recommend a veto.




                                               4
Third Party Consultation                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

S. 385 would establish a new system for OSHA to certify private-sector, for-profit, third party

consultants. Consultants would contract with employers and provide them with a certificate that

would exempt them from OSHA civil penalties for one year.



OSHA opposes the third party consultation provision. First, OSHA strongly disagrees with the

opinions stated in the new "Purpose" section, which we believe are wholly inappropriate and

inaccurate.   Second, the provision creates conflict-of-interest and accountability problems.

Finally, we are concerned that employers could, in effect, negotiate compliance agreements that

fail to meet the requirements of the OSH Act.



Pumose

The seemingly iqnocuous "Purpose" section of the third party consultation provision could

cripple the agency.     This section would codify the erroneous opinion that employers are

incapable of compliance with OSHA regulations and that OSHA is unable to enforce them.

Some employers would attempt to use this provision to avoid compliance. While we strongly

agree that employee safety and health are "of paramount concern," subsections two and three of

this section would undermine that spirit.



Conflicts of Interest

Private safety and health consultants provide an important service and OSHA encourages

employers to use them as a valuable resource. OSHA also provides free consultation for small


                                                5
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
businesses in each of the fifty states, the District of Columbia and three territories. However,

there are significant differences between employers using consultants voluntarily to self-inspect

and using them to purchase immunity from OSHA penalties.              While OSHA encourages

employers to make use of non-OSHA consultants, the private sector is driven by the market, not

a mandate to protect employee safety and health. Therefore, the program would be vulnerable to

conflict of interest and accountability problems.



The third party consultation provision creates a powerful incentive for consultants to please

employers in order to create and maintain business.       The consultant's business interest in

conducting inspections and granting penalty exemptions could place him or her at odds with the

interests of employee safety and health.      This tension could ultimately cast doubt on the

legitimacy of the exemptions the consultant grants. The consultant would feel pressured to sell

penalty exemptions without rigorously inspecting workplaces in order to create business.

Likewise, employers may feel obligated to purchase unnecessary services in order to curry favor

with the consultant.



Accountability

The bill provides OSHA with little recourse against consultants whose improper certifications

put workers at risk. Under this provision, the only option OSHA would have for dealing with

consultants who commit fraud, collusion, malfeasance or gross negligence would be to expel

them from the program.      Such serious offences warrant more than mere removal from the

program.    Worse yet, OSHA would have no meaningful recourse against a consultant who was


                                                    6
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

overly generous in granting penalty exemptions due to incompetence or negligence.             Even

though workers would continue to be exposed to hazards in the workplace, the consultant could

continue to grant exemptions and the certificates of compliance he or she issued would stilI

stand. If, on the other hand, OSHA finds that one of its compliance officers is not performing to

our standards, we have the ability to correct the situation. The disciplinary provisions of this

program are simply insufficient to redress the harm consultants could inflict on thousands of

working Americans.



Employer- Negotiated Compliance

Section 3 would allow an employer whose workplace was found to have safety and health

hazards to negotiate compliance efforts and requirements with the consultant. The provision

requires that the employer and consultant agree to the terms and timeframes of the Action Plan.

Agreements necessitate compromise.      It is entirely possible that, under the language of this

legislation, an employer and consultant would agree to an Action Plan in which the employer is

not required to come into full compliance with the OSH Act for many years. For example, an

employer and consultant may compromise·on how quickly a guardrail must be fixed although

employees would remain exposed to a significant fall hazard in the meantime. OSHA cannot

support legislation that would allow an employer to avoid compliance and endanger workers.



Safety and Health Programs

OSHA is pleased that the new bill emphasizes the importance of safety and health programs by

including many elements of OSHA's         SHARP program.       However, this change does not


                                               7
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
overcome OSHA's significant objections to the third party consultation provision.




The bill encourages employers to use third party consultants by offering them a one-year

moratorium on penalties for violations of the law.   We strongly disagree with this approach.      If

employers, acting in good faith, engage qualified consultants and correct all of the violations the

consultants find, they should have no reason to be concerned about penalties and fines.            A

penalty waiver will be an incentive only to an employer who does not intend to put an effective

safety program in place and who does not intend to correct all violations.           The SHARP

program, on which section 3 is modeled, does not offer a penalty waiver.                 Rather, in

recognition of the fact that the participating employer has received significant attention from

OSHA, SHARP provides for a one-year exemption from programmed inspections.                        If,

however, OSHA is called in for a complaint or fatality investigation and discovers uncorrected

violations, the SHARP employer will be subject to citation and penalties.            I believe that

employers will be less likely to comply with the law if we tell them in advance that they may

violate the law without fear of a penalty. In addition, the proposal in S. 385 would allow a

company with an injury and illness rate twice the average for its industry to receive a certificate

of compliance and the resulting penalty exemption.



I would like to take this opportunity to highlight several of OSHA's other concerns with         the

SAFE Act.    I will limit my comments to a few provisions that I find particularly troubling.

Among these are the technical assistance, worksite-specific compliance, and discretionary


                                                8
                                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

compliance assistance      provIsions.   My limited discussion of these few provisions of the bill,

should not be taken to imply that OSHA supports the remainder of the bill.             But    10   the

interest of time, I will   forgo commenting on those issues in my testimony.     The Department's

comprehensive analysis of the bill is attached to my testimony.




Technical Assistance

Section 8 would amend the recently enacted provIsions that govern OSHA's consultation

program.       Just months ago, OSHA supported enactment of H.R. 2864, a bipartisan bill

sponsored by Congressman Cass Ballenger of North Carolina, that codified OSHA's consultation

program with enhanced employee protections.        We are proud that our cooperative efforts added

OSHA consultation to the Act.        We believe that no amendments to the new law are needed at

this time.     The fee-for-service element of S. 385 would give priority to those who can afford to

pay for      consultation, not those who need it most.        Consultation is and should remain

prioritized for small, high-hazard employers, not for large, wealthy ones.




Worksite-Specijic Compliance

.section 7 would require citations to be vacated if the employer can prove that its employees were

protected "by equally or more protective" means than those required by OSHA standards.

This new employer defense could turn every enforcement action into a time-consuming standards

litigation effort, imposing substantial burdens on agency resources· and the court system. OSHA

standards would become mere guidelines open for debate whenever an employer wants to contest

                                                   9
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
OSHA standards, and routine enforcement cases would be turned into exercises in rulemaking.

For this and other reasons, courts have held repeatedly that employers must comply with OSHA

standards in the manner specified in the standards. As the United States Court of Appeals for

the Eleventh Circuit has noted, "An employer must folIow the law even if it has a good faith

belief that its own policy is wiser."



Discretionary Compliance Assistance

Section 11 would alIow OSHA to issue warnings in lieu of citations, even for violations that have

killed employees, as long as the employer agrees to abate the violation promptly. This section is

unnecessary and could lead to reductions in employer compliance with the law. OSHA already

has the discretion to decline to issue citations in appropriate circumstances.      For example,

OSHA has used this discretion to establish programs such as Maine 200.        In addition, OSHA

has created a "quick fix" policy in which a compliance officer does not issue citations where the

employer immediately abates a hazard that was not likely to cause harm to an employee.



This provision sends a message that employers need not necessarily concern themselves with

potential OSHA fines for violating its law. If employers believe that OSHA's enforcement

ability is weakened, they will be less likely to comply with OSHA standards.           Further, if

employers believe they get one free pass before receiving a penalty, many could be lulled into

complacency regarding safety and health requirements until finalIy being inspected.          This

provision is particularly troubling because it could actually influence employers not to remain in

compliance with the OSH Act.

When I evaluate legislative proposals to amend the OSH Act, my first question is always the

same: will the change tend to make workers safer and healthier? There is no doubt in my mind

that a provision that removes an important incentive for employers to comply with the law fails

that simple test.



Mr. Chairman, I believe you have made a good faith effort to improve upon last year's version

of the SAFE Act by eliminating certain controversial provisions. Unfortunately, the remaining

provisions continue to raise serious concerns that would necessitate a veto recommendation by

the Secretary of Labor.



Protecting Workers Better




Mr. Chairman, there are a variety of ways to strengthen the protection provided to workers

under the OSH Act.        We would, for example, support legislation that strengthens the

whistleblower protection of the OSH Act. It is fundamental that workers must feel free to

inform their employer or the government when dangerous working conditions threaten their life

or safety. There is a good deal of evidence, however, that many employees do not feel free to

complain about unsafe conditions and that too many employers feel they can retaliate against

whistleblowers with impunity. The provisions in place today in section 11 (c) of the Act are too

weak and too cumbersome to discourage employer retaliation or to provide an effective remedy

for the victims of retaliation. A recent report by the Inspector General of the Department of

                                              11
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

Labor found that "whistleblowers" frequently face retaliation for exposing unsafe or unhealthy

working conditions. A nurse at Skyline Terrace Nursing Home, for example, complained about

the home's lack of gloves, which are required to protect employees from bloodborne pathogens.

Four days after an inspection, she was fired in retaliation for the complaint. Another company,

Hahner, Foreman & Harness, Inc., fired an employee for refusing to go up in a gondola three or

four stories above the ground. The gondola had been malfunctioning and the employee believed

it to be unsafe. When the employee refused to risk his safety, his superintendent instructed him

that if he did not go back up into the malfunctioning gondola, somebody else would. He was

fired for his refusal. If you wish to strengthen the safety and health protection available to

workers, I suggest this .as a place to begin.



In 1993, the North Carolina legislature, in a comprehensive review of our State plan following

the Hamlet fire, took several steps that greatly strengthened whistleblower protection. The

changes included a longer statute of limitations, a private right of action and a provision for

treble damages. I believe these changes have played an important part in the progress North

Carolina has made in reducing injury, illness and fatality rates over the last five years.



A second area this Subcommittee may want to consider is protections for public employees.

The OSH Act currently does not effectively protect Federal employees and, in states that do not

operate an OSHA-approved State plan, does not protect state and local employees (maintenance

workers, construction workers, firefighters, etc.).    Consequently, with the exception of the 25

states that actively provide public sector coverage under State OSHA programs, OSHA has little

                                                  12
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion .

ability to require positive change on the part of public employers.          As a consequence, this

limited authority hinders OSHA's success in reducing illness, injuries and fatalities on the job.

Congress last year enacted legislation supported by the Chairman and the Administration to

subject the U.S. Postal Service to OSHA penalties.       Experience with this new requirement has

shown that future action in expanding OSHA protections is not only feasible but advisable.




There are numerous examples of on-the-job tragedies that occurred primarily because safety and

health protections do not apply to public employees.            These tragedies could have been

prevented by compliance with OSHA rules.           In addition, studies have shown that the overall

cost of providing OSH Act coverage for these employees is small, especially compared with the

amount of money which would be saved by reducing the cost of worker injuries.




Finally, the Subcommittee should increase the criminal penalty for an employer whose willful

conduct causes the death of an employee.      We would urge that these violations not be classified

as misdemeanors, but felonies, which carry with them the possibility of incarceration for periods

in excess of one year.   Classifying willful workplace safety and health violations that lead to an

employee's death as misdemeanors is woefully inadequate to address the harm caused.

Classifying such crimes as felonies would more justly reflect the severity of the offense.




Condusion

While OSHA appreciates the Chairman's attempts to Improve this bill, those attempts have not

overcome OSHA's opposition to the SAFE Act. By diminishing OSHA's enforcement authority,

 the bill weakens worker safety and health. We believe the Subcommittee's efforts would be

better directed toward efforts on which a consensus is possible. Such discussion can most

effectively help achieve our mandated goal of safer and healthier workplaces.

                                DRAFT-      ANALYSIS OF S. 385

Section 3. Third Party Consultation Services Program

Section 3 requires the Secretary to establish a program to "qualify" individuals who could then
serve as consultants to employers to assist them in identifying and correcting safety and health
hazards in their workplaces. An employer who contracted and received such services and who
was declared by the consultant, after the initial visit to the workplace, agreement on an Action
Plan, and a possible follow-up "reinspection" visit, to be in compliance with the Act, would be
exempt from any assessment of a civil penalty under the Act for a period of one year, with certain
limited exceptions.

The Department of Labor strongly opposes this section. While the proposal presents numerous
problems, the Department is most concerned about the one-year exemption that the bill would
provide from civil penalties for violations of the OSH Act.

The incentives created by coupling the third party consultation provision with a penalty
exemption leave the program extremely vulnerable to conflict-of-interest and accountability
problems. At the most obvious level, a consultant paid by an employer would be likely to feel
pressured to approve the employer's program or to fail to recommend costly engineering controls
even when they were necessary to prevent an injury or illness. Likewise, businesses may feel
obligated to purchase unnecessary services proposed to them by their consultant in order to
ensure being granted a certificate of compliance. In addition, the provision permitting
employers and consultants to agree upon the terms of the Action Plan would invite abuses that
could result in seriously delayed abatement, if abatement is agreed to at all. Further, there is no
provision in the bill that would prevent an employer from utilizing one of its own employees, or
a former employee, to provide consulting services. Though this is no doubt not the intent of the
bill's authors, section 3 would in effect enable employers to "purchase" immunity from OSHA
inspections and penalties.

Reliance on the private sector for in-compliance declarations, coupled with exemptions from the
possibility of an OSHA inspection with penalties for employers who receive such declarations,
would leave the agency without sufficient recourse if an inspection is necessary within the
exemption period. For example, even if conditions in a certified workplace had undergone
major change during the exemption period, a penalty could only be levied if OSHA could
demonstrate the occurrence of a "fundamental change in the hazards" of the workplace or that the
employer had not made a good faith effort to remain in compliance. The only large-scale study
to date that correlates worksite injury data with worksite inspection history over time has shown
that inspections in which penalties are assessed result in a significant reduction in injuries at the
inspected site for three years following the inspection, and that inspections without penalties
have no appreciable impact (Wayne Gray and John Scholz, "Does Regulatory Enforcement
Work? A Panel Analysis of OSHA Enforcement," Law and Society Review, pages 177-213 (July
1993)).


                                                 15
                                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
The new version of the SAFE Act has been modified to include a safety and health program
component. This is a positive addition to the bill, but does not cure flaws inherent in the third
party consultation proposal. OSHA's Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program
(SHARP), part of OSHA's consultation program, exempts employers from aprogrammed
inspection only after the employer requests and receives a full-service consultation visit, and
works with the consultation program for a period of at least a year from the date of the initial
visit to correct and abate all hazards, implement a fully effective worksite safety and health
program and lower the lost workday and accident rates to a level at or below the national average
for their industry. Unlike S.1237 in the 105 th Congress, S. 385 incorporates a requirement for
employers to implement a safety and health program before they can receive a certificate of
compliance. However, unlike OSHA's SHARP program, there is no guarantee that all hazards
will be abated before a certificate is granted. In addition, the ability of private, for-profit
consultants to provide penalty exemptions, rather than the exemptions from programmed
inspections that the SHARP program provides, gives those private, for-profit consultants power
well beyond any power granted to an OSHA compliance officer or a state consultant. SHARP
companies never receive blanket exemptions from penalties. Finally, under the SHARP
program, OSHA has the final say over whether companies should receive SHARP recognition.
This system provides an additional check to ensure that a workplace is safe and has an effective
safety and health program before it becomes exempt from a programmed inspection.

The Department remains concerned that the bill is completely silent about a consultant's
obligations when an employer is found NOT to be in compliance. This means that the
consultant then has the option of refusing to provide a declaration, which leaves the employer
free to seek out another consultant. While the bill now requires the consultant to identify
violations of the OSH Act and possible corrective measures, there is still no clear requirement
that employers abate the identified hazards or that consultants report to OSHA in the event of an
employer's refusal to abate. Moreover, because reinspections are not necessarily required, there
is no way for the consultant, employees or OSHA to verify either abatement or whether the
elements of an effective safety and health program have been fully implemented.

The Department is concerned that the bill could allow an employer to receive a certificate of
compliance even ifit has not yet completed the process of hazard abatement. This would allow
an employer that is out of compliance with the law to be declared in compliance. The problem
is further compounded because an employer with a certificate of compliance who has not yet
abated hazards identified in the written plan could not be penalized by OSHA for one year.
Finally, unlike OSHA's abatement verification rule, the employer would not have to "inform
affected employees and their representatives about abatement activities" the employer had
promised to undertake. Elimination of a mandatory reinspection requirement augments this
problem. Without reinspection, an employer could obtain a certificate without having to show
that it has abated a single hazard. In the event that a reinspection does actually occur, there is no
provision for further action if the employer has not satisfied all the elements in the consultation
report.



                                                   16
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

In addition, relying on the private sector for such certifications, while at the same time exempting
the employer's worksite from the possibility of a penalty, would deprive the agency of sufficient
"quality control" over both certifications and the safety and health audits perfonned by federally
sanctioned, certified individuals. The only oversight granted to OSHA under this bill is
meaningless. The bill requires OSHA to maintain a registry of safety and health consultants it
deems qualified, but hamstrings the agency in the event problems occur. In addition,
maintaining a registry would place a substantial burden on the agency's already limited
resources. Those resources should be targeted toward making workplaces and workers safer, not
toward policing a new army of consultants.

These problems are compounded because the disciplinary action anticipated by this legislation is
insufficient to redress or deter the abuses for which S.385 creates an incentive. Removal of a
consultant from participation in the program is simply not enough to prevent or punish abuses
such as fraud or collusion. Further, the circumstances under which an employer or consultant
could be disciplined are so limited that the bill would pennit a consultant to continue to
participate where injuries and illnesses continue to occur as a result of incompetence or simple
negligence. In addition, it appears that a consultant's failure to identify a hazard would exempt
the employer from penalties for that hazard.

Further compounding these problems is the bill's failure to clearly identify the minimal
qualifications for a consultant. For example, section 8A(b)(2)(A) identifies practitioners of
certain state-licensed occupations as "eligible to be qualified" as consultants, but neglects others
and does not specify what experience in hazard identification and occupational safety and health
eligible consultants must have. OSHA is further concerned that this provision may create an
unfunded mandate for states to create licensing programs for safety and health professionals.

The Department is unaware of any concrete evidence that a third party certification program
would be successful. At the outset ofthis Administration, the idea of third-party audits was
raised at a meeting of OSHA's stakeholders, where it met with little enthusiasm from either labor
or business representatives. More recently, a State of North Carolina survey demonstrated a
resounding preference on the part of employers for an OSHA consultant over a private
consultant. Cost, as well as suspicion that the private consultant might attempt to sell an
employer unnecessary services, were among the reasons given in support of OSHA consultants.

Finally, the Department is compelled to object to the new "purpose" that has been added to this
section. The new "purpose" statement would codify the erroneous opinion that all employers
are unable to read, understand and comply with the OSH Act. It would further codify the
opinion that OSHA is unable to satisfy the compliance needs of each employer and employee
within its jurisdiction. The addition of such sentiments to the OSH Act is, at best, inappropriate.


Section 4. Establishment of Special Advisory Committee



                                                 17
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

Section 4 would require the Secretary to establish a new advisory committee consisting of
employees, employers, members ofthe general public, and an official from a state plan state.
The committee would advise and make recommendations to the Secretary concerning the
establishment and implementation ofthird-party consultation services programs under section 8A
of the bill.

Section 7(a) of the current statute establishes the National Advisory Committee on Occupational
Safety and Health (NACOSH), which exists to make recommendations on matters relating to the
administration of the current Act. Mandating the establishment of a new advisory committee
dealing with the new consultation program in section 8A of the bill would duplicate part of the
existing jurisdiction ofNACOSH and, as such, would be redundant and not in keeping with the
concept of reinvention and streamlining. In the event the Secretary needs to consult with experts
on the specifics of consultation programs, Sections 7(c)(I) and (2) of the OSH Act now give the
Secretary broad powers to hire consultants and experts, and to utilize the services of experts from
other federal agencies and states. Ifthe Secretary wishes to obtain advice through the
instrumentality of an advisory committee, she may establish such a committee pursuant to the
requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.


Section 5. Continuing Education and Professional Certification for Certain Occupational Safety
and Health Administration Personnel

Section 5 requires Federal employees who enforce the Act to meet the eligibility requirements
established under new section 8A(a)(2) for third-party consultants. In addition, these employees
must receive professional education and training every five years.

OSHA agrees that effective training of enforcement personnel is vitally important. OSHA and
the State Plans conduct a wide range of training programs to ensure that compliance officers
conduct fair and effective investigations.

The OSH Act is not industry-specific; it applies to a wide variety of workplaces throughout the
nation. Therefore, it has been OSHA's experience that individuals with broad professional
backgrounds become the best inspectors. During their first three years of employment, new
Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) are teamed with experienced inspectors and are
given over 250 hours of training on investigative techniques at the OSHA Training Institute
(OT!) in Des Plaines, Illinois. Additional training is mandatory for experienced CSHOs at least
once every three years. Finally, whenever new standards are promulgated, OT! offers
specialized training in these standards.

As this discussion illustrates, OSHA does train and educate its employees, but not in a manner
that matches the bill's inflexible requirements. We are concerned that the bill is unclear about
which employees would be required to receive this training. For example, would the agency's
attorneys be considered "responsible for enforcing this Act"? We are further concerned about


                                                18
                                                                               HeX-Dump Conversion ·
the cost of providing the required training.
Finally, we note that the bill contains no specific training requirements for the consultants for the
program created under section 5, whose inspections and reports may result in employer
exemptions from civil monetary penalties.


Section 6. Expanded Inspection Methods

Section 6 of the bill would allow OSHA to investigate an alleged violation or danger by
telephone or facsimile. The bill also states that OSHA is not required to conduct complaint
inspections if"a request for inspection was made for reasons other than the safety and health of
the employees ofan employer" or if OSHA determines that workers are not at risk.

OSHA has two major concerns about this section. First, although investigation of complaints by
telephone, facsimile and other similar methods is desirable in many situations, these methods
should not replace a worker's fundamental right to an inspection. In the past two years, OSHA
has reduced the time from the filing of a complaint to abatement of hazards by using telephone
and facsimile methods for investigating informal complaints. In addition, several offices have
experimented with these methods for investigatingformal worker complaints, but only where the
complaining worker agrees. However, these methods should not be allowed to interfere where a
worker seeks to exercise his or her statutory right to an inspection.

Second, section 6 would allow OSHA to forgo a complaint inspection ifit determines that the
complaint was made for reasons other than safety and health -- even if the information provided
by the complainant suggests that the workers in question may be substantial risk. Again, the
agency's determination as to whether to inspect following a formal complaint should be based on
the likelihood that workers are at risk -- not on the motivation of the complainant. Where
workers face substantial hazards, OSHA should act -- and is compelled by statute to act -- to
protect them. Moreover, it would be very difficult for OSHA to determine the complainant's
motivation. This exercise would consume scarce agency resources and delay inspections.
Ultimately, the agency should continue to inspect where it has reasonable cause to believe that
workers are at risk.


Section 7. Worksite-Specific Compliance Methods

Section 7 would create an entirely new statutory defense to an OSHA citation, based on an
employer's demonstration that employees were protected by alternate methods equally or more
protective than those required by the standard the employer violated.

The OSH Review Commission and the courts have held repeatedly that when OSHA's standards
require employers to adopt specific precautions for protecting employees, employers must
comply in the manner specified. Under current law, employers have the right to select


                                                 19
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

alternative means of compliance when literal compliance is impossible or would pose a greater
hazard to employees. In "greater hazard" cases, the Commission requires an employer to show
that a variance has either been sought or would be inappropriate.

Under these rules, the contest rate has remained relatively low; less than ten percent of all
citations are currently contested. Under this provision of S. 1237, however, virtually every
employer cited for violations of the OSH Act or OSHA standards could claim that an alternative
means of compliance was as effective as the standard in question. In effect, standards would
become guidelines, subject to challenge -- and potential waiver -- in every individual contested
case. This provision could seriously undermine OSHA's standards, tum every enforcement
action into a costly and time-consuming variance proceeding, and impose substantial burdens
upon agency resources, the OSH Review Commission, and the federal courts.


Section 8. Technical Assistance Program

Section 8 amends the OSH Act's "Training and Employee Education" provision to require
cooperative agreements between OSHA and States to provide consultation programs. The
Department questions the wisdom of amending the new consultation law Congress passed last
year with bipartisan support after extensive negotiations between Congress and the Department.

We are particularly concerned with further amending the program in the way contemplated by
section 8. Under section 8, the Secretary must establish a pilot program in three states for a
duration of up to two years, the purpose of which would be to test a fee-for-service system. The
fifty state agencies that already administer the consultation program have expressed very strong
reservations about charging fees in the consultation program. The Administration shares these
concerns. Those who could pay would be visited first, defeating the philosophy that this service
is aimed at small or highly hazardous businesses that cannot afford to hire other consultants.


Section 9. VoluntarY Protection Program

Section 9 attempts to codify OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program, requiring the Secretary to
establish cooperative agreements with employers, who would create and maintain comprehensive
safety and health management systems. The bill requires enhanced OSHA efforts to include
small businesses in the VPP. Participation in this program would result in exemptions from
inspections and certain paperwork requirements.

OSHA has supported codifying the VPP program, but we do not support this provision as
drafted. The VPP has traditionally been, and should remain, a program for work sites, not
employers. Although there are references to "the worksite" in the section, this vital mainstay
of the program must be emphasized. OSHA is also concerned that codification could jeopardize
the high standards of the program currently in operation. As drafted, this provision does not


                                               20
                                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
·
    reflect the idea that the VPP program is reserved exclusively for those employers who have
    demonstrated the highest commitment to worker safety and health. Ideally, any codification of
    this program should limit participation to employers who have truly superior safety and health
    records, but should allow OSHA the flexibility to define (and modify as necessary) the specific
    criteria for participation in the program. We further note that the bill does not include a program
    requirement for VPP participants to provide meaningful employee involvement in safety and
    health matters, which we believe to be an important component of the program.


    Section 10. Prevention of Alcohol and Substance Abuse

    Section 10 authorizes the Secretary to test employees and management for drugs and alcohol
    following any work-related fatality or serious injury. It also permits employers to institute their
    own testing programs conforming to HHS and federal workplace guidelines. Testing is
    permissible on a for-cause basis, as part of a scheduled medical examination, where an accident
    involving actual or potential loss of human life, bodily injury, or property damage has occurred,
    during participation in a drug treatment program, or on a random basis.

    OSHA strongly supports measures that contribute to a drug-free work environment and
    reasonable programs of drug testing within a comprehensive workplace program for certain
    workplace environments, such as those involving safety-sensitive duties, and which take into
    consideration employee rights to privacy. However, OSHA is concerned that it may not have
    the resources to oversee drug and alcohol programs.

    Section 11. Discretionarv Compliance Assistance

    This section provides that the Secretary may issue warnings in lieu of citations where the
    violation has no significant relationship to safety or health or where the employer has acted in
    good faith to promptly abate the violation. The Secretary may not exercise this discretion where
    the violation has a "significant relationship to employee safety or health" or where the violation is
    willful or repeated.

    Currently, the OSH Act provides that OSHA "shall" issue a citation for each violation it
    discovers during an inspection. This provision would change this provision to "may." As a
    practical matter, the impact of this proposed change is unclear. Federal case law demonstrates
    that OSHA possesses a greater degree of prosecutorial discretion than was recognized in the early
    years of the agency's existence. The agency has discretion under existing law to establish
    programs in which it does not issue a citation for every violation it finds. For example, OSHA
    has used this discretion to establish programs such as Maine 200.

    Nonetheless, OSHA is concerned that the change proposed in this section might be
    misunderstood by some employers as a limitation on OSHA's authority to issue citations.
    Among other things, OSHA is particularly troubled by paragraph 3(B), which allows the issuance


                                                     21
                                                                            Automated Records Manage~ent Systi:,
                                                                                    Hex.Dump Conversion


    of a "warning in lieu of a citation" for violations that the employer "acts promptly to abate[.]"
    Even though it allows OSHA the discretion to issue citations in such circumstances, this
    provision may signal employers that they need not take preventive steps to protect their workers
    prior to an OSHA inspection. As such, this provision could undermine both the preventive
    purpose as well as the deterrent effect of OSHA's enforcement program.

    Prompt abatement of hazards should be encouraged, but it should be encouraged through penalty
    reductions, not by eliminating any citations whatsoever for violations. Otherwise, employers
    who make good faith efforts to protect workers before an OSHA inspector arrives at their door
    will be treated the same as neglectful employers who have ignored their workers' safety until the
    inspection.

    Finally, the limitations on the Secretary's discretion are so narrow that they could lead to
    outrageous results. For example, the Secretary's discretion is not limited to cases in which an
    employer has shown good faith by implementing a safety and health program or in which no
    employee has been killed or seriously injured because of the employer's violation. Rather, the
    bill authorizes the Secretary to issue a warning in lieu of a citation if the employer "acts promptly
    to abate the violation" even if the employer has a long history of previous violations and causes
    the death of several employees.

specified in this section, the consultant shall discuss with the employer
the elements of an effective program.

            -(2) CONSULTATION REPORT-

                '(A) IN GENERAL- After a consultant conducts a comprehensive
                survey of an employer under a program under this section,
                the consultant shall prepare and submit to the employer a
                written report that includes an action plan identifying any
                violations of this Act, and any appropriate corrective
                measures to address the violations that are identified using
                an effective safety and health program.

                 '(B) ELEMENTS- A consultation report shall contain each of

                           '(II) REQUIREMENTS- The action plan shall outline
                           the specific steps that must be accomplished by


                         the employer prior to receiving a certificate of
                         compliance. The action plan shall address in
                         detail--

-(aa) the employer's correction of all identified safety and health
hazards, with applicable time frames;

-(bb) the steps necessary for the employer to implement an effective safety
and health program, with applicable time frames; and

-(cc) a statement of the employer's commitment to work with the
consultation project to achieve a certificate of compliance.

                    -(ii) SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAM- An employer electing
                    to participate in a program under this section shall
                    establish a safety and health program to manage
                    workplace safety and health to reduce injuries,
                    illnesses and fatalities that complies with paragraph
                    (3). Such safety and health program shall be
                    appropriate to the conditions of the workplace
                    involved.

          -(3) REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAM-

               -(A) WRITTEN PROGRAM- An employer electing to participate
               shall maintain a written safety and health program that
