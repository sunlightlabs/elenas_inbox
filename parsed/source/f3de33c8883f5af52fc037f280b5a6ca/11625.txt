1. EDUCAnON

Our major objectives on education over the next few months will be to: 1) frame the
education debate through the President's arguments that accountability, and targeted
investments in class size, school construction, and after-school, must be national priorities; 2)
keep Democrats united behind our accountability agenda; and 3) attack Republican efforts to
regain credibility and broaden their appeal on education, such as Domenici's jumbo block
grant and Coverdell's education savings accounts.

A. Education Accountability Act. Legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act which will require states and districts receiving federal funds to end social
promotion, fix failing schools, end use of unqualified teachers, issue report cards, and institute
discipline codes. Programs that are part of ESEA include Title I, After-School, Class Size
(see below), Bilingual, Safe and Drug-Free, Technology, Charters, and Teacher Quality

I. Presidential Actions:
-- Announcement in late March or early April of bill transmittal, perhaps preceded by leaks on
key unannounced components such as a new teacher quality initiative.

-- Release of Dept. of Education social promotions guide. The President would like to visit a
school district that has ended social promotion. He could accompany Tony Blair who is
visiting Chicago's schools before the NATO Summit in late April.

-- Release of Dept. of Education study on public school choice initiatives and the third year of
a 4-year Education Department study on charter schools. The President would like to do an
event at a charter school, and there are several charter schools in the District of Columbia he
could visit.

-- Visit to a poor, rural school in Appalachia or the Delta.

-- Address to a state legislature.

-- Commencement at a teacher college.


II. Republican Agenda: ESEA is the centerpiece of the federal government's K-12
education policy. This is a top priority item for Republicans, who will seek to have ESEA
reflect their key education initiatives --flexibility, block grants, and possibly vouchers.

II/. Timing and Strategy. The administration plans to transmit its bill to Congress around the
Easter recess. The reauthorization process is expected to run through much of 1999 and
possibly into next year. The House has already started hearings on the bill. The Senate and
House are expected to start mark-up this summer. Overall, we need to shape the debate
around the need to hold states and districts accountable for the use of federal funds rather than
around the Republican approach of providing large block grants with no accountability. We
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

need to enlist the support of key constituency groups, members of Congress and the public
around our accountability platform by working to identify and diffuse concerns that could
lead to opposition -- particularly around issues such as social promotion (of concern to c'ivil
rights groups and others), flexibility (Governors of both parties are concerned that our
proposal will not provide them with adequate flexibility to carry out these initiative), bilingual
education and the conversion of formula grants programs to competitive programs. Because
timing will be driven by an unpredictable legislative process, our goal will be to sustain efforts
to ensure that our accountability message is breaking through and to communicate with
concerned groups around key issues.


B. Ed-Flex Demonstration Program. Legislation to expand Ed-Flex to give all 50 states
authority to waive certain federal rules in exchange for showing results.

I.   Presidential Actions:
~- See timing and strategy below

II. Republican Agenda: Republicans have made Ed-Flex expansion their number one
priority. It will be the first education vote this session. Flexibility is a key theme of their
education agenda, and they will claim passage as a victory unless Democrats succeed in
passing a class size amendment (see below).

III. Timing and Strategy: This week the Ed-Flex bill is on the floor in the Senate and under
consideration in the House Education and Workforce Committee. The President has indicated
that he will sign an Ed-Flex bill that has strengthened accountability to better link the waivers
to student perfoflnance. If not approved this week, we will continue to work across party lines
to enact this measure, along with other key initiatives like class size.

C. Class Size. Legislation to authorize $11.4 billion more over six years to complete the
hiring 100,000 teachers and reduce class size in the early grades to the national average of 18.
(We will still also need to appropriate $1.4 billion in FY 2000).

I.   Presidential Actions:

-- Completed: March 6th radio address to release Dept of Education Class Size program
guidance, and challenge Senate to adopt Murray-Kennedy amendment.

-- Completed: Release of local allocations for Class Size program.

II. Republican Agenda: This is not a program Republicans love, but they funded it in the last
appropriations bill and are thus on record in support. Republicans would prefer to make class
size an allowable use of a block grant proposal. Republicans are also attempting to recast this
debate from the need for class size funding to one of whether to permit local school districts to
use this funding for special education (see IDEA/Special education section below).
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

III. Timing and Strategy: Senators Murray and Kennedy have offered a class size amendment
to the Ed-Flex bill to authorize the program for the remaining six years in the President's
proposal. The President strongly supports this amendment. Republicans are attempting to
shut-down debate and force a vote on Ed-Flex without having a vote on the class size
amendment. If Republicans succeed in blocking a vote, we should call attention to their
failure to support class size. Because of the need for school districts to have certainty regarding
continued funding for this program as they began to hire additional teachers, we will need to
consider whether to attach this to other measures. We will find ways to sustain the message
on the importance of smaller class sizes. Also, we will work to ensure that first-year funding
is carefully implemented so that school districts are not encountering administrative problems
just as this debate is underway.


D. School Modernization. Legislation to create tax credits to support $25 billion in bonds
to help build, repair, or modernize up to 6,000 schools.


I. Presidential Actions:
-- Events or statements coordinated with legislative action.

lI. Republican Agenda: Republicans will try to push an alternative school construction
proposal, which would change arbitrage provisions for school bonds. The school
superintendents organization supports this proposal; we will have to work hard to make the
case that this proposal is fundamentally flawed (because the proceeds do not have to be used
for school construction and go to districts that do not need assistance).

lIl. Timing and Strategy: Rep. Rangel will introduce the administration's school
modernization proposal in the House. A Sense of the Senate resolution on this issue may be
offered during the Ed-Flex debate. Ultimate success will come, if at all, on a larger tax
vehicle. We will continue efforts to promote message on the importance of dealing with the
growing need for school construction and renovation. We will need to address potential
flashpoints, including Davis-Bacon and Sen. Bob Graham's school construction alternative.


E. Education FY 2000 Appropriations Bill. Legislation to fund federal education
programs, including after-school; turning-around failing schools; class size; Troops to
Teachers; master teachers; GEAR-UP; Title I; technology grants; choice initiatives (charters,
work-site and magnets); and Safe and Drug-Free Schools.

I. Presidential Actions:
-- National Teacher of the Year event in April.
-- FY 99 grants announcements --e.g., after-school, charter school, teacher recruitment and
quality, Gear-Up, technology.
-Reports on various issues --e.g., charter schools, teacher quality, after-school.
                                                                      .       Hex·Dump Conversion
II. Republican Agenda: Republicans probably will support increases in funding, but will try
to push block grants and target increases towards IDEA (essentially a politically viable form of
block grants). Recent court rulings and new federal regulation may strengthen the Republican
case for increases in IDEA funding. We will have to counter with sustained campaigns for
increases in our priority programs.

Ill. Timing and Strategy: Appropriations Committee hearings begin in March; final bills will
get to the President in the late fall/early winter. Our overall message will stress the purpose
and importance of our education initiatives. Many of these initiatives were first funded - or
received expanded funding - in the 1999 fiscal year. FY 1999 grant announcements provide is
with an opportunity to take credit for Clinton-Gore victories and to call on Congress to expand
on this good work. We will also continue to identify members of Congress to champion key
initiatives and work with groups to ensure that they are communicating their support for these
initiatives to members. We will develop strategies to place op-eds and communicate with
opinion leaders on our approach of identifying promising practices, using targeted funding to
spread their use, and combining flexibility in use of federal funds with accountability for
results -- as opposed to the Republican approach of broad - and ultimately unaccountable
 block grants.

F. Should we add something on national testing/national standards?

CHALLENGES

A. Bilingual Education/LEP. The Administration's ESEA reauthorization will include the
President's goal of helping children learn English within three years. There is considerable
division around the best approach to teach English to children with limited English proficiency.
 Bilingual education - where students first receive instruction in their native language in order
to then learn English - has been the target of a ballot initiative (Unz initiative) in California
that the administration opposed.

Republicans may offer measures to effectively end bilingual education and/or require students
to leave bilingual education programs within one or two years. They may criticize the
Administration's position as for being too protective of the status quo in bilingual education.
Some groups who support bilingual education will criticize the Administration's effort for
being too draconian. Our legislative proposal in ESEA will accommodate some of these
concerns.

1. Timing. This issues will likely come to the forefront during hearing on the ESEA
reauthorization, since that bill will reauthorize the federal bilingual education program.

2. Responses. Introduction of the ESEA legislation will give us the advantage of defining the
debate early. Establishing a 3-year goal for learning English will counter criticisms that
children stay in bilingual education far too long - while at the same time allowing districts to
choose the education method that best suits their need (i.e. unlike the California initiative, we
don't specify whether to teach students English in bilingual or immersion classes).
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
We will need to address concerns in the Hispanic community through targeted outreach and
communications strategy explaining our position and legislation. This will include briefings on
our legislation to Hispanic groups and members of the Hispanic caucus, as well as a
communications strategy targeted at the Hispanic media. We also will need to identify
members of Congress in both parties who can champion our approach. Moreover, we will to
work closely with many of these groups to seek expansion of the Hispanic Education Action
Plan announced by Vice President Gore last year (an array of federal education initiatives that
serve high concentrations of Latino students) and find appropriate ways to ensure that existing
federal programs help students with limited English proficiency.

3. Presidential Action. It is not clear whether a Presidential statement will be needed. The
ESEA reauthorization will be transmitted around the Easter recess.

B. Race-Based Admissions. Admissions decisions that consider the race of the applicant
either for the purpose of remedying past discrimination or to enhance the diversity of the
student body.

1. Timing. Affirmative action opponents have filed cases against school districts and
universities across the country to challenge admissions that factored race into the admissions
decision process. In several instances (Boston, San Francisco), schools have changed their
admissions process to avoid legal challenges. Congressional Republicans may try and offer
amendments to any moving piece of education legislation to prohibit race from being
considered in school and university admissions.

2. Responses. The administration supports the consideration of race in school admissions
decisions to remedy past discrimination and to promote diversity. The counsel's office is
working the Departments of Justice and Education to monitor several of these cases and to
determine where federal intervention would be appropriate. The Administration also fought
efforts in the last Congressional session to prohibit the use of race as a factor in admission
decision and should be prepared to engage in a similar battle.

3. Presidential Action. The higher education groups are working on an effort to unite
university presidents behind an enhanced strategy to increase campus diversity because of the
identifiable benefits diversity brings to classroom environment (e.g., diverse opinions). If
this group is effectively pulled together, the President should announce its formation. The
timing is unclear, but this could be part of the roll-out for the President's report on the race
initiative.

C. Vouchers. Vouchers would provide tax dollars - usually those that would otherwise be
allocated to the public schools -- to students to use at a private school.

1. Timing. Republicans may propose vouchers as part of their own approach to reauthorizing
ESEA (spring/summer) or as part of the education appropriations or D.C. appropriations (fall)
bills.
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
2. Response. The administration should continue to oppose the use of federal funds to support
private school vouchers. The major education groups have also long-opposed vouchers and
we should continue regular discussions with them to coordinate our efforts as individual
legislative measures on vouchers arise.

The Administration's efforts to support interventions in failing schools -- and strengthening
school accountability more generally -- provide one effective counter to vouchers, principally
because voucher advocates typically use the image of students trapped in failing schools as a
major reason for advocating vouchers. Moreover, the Administration's efforts to expand
choice within public education can preempt calls for vouchers by demonstrating that we are
making progress expanding parental choice without hurting public education. Finally, our
efforts to invest in common-sense steps like smaller classes and modern school buildings help
round out an agenda that may make more sense to the public than markets and vouchers.
Partly because of these steps, Republicans are trying to scale back the focus on vouchers in
their education agenda, but they clearly will continue to press on this issue.


3. Presidential Action. A Presidential statement may be needed in late summer or fall if
Republicans propose attaching vouchers to appropriations bills or to ESEA. Moreover,
Presidential events on fixing failing schools, expanding public school choice, and reducing
class size and modernizing school buildings will help undermine the effectiveness of the
voucher message. Finally, the livability agenda -- its focus on schools as centers of
community -- may help undermine the voucher message by reminding people of the importance
of building up our public schools as centers of community rather than tearing them down
through vouchers.
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
D. Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Special Education. Many
Republicans are trying to broaden the appeal of their education agenda -- and attack the
President's agenda -- by criticizing the Administration's alleged failure to provide adequate
funding to help local school districts serve students with disabilities. Republicans argue that the
federal government should be providing 40% -- rather than the current II % -- of the costs of
special education These Republicans are beginning to make the case to the public that the
federal government should fully fund requirements to serve students with disabilities before
funding new initiatives like class size. Moreover, they argue that providing extra support to
school districts for special education would free up other resources that local school districts
could choose to use on reducing class size, after-school programs, etc. They argue that this
approach -- supposedly providing investments and flexibility to local school districts -- is
preferable to the Administration's approach of leaving school districts hold the bag on special
education and then direct them to spend other federal resources on specific strategies like class
size, after-school, etc. The Governors raised this issue to the President in NGA, and complaints
have been increasing from communities across the country about this problem.

1. Timing. This issue willlike\y be raised throughout the year during deliberations in the House
and Senate on Presidential education initiatives, consideration of the budget resolution and
appropriation bills. Moreover, it appears there may be a coordinated strategy for Governors,
school districts, and others to raise this with the president and vice president in meetings on
education.

Moreover, IDEA regulations will be released later this month. Major issues involve how the
regulations address discipline for children with disabilities.


2. Response. We have been arguing that special education funding has increased over the past
few years and that many of our investments in strategies like smaller classes also help special
education students -- indeed some of these strategies help children learn to read well and may
keep them from being placed in special education in the first place.

We are examining other strategies to address this issue.


3. Presidential Actions.
We are examining other strategies to address this issue.


E. Block Grants. Republicans will also continue to promote the theme of investments in
education coupled with flexibility though their block grant proposals.

I. Timing. The Senate could try to bring block grant proposals to the Senate floor this spring.

2. Response.    We will continue to emphasize the message that states and school districts
should be held accountable for federal funds -- rather than giving out funding without
                                                                                     Hex·Dump Conversion

accountability through block grants. Moreover, we wilI also continue to emphasize the
importance of targeted funding for important national purposes like smalIer classes and modem
school buildings.

3. Presidential Actions. Presidential events around his education agenda.

F. Teacher quality. Republicans will also likely advocate proposals to improve teacher quality
through initiatives that could be difficult for the Administration to support -- such as testing for
current teachers and merit pay for high-performing teachers.

1. Timing. The timing of Republican proposals along these lines is uncertain but could come
this spring or summer.

2. Response. The Administration's ESEA proposal wilI contain several initiatives to improve
teacher quality that will help define the debate early -- including ending the use of unqualified
teachers and supporting national certification for highly accomplished teachers. Moreover, the
Administration is advocating other teacher quality initiatives such as attracting retiring military
troops and talented young people into teaching. Special emphasis on the President's initiatives to
hold teachers accountable and support good teachers wilI be helpful in defusing possible support
for these likely Republican efforts.

3. Presidential Actions. Presidential events around his teacher quality initiatives.
