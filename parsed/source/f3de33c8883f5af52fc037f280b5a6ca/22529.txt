                                    FYOO Territories Issues


CHIP
    The budget would quadruple Children's Health Insurance Program funding for the
     territories with $34 m. (Congress agreed to a one year $32 m increase last year.)

Rum Tax
    The budget would give Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands the full $13 .50 per gallon of
     the tax on the islands' and foreign rum vs. $10.50 now. It estimates this at $34 m for P.R.
     and $12 m for the V.I. annually -- but the P.R. estimate is probably far too low.
     One-sixth of the additional $3/gal. P.R. revenue would be for the P.R. Conservation
     Trust.

IF NECESSARY:
     The proposal is for five years to address Ways and Means' primary objection to our
      proposal last year: a permanent increase over $10.50. It could be extended in 2004

30A
      The budget would open IRC Sec. 30A (the tax credit based on wages and other spending
       in Puerto Rico by companies based in States) to new investments and extend it past 2005.
       Estimated tax reliefof$4S0 m over five years and $S b over 10.

IF NECESSARY:
     Two differences from our past proposals: It (1) would not repeal a 2002 cap on the
      credit individual companies can take and (2) extends 30A to 2009 vs. indefinitely.

      Those provisions would have increased the cost to $738 m over five years and $7.7 b over
       lOin FYOO from $607 m over five and $6.2 b over 10 under our numbers -- which are
       significantly less than Joint Tax's -- in FY99. The tax relief of our FYOO proposal is the'
       same as that of our past proposal in FY98.

      There was little effort in Congress on behalf of our proposal last year. Archer has refused
       to consider it.

      This proposal: preserves the primary objective of opening the credit to new investment;
       provides as much tax relief as we originally intended; may be more achievable; and keeps
       the issue alive for further extension if there is the will for that.

Puerto Rico R&E
     The budget would extend the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit to Puerto Rico
       since some income from P.R. of companies based in States is now being taxed.

Guam Compact Impact
    The budget would hike reimbursement of Guam's costs due to migration made possible
                                       Automated Records Management System
                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

            by the free association compacts with other Micronesian areas from $4.6 m to $10 m.
     Virgin Islands Tariff Credits
           The budget would authorize tariff credits for jewelry made in the islands.

     Empowerment Zones
         The budget would not include the territories in empowerment zones because they have
          greater tax incentives for investment -- Secs. 936 and 30A-- but we are considering
          including territories when those incentives expire.

     Medicaid
          The budget does not propose lifting the cap on Medicaid in the territories (1) to
           concentrate on increasing CHIP and (2) due to the costs to which they do not contribute.

           Equal treatment might cost over $1 b a year.

     SSI
           The budget does not propose extending SSI to the territories (1) due to the close to $1 b
            a year costs to which they do not contribute.

     Education Act
          The budget does not propose equal treatment of Puerto Rico (1) because it already gets
           more than all but eight States and (2) that would give it more than all but three States.

     Medicare
          We will consider changing the formula for hospital rates in Puerto Rico from SO%ofthe
           national rates/SO% local cost factors to one using a greater percentage of national rates.

     Cigarette Tax
          We are considering extending the cigarette tax to the territories since (1) it is to
           discourage health damaging smoking and (2) raise revenue for health programs that
           benefit the islands.
