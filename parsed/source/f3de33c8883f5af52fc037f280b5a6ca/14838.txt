Prior to the Summit itself, we should do at least one event designed to highlight our own
approach and involvement with national service and voluntarism. The first ideas probably has
the most merit, but several possibilities follow:

        National Service Scholars Program -- The President could announce the launch of this
        $1,000 scholarship for high school juniors or seniors who do an outstanding job in
        community service. The Federal government puts up $500, and local or community
        sources match that amount. Civic groups like the Lions, Elks, and Kiwanis are being
        encouraged to fund the local match, and could attend the event. We would push to have
      . the first scholarship winners attend as well. By focusing on young people who do
        service, rather than purely volunteer efforts, this would reinforce the President's concept
        of service. The President first announced the scholarship program at an event last year at
        Penn State. Under the President's 1998 budget, the program could expand to every high
        school next year.

      Commit half of all work-study slots to service by the year 2000 -- Such an announcement
       could be made at a college with a good program of service-based work-study -- for
       example, where college students teach young children to read.

      Highlight Young People Serving Young People -- The President could attend an award
       ceremony for a program in Philadelphia that uses high school students to tutor
       second-graders. National Youth Service Day on April 15 could be highlighted.

      Feature AmeriComs alumni -- The President could demonstrate how the AmeriCorps
       program produces future service leaders by meeting with a group of AmeriCorps alumni
       at a literacy or early childhood event. AmeriCorps alumni are trying to set a standard for
       themselves of 10 hours per month of volunteer time.

      Faith-based Service -- The President could challenge religious institutions and faith-based
       organizations to create full-time service opportunities, and agree to give them National
       Service scholarships if they do.

     Commitment by Federal Government -- The President could announce some or all of the
      Federal agencies' commitments to the Summit. We are working with Federal agencies
      to identify what types of commitments they can make to the Summit's five goals.
      Possibilities include making a Federal commitment around giving young people the
      opportunity to serve; or showing how service could further all our existing
      Administration priorities, such as literacy, welfare to work, crime, etc.

     Earth Day -- This year's Earth Day commemoration should tie into the service theme.
      We are working with CEQ on this.

     President's Service Awards -- Summit organizers are pushing to have these annual
      awards presented by the President or First Lady at the Summit itself, but we could push to
      hold them prior to the Summit. They are considered the highest honor in the volunteer
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


    world, and are nonnally awarded around National Volunteer Week (mid-April).
   Give Federal Employees More Flexibilitv to Volunteer -- We could try to expand on an
    executive order by former President Bush to make it easier for Federal employees to
    volunteer (although one area of exposure is that it is not clear how closely we have been
    following that executive order).
