SUBJECT          PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE ON RACE WEEKLY REPORT
                 JANUARY 31 - FEBRUARY 6



ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

    February Advisory Board Meeting. The Advisory Board will be in Northern
    California on February 10-11. On February 10, Advisory Board members will
    visit Promising Practices sites in San Francisco, Oakland, and East Palo Alto.
    DOEd Secretary Riley will participate by visiting a San Francisco Promising
    Practice site, Glide Memorial Baptist Church, that focuses on job training. The
    Advisory Board will host a gO-minute community forum in San Jose on the
    evening of the 10th. Members of the public will have the opportunity to raise
    views and concerns on issues surrounding race. On February 11, Advisory
    Board members will convene in San Jose to conduct their sixth monthly meeting.
    The topic of the meeting is "Race and Poverty." SBA Administrator Alvarez will
    deliver a keynote speech and participate in a panel discussion. The panel
    discussions will focus on the relationship between racial segregation, poverty,
    and the persistent lack of opportunities for those who live in poor, concentrated
    neighborhoods. The morning panel will focus on national issues and includes
    William Julius Wilson from Harvard University and Douglas Massey from the
    University of Pennsylvania. The afternoon panel will focus on local issues and
    solutions and will include local, state and area program experts who can address
    welfare and community development issues.

     March Advisory Board Meeting. We have begun planning for the Advisory
     Board's March 24-25 meeting in Denver, Colorado. The focus for this meeting
     will be "Race and Stereotypes."

     CampuslCommunity Week of Dialogue. The Campus/Community Week of
     Dialogue is scheduled for the week of April 6. The goal is to focus on race in
     higher education institutions and communities as a catalyst to establishing
     long-term institutional and organizational commitments and partnerships on this
     issue. We are developing options for this week, which may include national
     events, nationwide campus events, and other campus events. We are
     coordinating this effort with the Association of American Colleges & Universities,
     the National Urban League, the American Council on Education (ACE), and the
     U.S. Department of Education. Secretary Riley may mention this effort in his
     speech at the ACE conference next week.

     Statewide Days of Dialogue. On February 4, we met with the YWCA to
     discuss Statewide Days of Dialogue. Governors will be invited to designate a
     Statewide Day of Dialogue for their states and the YWCA will work in partnership
     with other organizations to convene dialogues throughout the states on the day
     designated by participating Governors. We hope to announce this effort at the
     National Governors Association meeting later this month. This event may be
     launched in conjunction with the events sponsored by the YWCA, USA cable
     television network, and the Anti-Defamation League surrounding the National
     Day of Commitment to Eliminate Racism which will occur on April 30.

     Women's Outreach Meeting. On February 6, over 100 women leaders
     attended a briefing hosted by the White House Women's Office and the PIR to
     enlist their support for the Race Initiative and to participate in a One America
     Conversation. Maria Echaveste and SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez also
     participated in the briefing.

     Corporate Forum. We held a Corporate Forum in Los Angeles on January 30
     that attracted approximately 170 participants. Secretary Daley moderated the
     discussion and was joined on the panel by Maria Echaveste, Angela Oh, Bob
     Thomas, representatives from Rockwell International, Levi Strauss, Wells Fargo
     Bank, and three women small business owners. National Public Radio did a
     favorable report of this meeting in its Weekend Edition on Saturday.

     District of Columbia Latino Civil Rights Task Force Community Dialogue.
     On January 31, PIR staff participated in the first of a series of dialogues
     sponsored by the District of Columbia Latino Civil Rights Task Force. The
     dialogue focused on race relations within the Latino community. Approximately
     30 community leaders took part in the discussion.

      Hate Crimes Indictment: A defendant was indicted for conspiring with others to

          Boston Affirmative Action Case: A federaItrial began during the week of January 25
           in the controversial case over the admissions policies of the prestigious Boston Latin
           public school. A white student who claims she was not admitted because of the school's
           current racial preference system challenged its constitutionality. Under the settlement in
           a case earlier this year, the Boston school board abandoned its previous racial targets for
           student admissions and instituted a new policy under which it admits half of the student
           body solely on the basis of test scores and grade point averages, and takes the racial
           composition of the applicant pool into account in admitting the other half of the student
           body. The school district argues that the current system is a permissible effort to
           maintain diversity in the school's student body.
