TEXT:
OMB leg affairs made a reasonable suggestion that we should have a one
pager which makes clear that we not only oppose the chairman's mark on
privatization but any amendments which still allow some form of
privatization (i.e., Kerrey) which could be given out if Kerrey goes
forward.

This one pager is a revised version of what we gave to House Ag.  It
includes some of the language from the latest SAP.  Any comments? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

         The Administration believes that allowing states to privatize health and human services
          programs would not be in the best interests of program beneficiaries. Discretionary
          judgments about eligibility for federal benefits such as Medicaid, foster care, Food
          Stamps, and WIC should be made by impartial, merit-based public employees.

         Therefore, the Administration opposes the provisions in the Chairman's mark and any
          amendments which would allow complete or partial privatization.

         The Chairman's mark would allow the eligibility and enrollment determination functions
          of Federal and State health and human services benefit programs to be privatized in ten
          states and deems approved such a proposal for the State of Texas. Under this proposal,
          58% of the nation's Medicaid beneficiaries could be placed in a private system.

         While certain program functions, such as computer systems, can currently be contracted
          out to private entities, the certification of eligibility for benefits and related operations
          (such as obtaining and verifying information about income and other eligibility factors)
          should remain public functions.

         Without a change in law, states can already privatize all aspects of the Temporary
          Assistance for Needy Families program. They can also hire private firms to design and
          operate information systems, develop and recommend revised eligibility processes, and
          provide management training and assistance.
