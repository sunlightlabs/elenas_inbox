Modified Assault Weapons Directive

Q_    What are you directing the Treasury Department to do with respect to the modified
      assault-type weapons that have been reported in the press? How many and what
      kinds of firearms are at issue?

A.    Over the past few years, firearms manufacturers have modified, or "sporterized", certain
      dangerous assault weapons to circumvent the ban on their importation required by the
      1968 Gun Control Act and the 1994 Crime Bill. There are about 30 models of these
      firearms that are being manufactured in about 12 different countries, including modified
      Uzis, Galils and AK-47s. While only a limited nUmber of these weapons have been
      imported to date -- and about 20,000 so far this year -- permits have been approved to
      import 600,000 more of these weapons and applications are now pending to import one
      million more.                                            .

      The number of weapons involved underscores the potential threat to the public safety and
      necessitates that we take immediate action. The President's directive orders the Treasury
      Department to: 1) Immediately conduct an expedited 120-day review to determine
      whether modified assault weapons are properly importable under current law; and 2)
      Suspend outstanding permits on modified assault weapons until the review is complete.
      Thus, until the review is complete, the permits to import more than 1.5 million of these
      weapons will be put on hold.

      In the past, this Administration has used every tool available to keep millions of
      non-sporting, military surplus and other firearms posing a threat to public safety from
      entering the country and flooding our streets:

            In 1993, President Clinton banned the importation of assault pistols and
             toughened requirements for federal gun dealers.

            In 1994, the President banned the importation of millions of assault-type weapons
             and ammunition clips from China.

            The President fought for and signed the Assault Weapons Ban into law as part of
             the historic 1994 omnibus crime bill.

           The Clinton Administration successfully fought back repeated attempts by
            Congress to allow the importation of millions of military surplus weapons.
      The President's actions have helped to ensure that criminals are not better armed than our
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
     police. And we believe that due in part to our efforts, last year fewer police officers were
     slain in the line of duty than in any year since 1960.

Q.   Doesn't this directive really amount to a revocation of permits that ATF already
     approved?

A.   The directive does not revoke already approved permits, but suspends them for the
     duration of the Treasury Department's l20-day review. At the end of Treasury's review,
     existing permits will be revoked only if the Treasury Department determined that a
     particular weapon does not meet the statutory test for importation. Moreover, the
     importer would have an opportunity to make its case to Treasury before any permit would
     be revoked.

     The most important point of this directive is to ensure that -- in light of the new
     assault-type weapons that are coming into the country -- we are making every effort to
     guarantee that only legitimate sporting weapons that comply with the law enter into the
     country. That's the point of Treasury's review.


Q.   Why didn't you just take action prospectively and suspend pending and future
     applications for permits?

A.   Limiting our action to the pending applications to import one million firearms-- but
                                          allowing the importation of nearly 600,000 of these
                                          modified assault weapons under outstanding
                                          perrnits-- threatens to defeat the purpose of the
                                          overall review. That is why we are taking action
                                          similar to the 1989 Bush Administration decision to
                                          suspend already granted permits until completion of
                                          the agency's review process. We have roughly the
                                          same number of weapons importable under already
                                          granted permits as did the Bush Administration in
                                          1989, but today we are faced with pending
                                          applications to import roughly ten times more
                                          fireanns.


Q.   Does this mean that you are already planning to permanently ban these firearms
     from importation?

A.   Not necessarily. The directive does not tell the Treasury Department what guns should
     or should not be allowed into the country. However, pursuant to the 1968 Gun Act, the
     Treasury Department has an obligation to ensure that only legitimate sporting weapons
     are imported. Thus, the proposed 120-day review will determine what changes, if any,
     are needed to continue enforcing this provision oflaw. And ultimately, those firearms
                                                                            :":'\.- ~llU:1P   CC:1version

      that fail to meet the sporting purposes test will be pennanently banned. If an importer has
      an approved pennit for a banned weapon, their permit will be revoked only after they
      have had an opportunity to make their case before the Treasury Department.




Q.    Why did the President take so long to sign the directive?

A.    This is not an action the President takes lightly and we needed sufficient time to explore
      our options and to consider the implications of taking such a bold move. In addition, we
      received letters signed by about 60 members of Congress who argued that these weapons
      are not properly importable -- and we wanted to make sure we consulted with some of
      these members before proceeding. That being said, we moved as quickly as possible to
      finalize the final directive, and Treasury is now instructed to conduct their review as
      expeditiously as possible.


Q.    Can you comment further on the reported friction between the White House and
      ATF? Will this have any impact on the fmal outcome of the review process?

A.    I really don't think there is much more to add. As was confinned in Thursday's press
      briefing, some perinits were approved during the time that the White House and Treasury
      were considering the directive that the President signed today. I don't think that anyone
      at the White House or Treasury or ATF was pleased about that breakdown in
      communication, but -- frankly -- the reported reactions to this incident have been greatly
      exaggerated. More importantly, it's all a moot point now. The directive signed by the
      President temporarily suspends all pennits until the Treasury Department completes its
      reVIew.


Crime Victimization Survey

Q.    What were the most significant fmdiogs in the 1996 crime data released today?

A.    The 1996 National Crime Victimization Survey released by the Department of Justice
      confinns that crime is continuing to fall across the board and to the benefit of most
      Americans. Crime victimization rates fell to their lowest points since the inception of
      the National Crime Victimization Survey in 1973. Both the murder and violent crime
      rates plummeted .1 0% in 1996, and property crimes fell 8%. Rapes and car thefts were
      down even more. The decreases are even more significant when viewed over time: since
      1993, violent and property crime rates dropped 16% and 17%, respectively, and murder
      rates dropped a whopping 22%.

      The survey also shows that since 1993, reduct?d crime victimization rates were being
     experienced equally by men, women, and different racial and in!&eJit9W6'u~1ffiffiifi~out
     the country. And the sharp declines in murder are being felt by cities of all sizes and all
     regions of the country.

     When the President first took office, he made a commitment to take our streets back from
     crime and violence through a comprehensive anti-crime plan. That's why the President
     fought to pass a crime bill that gave communities the tools they asked for -- more
     community police, tougher punishments and fewer guns in the hands of criminals. We
     think today's numbers show that our combined efforts are making a significant and
     sustained difference.                     '


Q.   Are these crime numbers different from the numbers released by the FBI earlier
     this year?

A.   The numbers are largely the same and both confirm that crime is dropping. Today's
     statistics are released by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) as
     part of their annual National Crime Victimizations Survey. The National Crime
     Victimizations Survey is a series of in-depth interviews with approximately 100,000
     people representing about 50,000 households. The BJS survey measures fewer cases than
     those contained in the FBI annual report, but in much greater depth. The BJS survey
     yields vital information about the victims of crimes-- such as their sex, race, age and
     income level. Importantly, the BJS survey includes many cases which were not reported
     to the police. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports record those crimes which were
     actually reported to the police.
