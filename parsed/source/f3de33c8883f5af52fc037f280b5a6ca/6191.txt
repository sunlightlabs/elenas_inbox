              PRESIDENT CLINTON: KEEPING UP THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME
                                  January 30, 1998

    Announcement:

          Today, the President talked to Mayors about an urban agenda to help lead our cities into
          the 21st Century and announced the Administration's next steps to help communities
          keep up the fight against crime and drugs. Specifically, the President highlighted that his
          FY 1999 budget will include: (1) $50 million for a new community prosecutors initiative;
          (2) $28 million to crack down on illegal gun traffickers; and (3) over $17 billion to fund
          the most comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy ever.

    Helping Local Prosecutors Join with Community Police.

          Community prosecution is the natural next step to community policing. As thousands of
          police departments have moved from reactive policing to putting more police on the
          streets to work with citizens to cut crime, communities are looking to local prosecutors to
          playa more active role. Increasingly, prosecutors are being asked to spend time in their
          neighborhoods, help solve local crime problems and prevent crimes from happening in
          the first place. The President's FY 1999 budget proposes a new $50 million initiative for
          these purposes.

                Increasing Neighborhood Presence. Similar to the President's COPS program,
                 the main purpose of the Community Prosecutors initiative is to increase the
                 number oflocal prosecutors working with members of the community and
                 community police officers. This initiative will allow hundreds of prosecutors
                 offices to hire "community prosecutors" or "neighborhood DAs" to continue to
                 cut crime.

                Building on the President's COPS Initiative. By helping communities hire or
                 redeploy more than 70,000 police officers to date, the COPS program has helped
                 bring community policing methods to thousands of police departments across the
                 country. New funds for community prosecutors will continue to help local
                 criminal justice systems be more responsive to their citizens' needs.

    Cracking Down on lIIegal Gun Trafficking.

          As part of the Administration's overall effort to reduce gun violence, in 1996 the
          President launched the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) to crack down
          on the illegal gun markets that supply firearms to juveniles and criminals. The
          President's FY 1999 budget includes $28 million to boost these efforts.

                Tracing Illegal Firearms to Their Source. The budget includes $12 million for the
                 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) to work with local police
                 departments in 27 target cities to trace all firearms recovered from crime scenes


                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

       .'     Putting More ATF agents on the Job. The President's budget also provides $16
              million to hire 162 new ATF agents to investigate and arrest the illegal gun
              traffickers who are supplying guns to gangs and juveniles.

             Passing the President's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy. Expanding the
              YCGn is part of an overall strategy that also includes: $100 million for
              communities to hire more prosecutors and expand anti-gang task forces; $60
              million for probation officers and youth gun and drug courts; $95 million for
              innovative prevention, anti-truancy and curfew initiatives; and $160 million in
              Department of Education-sponsored after school programs.

Funding the Most Comprehensive Nation Drug Strategy Ever.

Last year, the U.S. Conference of Mayors held a special drug summit and recommended that the
federal government launch an unprecedented, no-nonsense campaign against illegal drugs.
Today, the President announced to Mayors that next week he will unveil a more than $17 billion
drug budget and strategy that responds to their concerns. Key provisions will be:

             Stopping Drugs at the Border. The President's new Drug Strategy will fund
              1,000 new Border Patrol agents and provide new resources to deploy the most
              sophisticated new technologies to close the door on drugs at our borders.

             Getting the Message to Our Youth. A continued commitment to the $195 million
              paid anti-drug media campaign recently launched by the President, and new funds
              to enhance the Safe and Drug Free Schools program;

             Targeting Heroin and Methamphetamine. Increased resources for the DEA to
              enhance its domestic anti-heroin and anti-methamphetamine efforts; and

             Treating and Preventing Drug Abuse. Increased resources for more treatment and
              better prevention programs.
