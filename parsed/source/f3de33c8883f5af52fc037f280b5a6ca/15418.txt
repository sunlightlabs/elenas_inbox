                               TEEN PREGNANCY EVENT

                            DATE:            May 2,1997
                            LOCATION:        Roosevelt Room
                            TIME:     2:00 pm - 3:00 pm
                            FROM:            Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      To demonstrate the Administration's commitment to reducing teen pregnancy and to
      highlight the one year anniversary of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy
      and their first 12 honorees. The event also recognizes the month of May as Teen
      Pregnancy Prevention Month.

II.   BACKGROUND

      The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy is a private nonprofit organization
      dedicated to preventing teen pregnancy. It formed in response to President Clinton's
      challenge, issued in his 1995 State of the Union address, that "parents and leaders across
      the country ... join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy." May 1997
      marks the campaign's first anniversary.

      Following his State of the Union comments, the President held a meeting at the White
      House with a group of prominent teen pregnancy prevention experts and advocates to
      discuss what could be done to combat the problem. From that meeting came a private
      sector planning effort that led to the creation of the national campaign.

      The campaign is chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean. Its Board of
      Directors includes Whoopi Goldberg, Katherine Graham, the Hon. Nancy
      Kassebaum-Baker, the Hon. Warren B. Rudman, and William Galston. Isabel V.
      Sawhill, President of the campaign, was an Associate Director of the Office of
      Management and Budget during President Clinton's first term.



                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
first, Whatever Happened to Childhood, chronicles the problem of teen pregnancy in the
United States. Using mostly previously released data, the report finds that: 1) although
we are making some progress, there is much more work to do and 2) there is no single or
simple solution to the problem so we must continue to be creative, innovative, and
persistent in our efforts. A second report, Snapshots from the Front Line, provides
examples of community efforts to prevent teen pregnancy, highlighting some of today's
honorees. The campaign is also distributing a previously released report No Easy
Answers: Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy, which finds that
only a few programs have produced credible evidence that they reduce the risk of
pregnancy, but the overwhelming evidence shows that sex education does not increase
sexual activity.

At the close of the program you will recognize 12 honorees chosen by the campaign who
will be seated in the front row. Each honoree supports prevention approaches that are
helping to lower teen pregnancy rates and strengthen communities. The honorees' work
embodies several key themes that are essential to preventing teen pregnancy:
       Emphasizing values and self-esteem in working with adolescents;
       Forging partnerships with the corporate sector;
       Focusing the community on a "unity of goal" to prevent teen pregnancy
        even when there are conflicts over program approaches;
       Encouraging adult-child communication;
       Involving youth in the discussion;
       Emphasizing the importance of male involvement in prevention;
       Recognizing the importance of program evaluation; and
       Involving the media in reducing teen pregnancy.

In your remarks, you will discuss two new teen pregnancy prevention grant programs and
new findings from a study of childbearing and family planning released yesterday by the
Department of Health and Human Services.

Grants: In Los Angeles yesterday (May 1), Secretary Shalala announced the two new
community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote responsible behavior.
One program will be aimed at teenage girls and the other at teenage boys. Each of the
grant programs will total about $1 million per year and involve public-private
partnerships organized by individual communities.

HHS Study: The Secretary also discussed a newly released study which shows that teen
sexual activity declined from 55 to 50 percent during the 1990s after increasing steadily
for more than two decades. The decline is small -- 10 percent -- but significant because it
shows that the long-term increase in teenage sexual activity may finally be over. This
data is part of a new study of child bearing and family planning covering all women
15-44.

                                                                         Helt-Dump Conversion

Over the past four years, the Clinton Administration has launched a comprehensive effort to
prevent teen pregnancy. Data shows we are making progress:

      Teen birth rates have fallen four years in a row, by 8 percent from 1991 to 1995, and
       appear to have continued to drop since then; and
      A new study, released today by HHS, shows the percentage of teenagers who have had
       sex declined by 10 percent in the 1990s (from 55 percent in 1990 to 50 percent in 1995).

However, there is still much work to do. More than 4 out of 10 young women become pregnant
before age 20 and 75 percent ofthose who give birth do so outside of marriage. Teen pregnancy
remains a major social problem for this country and one that none of us can ignore.

Administration Accomplishments

      Since 1993, the Administration has supported innovative and promising teen pregnancy
       prevention strategies tailored to the unique needs of communities. HHS-supported
       programs already reach about 30 percent or 1,410 communities in the United States.

      In his 1995 State of the Union address, President Clinton challenged "parents and leaders
       across the country ... to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to
       make a difference." In response to his challenge, The National Campaign to Prevent
       Teen Pregnancy was formed. The national campaign is a private nonprofit organization
       dedicated to preventing teen pregnancy by supporting values and fostering actions that are
       consistent with a pregnancy-free adolescence. This month marks the national
       campaign's first anniversary.

      The President has consistently supported efforts to reduce teen pregnancy as part of
       welfare reform, and the law he signed in August 1996 contains several important
       provisions:
             Unmarried minor parents are required to stay in school and live at home, or in an
               adult-supervised setting, in order to receive assistance;
              The law encourages "second chance homes" -- adult-supervised residential homes
               designed to provide teen parents with the skills and support they need;
              $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education activities is
              provided starting FY 1998;
             The law includes the toughest ever child support enforcement measurements
              which send a strong message to young boys and girls that they should not have
              children until they are ready to provide for them.




                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
    new community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote responsible
    behavior. One program will be aimed at teenage girls and the other at teenage boys.

Announcement

To mark the first anniversary of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, the First
Lady will today recognize 12 individuals chosen by the campaign for their efforts to prevent teen
pregnancy. The First Lady will also discuss two new teen pregnancy prevention grant programs,
as well as findings from a new study of childbearing and family planning released yesterday by
the Department of Health and Human Services.

Background

The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy is a private nonprofit organization dedicated
to preventing teen pregnancy. It formed in response to President Clinton's challenge, issued in
his 1995 State of the Union address, that "parents and leaders across the country ... join together
in a national campaign against teen pregnancy." May 1997 marks the campaign's first
annIversary.

Following his State of the Union comments, the President held a meeting at the White House
with a group of prominent teen pregnancy prevention experts and advocates to discuss what
could be done to combat the problem. From that meeting came a private sector planning effort
that led to the creation of the national campaign.

The campaign is chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean. Its Board of
Directors includes Whoopi Goldberg, Katherine Graham, the Hon. Nancy Kassebaum-Baker,
the Hon. Warren B. Rudman, and William Galston. Isabel V. Sawhill, President of the
campaign, was an Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget during President
Clinton's first term.

To commemorate the first anniversary of the campaign, the First Lady is recognizing
12 honorees chosen by the campaign for their outstanding leadership. Each honoree has

In Los Angeles yesterday (May 1), Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala
announced two new community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote
responsible behavior. Each of the grant programs will total about $1 million per year and
involve public-private partnerships organized by individual communities.

The Secretary also discussed a newly released study which shows that teen sexual activity
declined from 55 to 50 percent during the 1990s after increasing steadily for more than two
decades. The decline is small -- 10 percent -- but significant because it shows that the long-term
increase in teenage sexual activity may finally be over. This data is part of a new study of child

                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

Question:   Why did you choose to honor these specific programs picked by the National
            Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy?

Answer:     Each of these people has offered tremendous leadership in the fight against teen
            pregnancy. The honorees' work embodies several key themes that are essential
            to preventing teen pregnancy: emphasizing values and self-esteem in working
            with adolescents; forging partnerships with the corporate sector; encouraging
            adult-child communication; involving youth in the discussion; emphasizing the
            importance of male involvement in prevention; and involving the media.

Question:   What was it that Secretary Shalala announced yesterday in California?

Answer:     Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala announced two new
            community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote responsible
            behavior. One program will be aimed at teenage girls and the other at teenage
            boys. Each of the grant programs will total about $1 million per year and involve
            public-private partnerships organized by individual communities.

            The Secretary also released a new study that shows that teen sexual activity
            declined from 55 to 50 percent in the 1990s after increasing steadily for more than
            two decades. The decline is small -- 10 percent -- but is significant because it
            shows that the long-term increase in teenage sexual activity may finally be over.

Question:   How much has the teen birth rate fallen over the past several years?

Answer:     HHS last October released data showing an 8 percent drop in teen birth rates from
            1991 to 1995, and the latest data indicates that the decline has continued.




                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
            pregnancy rates fallen too?

Answer:     Teen pregnancy rates refer to the rate at which teens become pregnant while teen
            birth rates measure the rate at which teens actually give birth. Teen pregnancy
            rates and teen birth rates have both fallen over the last few years. Teen
            pregnancy rates fell slightly from a high of I 17 pregnancies per 1,000 women in
            1990 to 112 per 1,000 women in 1992 (the most recent year for which data is
            available). The reason we cite teen birth rates more often than teen pregnancy
            rates is that teen birth rates are more current.

Question:   What causes the difference between the teen pregnancy rate and the teen birth
            rate?

Answer:     More than half of teen pregnancies result in birth, one third end in abortion and
            another 14 percent end in miscarriage.

Question:   In other words, are you saying that teen pregnancy increases the incidence of
            abortion?

Answer:     Since 1990, abortion rates among teens have declined because fewer teens are
            becoming pregnant, and, in recent years, fewer pregnant teens have chosen to have
            an abortion. Today, one-third of teens end their pregnancies in abortion, and
            teens account for roughly one- quarter of all abortions performed annually. There
            is no stronger argument for teen pregnancy prevention and family planning than
            the need to reduce the number of abortions in this country.

Question:   Isn't abstinence alone the best way to prevent abortion? Don't family planning
            and sex education increase abortion?

Answer:     We believe unmarried teenagers should abstain from having sex. However, it is
            unrealistic, even dangerous, to ignore the fact that some teens will, in fact, have
            sex outside of marriage and before they are ready for it. It is for that reason, that
            we must simultaneously preach abstinence and teach teens about family planning
            and sex, including the use of birth control. By offering teens family planning and
            sex education, we are working to prevent abortion.

Question:   Is teen pregnancy primarily a problem in African-American neighborhoods?

Answer:     No. Teen pregnancy is a problem everywhere, across racial and socio-economic
            lines. About half of all pregnant teens aged 15-19 are white. However, teen birth
            rates are higher among African-American and Hispanic teens than among white
            teens.

                                                                     Automated Records Management Systerr

Answer:     Early parenting limits a young mother's likelihood of completing high school --
            less than one-third of teens who begin their families before age 18 ever complete
            high school -- and increases the likelihood that young mothers will end up in
            poverty. In addition, the children of teen mothers have more health problems, do
            much worse in school, live in home environments oflower quality, suffer higher
            rates of abuse and neglect, and are more likely to become teen mothers
            themselves.

Question:   What else has the Clinton Administration done to prevent teen pregnancy?

Answer:     We have done a lot.

            Since 1993, the Administration has supported innovative and promising teen
            pregnancy prevention strategies tailored to the unique needs of communities.
            HHS-supported programs already reach about 30 percent or 1,410 communities in
            the United States.

            In his 1995 State of the Union address, President Clinton challenged "parents and
            leaders across the country ... to join together in a national campaign against teen
            pregnancy to make a difference." In response to his challenge, The National
            Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy was formed. The national campaign is a
            private nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing teen pregnancy. This
            month marks the national campaign's first anniversary.

            The President has consistently supported efforts to reduce teen pregnancy as part
            of welfare reform, and the law he signed in August 1996 contains several
            important provisions:
                  Unmarried minor parents are required to stay in school and live at home,
                   or in an adult-supervised settings in order to receive assistance;
                  "Second Chance Homes" -- adult-supervised residential homes designed to
                   provide teen parents with the skills and support they need to finish school,
                   become good role models, and providers for their children -- are allowed
                   and encouraged;
                  $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education activities
                   is provided starting FY 1998;
                  The new law includes tough child support enforcement which sends the
                   strongest possible message to young boys and girls that they should not
                   have children until they are ready to provide for them.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
            pregnancy prevention and youth issues. What has Dr. Foster accomplished to
            date?

Answer:     Dr. Foster is a key part of the Administration's effort to send a message to
            teenagers of the importance of postponing child bearing until they are
            emotionally, physically, and financially prepared for the responsibility. Dr.
            Foster has spent the last year-plus traveling around the country visiting with
            teenagers and community-based prevention programs.
