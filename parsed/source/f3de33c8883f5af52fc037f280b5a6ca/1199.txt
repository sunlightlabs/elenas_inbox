                                    THE ECONOMY REMAINS ON THE RIGHT TRACK:
                                    Low UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES RISING AGAIN

                                                                      March 7, 1997
FEBRUARY'S JOBS REPORT POINTS TO CONTINUED STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW
INFLATION. UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS LOW, JOB GROWTH IS STRONG, AND REAL WAGES ARE
RISING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE.
  Unemployment Remains Low -- At 5.3%.
          The February unemployment rate was still at an historically low level of 5.3 -- its 30th consecutive
           month below 6. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5 . [Source: BLS.]
          The combined rate of unemployment and inflation has been lower under President Clinton than any
           other Administration since Lyndon Johnson was President. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]

  Real Wages Are Rising Again.
          Today's news shows that over the past 12 months, average hourly wages have increased 3.S -- well
           outpacing the rate of inflation, which means real wage increases for America's workers. [Source: BLS.]
          Today's number confirms what Business Week (S/12/96) wrote last year: "[F]or the first time in more
           than a decade, real wages are showing sustained increases ... "

  11.8 Million New Jobs.
        We already have nearly nearly 600,000 new jobs so far in 1997, and 2.7 million over the past year.
        During the Clinton Administration, the economy has added                     n.s
                                                                        million new jobs -- a faster annual rate
         of job growth than any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s. [Source: Based on data from the
         Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]

  Strong Private-Sector Job Growth.
        Over the past year, the private sector has added 2.5 million jobs -- almost twice the private-sector jobs
         than during the entire four-year period before President Clinton took office. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]
        93 percent of the          n.s
                                million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector. [Source:

    Turning The Corner In Basic American Industries.
        After losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous four years, 1,128,000 new construction jobs have
         been added since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S Truman
         was President.
        After losing 35,000 jobs in the auto industry during the Bush years, we have 105,000 new auto jobs since
         President Clinton took office. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]
