                         The First Step:   Drop Controversial Riders
                                                 October 5, 1998


The President has proposed a budget that focuses on the basic fundamentals needed to
keep the country moving forward:
               Saving Social Security First.
               Investing in education and in a cleaner environment.
           _   Leading the response to the global financial tunnoil.

The Congressional Majority has taken its eye off of these basic fundamentals. That is why
they failed to even pass a budget resolution, despite a April 15th legal deadline. And why they sent only one
appropriations bill to the President's desk before the fiscal year began. Instead of focusing on basic budget
decisions and making the needed investments:

       The Congress has loaded down the appropriations bills with scores of controversial and
        objectionable riders. Many of these controversial items have not been debated, hearings have
        not been held, and they do not belong on appropriations bills. These riders are an
        unnecessary distraction that pose a major obstacle to achieving a budget solution.

The time has come to return the.focus to the basic task at hand: achieving a budget
solution. Dropping these controversial riders is the critical first step needed to achieve success. It is
time to put progress over partisanship and to put common sense over ideology.


Examples of riders that should be dropped:
   Assaults on the Environment -- Scores of anti-environmental riders would sacrifice public lands to
    private interests by mandating overcutting on national forests, carving roads through wilderness,
    and denying taxpayers a fair return on oil leasing on federal lands. Other riders aim to cripple
    wildlife protections and thwart common-sense efforts to reverse global warming.

   Undermining of the Brady Law -- Extraneous language included would undennine undennine the
    Brady law by delaying implementation of the FBI's system of computerized background checks for all
    gun purchasers. Brady background checks have stopped nearly a quarter of a million illegal handgun
    sales and its implementation should not be undennined.

   Denial of an Accurate Census. The statistical methods incorporated in the Census Bureau's plan,
    which are based on recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences, would produce the
    most accurate census possible and virtually eliminate the large undercounts of minorities, children,
    and other groups that occurred in the 1990 census. The onerous House language restrictions on
    the Census should be dropped.

   Private School Vouchers -- House language provides for the use of private school vouchers in the
    District of Columbia. Instead of investing additional resources in public schools, vouchers would
    allow a few selected students to attend private schools and would draw resources and attention
                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
    D.C. students. This would establish a dangerous precedent for using Federal taxpayer funds for
    schools that are not accountable to the public.

   Prohibition on National Voluntary Education Testing -- The House has included language would
    prohibit the development, implementation, and administration of the tests unless explicitly
    authorized. This would bring a halt to the President's efforts to help States and parents raise
    academic standards through a voluntary national test.

   Undermining of Worker Safety Efforts -- House language would unnecessarily delay efforts to protect
    worker safety and should be dropped.

   Family Planning Interference --       Several controversial family planning riders have been added to
    appropriations bills. These restrictions would lead to more unintended pregnancies, abortions, and
    sexually transmitted diseases and should be dropped.
