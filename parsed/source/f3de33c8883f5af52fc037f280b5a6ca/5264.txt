                                President Clinton:
            Working to Keep Crime Rates Down and Assault Weapons Out

        Today's radio address: The President highlighted two important issues in his
         weekly radio address:

               (1) a new Department of Justice report showing continued and
               meaningful gains in the nation's fight against crime; and

               (2) a temporary suspension on the importation of certain
               assault-type weapons.

        Crime rates at lowest levels since 1973. Earlier this morning, the
         Department of Justice released the 1996 National Crime Victimization
         Survey (NCVS), and its findings are more good new for the American
         people. The NCVS shows that, in 1996, crime victimization rates
         continued their downward trend, and -- in fact -- reached their lowest
         level since 1973. Both the murder and violent crime rates plummeted
         10% in 1996, and property crimes dropped 8%. Rapes and car thefts
         were down even more.

         Overall, since 1993, violent and property crimes have dropped 16% and
         17%, respectively. The murder rate has dropped 22% during that same
         period.

        Most Americans benefitting from lower crime rates.       The NCVS also shows
         that, since 1993, the reduced rates of crime victimization were being
         experienced equally by men, women and different racial and income
         groups throughout the country. And the sharp declines in murder are
         being experienced by cities of all sizes -- and all regions of the country.

        Falling crime rates are no coincidence. There is no mystery behind the
         continued and dramatic reduction in crime rates since 1993. Thousands
         of communities across the country have embraced tough, smart crime
         strategies. That is why this Administration fought to pass a crime bill that
         gave these communities the tools they asked for -- more police, tougher
         punishments, better prevention and fewer guns in the hands of criminals.

        Enforcing our gun laws.    The President also signed a directive to ensure
         that only legitimate sporting weapons are allowed into the country. He
         directed the Treasury Department to temporarily suspend the importation
         of 30 models of assault-type weapons, and review whether or not these
         weapons comply with the law. Permits to import more than 1.5 million of
         these weapons will be put on hold until this review is completed.
