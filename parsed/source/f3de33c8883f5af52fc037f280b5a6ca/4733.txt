                                             Policy
Goals:
      Identify, develop and rollout concrete policy action items - both new ideas and
       enhancements of existing policies - that address racial issues either directly or indirectly.
      Coordinate PIR, WH and Departmental policy deliberation and announcements
      Focus on education and economic opportunity as priority issues
      Provide support to Advisory Board on appropriate policy areas and possible
       recommendations

Process:
      Immediately, integrate PIR staff into existing DPCINEC working groups in education and
       economic opportunity, health, administration of justice and other priority areas. Meet
       every two weeks to coordinate efforts.
     Task cabinet agencies within context of newly integrated groups to develop lists of policy
      proposals (updated regularly) for WHlPIR discussion and coordination - identify tough
      questions and re-examine existing issues or beef up enforcement of current law. Identify
       three policy initiatives for rollout by December (see attached list for options).
      Identify longer term developing issues for deliberation and plan for rollout throughout the
       year.
      PIR develops statistical resource books (quick fact book by Dec. 2 and larger resource
      book by March) to help identify additional areas of racial disparity that could benefit from
      longer term policy development and action.
      Identify and substantively support opportunities for regular and targeted policy events -
      bi-weekly or monthly - develop policy message consistent with communications strategy.
      Identify special problem areas in education and economic opportunities needing further
      analysis and study - announce research efforts early on for longer term research.

Products:
     Policy and budget announcements - list of three in education and economic opportunity
      for rollout
     Legislative proposals
     New regulations
     Statistics fact book - quick fact book and larger resource book from Interagency Forum
     Reports on problems or achievements

Resources:
     VP, First Lady, Agencies - Cabinet officials as surrogates, Congressional members
     Contract out special topics for expert analysis
     National Academy of Sciences, think tanks, foundations and other outside groups
     FY99 budget process - expanding enforcement and other priority programs
