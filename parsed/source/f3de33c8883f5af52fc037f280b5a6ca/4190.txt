MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:               Tobacco Update


       When you return next week, Secretary Shalala and I will give you detailed
recommendations on how to proceed on tobacco. We are scheduled to meet with you on Friday,
and you are scheduled to announce your position on Tuesday the 16th. This memo is a brief
summary of what we are likely to recommend and what strategic and policy decisions you will
need to make.

I. Overview

        Although the industry was hoping for quick passage, some Republican leaders in both
houses said this week that the tobacco settlement was too complicated for Congress to enact
before they adjourn in late October. Lott would still like to get it done this year, but with the
legislation being referred to six committees in the Senate alone, we need to stake out positions
that can hold up over time.

        Over the past two months, we have held extensive discussions with the public health
community, attorneys general, members of Congress, and farmers. The public health
community will welcome our recommendations on most issues: guaranteeing full authority for
FDA to regulate nicotine; imposing tougher penalties on the industry if it fails to reduce teen
smoking; demanding an additional $50 billion to offset the credit in the budget agreement;
making it somewhat easier to disclose industry documents; looking out for tobacco farmers; and
so on. The only concerns of tobacco opponents that we cannot easily meet are dramatically
increasing the overall price tag (Kennedy would like to see it doubled, to $700 billion) and
demanding to see all the documents before capping liability (Leahy, Waxman, and Skip
Humphrey are pushing for "no immunity without disclosure").

       The central strategic question is how far we want to push the industry for additional
concessions, at the risk of losing this opportunity altogether. Bruce Lindsey and I have


                                                 1
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

repeatedly pressed the industry on the most important issues -- FDA, penalties, and documents --
with only modest progress. We met with them again today, and will continue to press them next
week, but penalties remain a serious stumbling block.

       Bruce believes we should not go forward unless we have the industry on board, because
without an agreement on everything the industry will be free to use its considerable influence in
Congress to undermine provisions it doesn't like -- for example, gutting the FDA provisions if it
wins in the 4th Circuit. Secretary Shalala and the Vice President strongly believe we should not
reach agreement with the industry, because any deal with tobacco companies will be suspect, and
won't have enough congressional buy-in to withstand 6-12 months of debate in Congress.

        This debate may become moot, if we can't get the industry to come around by next week
on our bottom-line issues. In that case, I believe we should be both tough and reasonable, by
demanding more than the industry can stomach right now (on FDA and penalties), but not more
than they can possibly swallow in the end. I share Bruce's concerns about the industry's clout
and penchant for mischief, but a little tension between us and the industry might actually help us
during a drawn-out congressional debate. If we make this a fight over tougher penalties to
reduce teen smoking (rather than how much money we want in return for capping liability), I
believe we can beat the industry on a few points, even in this Congress -- especially in an election
year.


11_ Major Recommendations

       A. FDA Authority

        The first priority of the Administration in considering any tobacco legislation should be to
confirm and protect the jurisdiction of the FDA to regulate tobacco products. The FDA must be
able to regulate tobacco products, including by ordering the reduction or elimination of nicotine
or other constituents, through its normal procedures in the furtherance of public health interests --
without any special procedural rules or requirements. We should call on Congress to pass
legislation specifically empowering the FDA to require the modification of tobacco products
based on a finding that this change would reduce the risk of the product to the public and is
technologically feasible.

       The industry still wants to put one hurdle in front of FDA, by saying the FDA may not go
forward if a party affirmatively demonstrates that the action would create a significant
contraband market in tobacco products. But we believe the FDA should only have to consider
contraband as one of many relevant factors, including the number of addicted tobacco users and
the availability of alternative products. We would eliminate two other weaknesses in the
settlement -- the 12-year waiting period before FDA could ban nicotine, and the special
procedural hurdles such as formal rulemakings.

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
       B. Documents

         For decades, the tobacco industry has failed to disclose essential facts in its possession
about the dangers and addictiveness of tobacco products, and used attorney-client privilege to
cloak: scientific research and findings and possibly shield evidence of criminal or fraudulent
behavior. It is therefore necessary to establish an effective and speedy mechanism to pierce
fraudulent or otherwise improper claims of privilege and to force the disclosure of information
that will advance public health interests. The documents issue has become a rallying cry for the
most strident opponents of a settlement, led by Skip Humphrey.

        The settlement calls for a national documents depository and a three-judge panel to
provide expedited rulings on whether documents should remain privileged. We recommend
strengthening the document provisions by 1) allowing litigants to challenge privilege claims in
individual lawsuits, even if the three-judge panel had already ruled, and 2) providing the FDA
with access to all health-related documents, notwithstanding any claims of privilege. That will
enable the FDA to put the industry's considerable expertise on nicotine to good use.

        Even these steps will not go far enough to please Leahy, Waxman, and Humphrey, who
want to break: the companies' attorney-client privilege and insist that the tobacco companies
disclose all privileged documents before any consideration of a settlement. But the Justice
Department has expressed serious concerns about any broad abrogation of the privilege, arguing
that such an approach would undermine the privilege generally and might enable a tobacco
company official charged with criminal conduct to assert a violation of his Sixth Amendment
right to effective assistance of counsel.


       c.   Penalties

        The settlement sets ambitious targets to reduce youth smoking by 30% in 5 years, 50% in
7 years, and 60% in 10 years, and would require companies to pay $80 million for each
percentage point they fall short. Public health groups have praised the idea of targets and
penalties, but complain that the current scheme does not give companies sufficient incentive to
stop hooking teenagers. Our main problems with the current penalties are that they are
tax-deductible, abatable, capped at $2 billion, and too small to serve as a deterrent.

         We can strengthen the penalties in a variety of ways -- all of which the industry has so far
resisted -- but our current preferred option is a two-tier system, with graduated penalties that get
stiffer if the industry misses the targets by a substantial margin. The first tier of penalties would
require companies to pay $80 million per point if the industry missed the targets by less than 5
points in year 5, less than 10 points in year 7, and less than 15 points in year 10. This penalty
would be non-deductible, could not be abated, and would reflect a company's share of the youth
market. If the industry missed by a greater margin, companies would pay the full first-tier
penalty, and their settlement payment would be increased by a penny a pack for each additional

                                                                               Hex·Dump Conversion

percentage point by which they missed the target. This second-tier penalty would cost             .
companies about $240 million a point, and has the additional virtue of locking in a pennanent
price increase that will help further reduce smoking by youth (and adults). Under this approach,
if youth smoking went down by 30% over 10 years, instead of60%, the industry would pay $1.2
billion in financial penalties and be forced to raise prices another 15 cents a pack on top of that.


       D. Farmers

       We have made clear that tobacco farmers should receive protection in any legislative
settlement, and that the Administration will work closely with members of Congress from
tobacco states to forge a consensus. Secretary Glickman has traveled to tobacco markets in
Virginia and North Carolina to express this commitment directly to farmers.

        Farmers are primarily interested in continuation ofthe governmental tobacco program,
guaranteed purchase at set levels oftobacco crops by cigarette companies, and some provision
for buyout and transition to other crops, on a voluntary basis. Because farm groups and tobacco
state members have not yet coalesced around a consensus proposal, we don't need to commit to a
specific plan yet. The most discussed proposal is one released this month by Senators Ford and
McConnell that would require companies to buy a minimum amount of domestic tobacco over 25
years and would install penalties on companies that do not meet the stated goals for tobacco
buying. The proposal would also create a "Tobacco Community Revitalization Fund"
administered by USDA, but not subject to the appropriation process, which could spend up to $1
billion a year for 25 years from the settlement fund and would cover costs related to the tobacco
program such as administration and crop insurance, make supplemental payments of up to $500
million to producers whose income from tobacco drops substantially below the 1996 level, pay
up to $100 million in benefits for displaced cigarette factory workers, and provide up to $250
million a year for rural economic development grants.


       E. Funding

         Although the settlement is advertised at $368.5 billion, a variety of factors conspire to
leave us with considerably less than that to spend on any new initiatives. The $368 billion is a
25-year number, and must be adjusted downward to reflect a projected drop in cigarette
consumption of about 15%. For scoring purposes, OMB adjusts the amount down still further to
reflect lost business tax revenue and lost federal excise tax revenue from decreased consumption.
 Most of the rest of the money in the settlement is already spoken for, to pay for civil suits,
cessation programs, counteradvertising, and the states' Medicaid claims. The main decision you
will need to make is how best to spend the $25 billion research trust fund, which most of us
believe should be a 21 st Century Research Fund dedicated to cancer and other tobacco-related
research.



                                                 4
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

       Some in the Administration (primarily the Treasury Department) and in Congress (led by
Kennedy) believe the industry should be soaked for $600-700 billion. This is probably a
dealbreaker for the industry, but it would free up additional funds for new initiatives.


       F. Other Issues

        We will need to propose improvements in other, less prominent areas, which we will
detail for you next week. These include limiting the industry's antitrust exemption to prevent
unnecessary collusion and removing a little-noticed cap on punitives for future misconduct.

       We will give you a more detailed memo on all these recommendations next week, and
bring you up to date on our discussions with the industry, the Hill, and the public health
community.
