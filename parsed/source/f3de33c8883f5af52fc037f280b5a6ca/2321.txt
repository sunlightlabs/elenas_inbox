                                SCHOOL REFORM EFFORTS

West Virginia's reform efforts have been piecemeal rather than comprehensive, but nevertheless
have received high marks from outside observers. As both one of the nation's poorest states and
one of its most rural, West Virginia faces some unusual challenges in education. Efforts to
overcome these challenges in the past fifteen years have included a substantial investment in
information technology for the classroom; raising teacher salaries to near the national average
(when adjusted for cost of living); a statewide effort to replace and renovate decaying schools;
and, most recently, a restructuring of the high school curriculum to focus on job skills and
vocational training as well as academics. If the 1996 National Assessment of Educational
Progress in Mathematics results are any guide, West Virginia's schools are improving. The state
tied for third in improvement over 1992 in both 8th grade and 4th grade scores.

Standards and Testing

West Virginia has not made a substantial investment in development of its own standards. This
year, students will be taking the nationally normed Stanford Achievement Test. State
Superintendent Henry Marockie suggests that with adequate norm-referenced tests available,
state education funds can be better spent in other areas. He says West Virginia has spent less
than $100,000 on its standards program, whereas its neighbor, Kentucky, has spent nearly $29
million.

Rather than establishing academic standards and then developing tests aligned to the standards,
West Virginia started with the test first. Once selected the Stanford Achievement Test, he state
developed specific instructional objectives for each subject area, based on the content of the test.

School Finance

In April 1997, a West Virginia judge held that the state has not complied with a 1982 decision
ordering higher quality and greater statewide equity in schools. The original decision, which
included unusually detailed specifications for curriculum, personnel, materials, equipment and
facilities in 16 academic areas as well as in guidance, health services and transportation, served
as a catalyst for many of the reforms that have been enacted in the past 15 years. However,
although the state attempted to equalize funding among districts by guaranteeing a minimum
per-pupil allocation to every district, substantial inequities remain because districts may impose
excess levies on their residents to generate higher per-pupil spending.

Technology

Both Gov. Caperton and now Gov. Underwood have made technology a major priority in
education. As a result, West Virginia is a national leader in the use of technology in classrooms.
In 1989, the legislature launched the computer-assisted basic skills program, a ten-year effort to

                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
19,5OO computers for local districts and expects to meet its ten-year goal. The state's II-to-l
student-computer ratio in elementary schools is one of the lowest in the nation, and in 1996 the
legislature appropriated $8.8 million to increase technology in middle and high schools. To
date, 14,000 educators have been trained to use computers for basic skills instruction.

Forty percent of West Virginia's schools are now connected to the Internet, and state officials
plan to reach 8S% in 1997. Bell Atlantic has been a major partner in this effort, called WORLD
SCHOOL. The state has 320 distance learning downlink sites across the state. Students may take
a number of courses through the system, including advanced placement and foreign language
classes.

In February 1997, West Virginia received a Technology Innovation Challenge Grant from the
U.S. Department of Education , which will help lS2 schools in eight county school districts
(including Harrison County, in which Clarksburg is located), the West Virginia High Technology
Consortium Foundation, and several other partners increase the use of computers in the
classroom. Part of the grant will also support Technology Opportunity Centers, at which
students, parents and displaced workers can receive computer training and use computers for job
searches.

Teachers

West Virginia teacher salaries in 1990 were the among the lowest in the country, but are now
17th in the nation when adjusted for cost of living. The state's student-teacher ratio, at about
lS-to-1, is one of the lowest anywhere. Last year the West Virginia Education Fund, a statewide
fund established by business leaders in 1983 to foster innovation and excellence in the public
schools, helped overhaul West Virginia University's teacher education program. Students now
will study for five years and will earn a bachelor's degree in a subject area and a master's degree
in education. Students also will receive three years of internship experience through
"professional development schools" run by colleges and universities.

School Construction

A 1989 law created the statewide School Building Authority (SBA) to fund the construction and
renovation of schools. The SBA has funded the construction of 61 new schools and renovations
or additions to 780 schools.

Full-day Kindergarten

In 1993, the state legislature required all districts to offer full-day kindergarten classes to all
eligible students by 1996. A 1996 law allowed the state superintendent to grant extensions to
systems with significant school building projects or sizable enrollment growth.


Jobs Through Education Act
                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
five-year job skills plans. High schools must offer students choices of career clusters, each
incorporating both academic and vocational skills. The state's Certificate of Proficiency will be
replaced by a CD-ROM electronic portfolio containing students' academic records, awards, test
scores and exemplary work. Some groups oppose the reform due to its emphasis on early career
preparation, and a bill has been introduced in the legislature to repeal the law.


1997 Legislative Session

There were no new initiatives proposed or enacted in the last legislative session. The
Governor's major education priority was continued support for technology implementation.

One controvertial issue that arose during the legislative session pertained to funding for 4yr olds
in kindergarten. The state's school finance formula provides addition funds for 4yr olds who
participate in kindergarten programs. During the legislative session it became apparant that a
number of local superintendents were using this financial incentive to aggressively recruit 4yr
olds in order to boost state funding. Several legislators threatened to cut off this program
because they viewed the local behavior as an abuse of the funding mechanism. As a compromise,
the legislature delayed the termination of this component of the formula until school year 98-99,
since student placement and teacher hiring decisions had already been made for the coming
school year.

There was also an unsuccessful move in the legislature to end the state's participation in the
federal School-to-Work program, which has come under attack by far right groups. Supporters
of School-to-Work were able to tum this effort back.

Student Expectations and Parentrreacher Support

West Virginia recently adopted new instructional goals in core subject areas (its own effort at
standards); education is improving steadily. In 1996, the state tiedfor 3rd in improvement
over 1992 in both 8th grade and 4th grade math - very impressive, since it is 49th in per
capita income.

Q: A recent survey of high school students by Public Agenda showed that more than 70%
felt students would pay more attention to school and learn more if standards were raised
and enforced. Do you think we are challenging our students enough, or expecting too
little?

Q: [To students:] Do your teachers and parents push you to work as hard as you can? Is
schoolwork more interesting when the teachers demand more, or just harder? Could most
of your classmates learn more if they worked harder?

Q: [To teachers:] How can parents help teachers achieve higher standards for students?
What can teachers do to help parents be more supportive?

Q: What are some of the ways that parents are involved in schools here -- and do you think
that role needs to increase?

Q: [To parents:] How do you find the time to know what your child is doing in school, and
to help them? How do you let them know that they must work hard and do well? What
could the schools do to help you do a better job? Will it be useful for you to have the kinds
of individual test results for your -child that our standards plan will provide?

Teaching

West Virginia has one of the lowest student-teacher ratios anywhere (15 to I). Teacher
salaries, among the lowest in the nation in 1990, have been raised to 17th in the nation - the
biggest 3-year salary increase in the country.

Q: What do you do in this community to attract the best teachers and reward excellence in
teaching?

Q: What do you do about the few teachers who aren't effective in the classroom?

Q: [To teachers:] Were you adequately prepared by your teacher training programs for the
challenges you face in the classroom? Do you get the kind of support you need to stay
current, grow professionally, and become more effective?

Q: [To students:] Tell me about your best teachers. What makes them so good?


                                                                    Automafed Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

Q: How can we reward schools that are doing a good job?

Q: What do you do here in Clarksburg, and throughout West Virginia, if there is a school that is
not meeting standards? How do you give a school the help it needs to improve?

Technology

West Virginia is a national leader in the use of technology in schools - well on its way to your
goal of a computer in every elementary classroom by 1999. By the end of this year, 85% of all
schools will be connected to the Internet. So far, 14,000 teachers have been trained to use
computers to teach basic skills.

Q: How do computers in the classroom help prepare students? What do they enable teachers
and students to do?

Q: How are classrooms making use of the Internet? What kinds of resources and Web sites are
useful for students and teachers?

Q: Can new technology playa role in teaching the basic subjects, such as reading and
math?

Q: Does it make a difference to have that background in technology for life after school?

Q: What kind of special training do teachers need to use technology in the classroom?
Who provides it, and how can more teachers get involved?

Community Support

Examples: Last year, a new statewide fund (the West Virginia Education Fund) established by
business leaders overhauled the state's teacher education program to make it more rigorous.
A partnership between Bell-Atlantic and the state's Department of Education is giving all
public schools access to the Internet. West Virginia is one of the top 10 states in offering
service learning opportunities to students.

Q: What is the larger community doing to improve education here?

Q: What do higher standards and better education in the basics mean to West Virginia's
businesses? What can the business community do to help raise standards?

Q: I've been asking America's colleges to encourage their students to work as reading tutors, to
help 8-year-olds learn to read, Are there other ways in which colleges and universities can play
a role in K-12 education in West Virginia?


                                                                 '''t".,.,~ted Records Management System

Forty percent of West Virginia's schools are now connected to the Intemet, and state officials
plan to reach 85% in 1997. Bell Atlantic has been a major partner in this effort, called WORLD
SCHOOL. The state has 320 distance learning downlink sites across the state. Students may take
a number of courses through the system, including advanced placement and foreign language
classes.

In February 1997, West Virginia received a Technology Innovation Challenge Grant from the
U.S. Department of Education , which will help 152 schools in eight county school districts
(including Harrison County, in which Clarksburg is located), the West Virginia High Technology
Consortium Foundation, and several other partners increase the use of computers in the
classroom. Part of the grant will also support Technology Opportunity Centers, at which
students, parents and displaced workers can receive computer training and use computers for job
searches.

Teachers

West Virginia teacher salaries in 1990 were the among the lowest in the country, but are now
17th in the nation when adjusted for cost of living. The state's student-teacher ratio, at about
15-to-1, is one of the lowest anywhere. Last year the West Virginia Education Fund, a statewide
fund established by business leaders in 1983 to foster innovation and excellence in the public
schools, helped overhaul West Virginia University's teacher education program. Students now
will study for five years and will earn a bachelor's degree in a subject area and a master's degree
in education. Students also will receive three years of internship experience through
"professional development schools" run by colleges and universities.

School Construction

A 1989 law created the statewide School Building Authority (SBA) to fund the construction and
renovation of schools. The SBA has funded the construction of 61 new schools and renovations
or additions to 780 schools.

Full-day Kindergarten

In 1993, the state legislature required all districts to offer full-day kindergarten classes to all
eligible students by 1996. A 1996 law allowed the state superintendent to grant extensions to
systems with significant school building projects or sizable enrollment growth.

five-year job skills plans. High schools must offer students choices of career clusters, each
incorporating both academic and vocational skills. The state's Certificate of Proficiency will be
replaced by a CD-ROM electronic portfolio containing students' academic records, awards, test
scores and exemplary work. Some groups oppose the reform due to its emphasis on early career
preparation, and a bill has been introduced in the legislature to repeal the law.


1997 Legislative Session

There were no new initiatives proposed or enacted in the last legislative session. The
Governor's major education priority was continued support for technology implementation.

One controvertial issue that arose during the legislative session pertained to funding for 4yr olds
in kindergarten. The state's school finance formula provides addition funds for 4yr olds who
participate in kindergarten programs. During the legislative session it became apparant that a
number of local superintendents were using this financial incentive to aggressively recruit 4yr
olds in order to boost state funding. Several legislators threatened to cut off this program
because they viewed the local behavior as an abuse of the funding mechanism. As a compromise,
the legislature delayed the termination of this component of the formula until school year 98-99,
since student placement and teacher .hiring decisions had already been made for the coming
school year.

There was also an unsuccessful move in the legislature to end the state's participation in the
federal School-to-Work program, which has come under attack by far right groups. Supporters
of School-to-Work were able to tum this effort back.
