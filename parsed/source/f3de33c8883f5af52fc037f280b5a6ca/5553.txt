TEXT:
In response to your request for a more frugal approach, and in
consultation with Interior, I've got two new options, each complete with
its own meme.

Option 1 (LOWIND): This proposes to double the facilities improvement and       o
repair budget, and increase of $32.2 million.  It fits right within the
30-40 range Bruce gave me.  It eliminates any increase either for annual
operation and maintainance, or new school construction. Within the budget
range, this approach hits the most schools in the largest number of
states, while retaining a clear and definable impact ..

Option 2 (MEDIND): This proposal adds a doubling of the school
construction $ to the above proposal, and totals $51.4 million over FY 98
(and a mere $47.6 million over the BIA FY99 request.)

 You also need to know that in the process of working the alternatives
with BIA, I discovered that we have to reduce the claim for new school
construction at this funding level from 4 to 3; in effect an additional 20
million buys one additional school rather than 2, as originally claimed
(I wasn't able to determine why this additional school costs twice as much
as the others, but it does, and it is the next one on a Congressionally
approved priority list, so we can't substitute two other schools instead.
  This is also why the first option eliminates new school construction
altogether--given the practice of paying for a whole school at once, it
was an all or nothing proposition.

While one additional school doesn't sound like a lot, there are only 8
left on the existing priority list (after that, another list must be
generated). Consequently, moving one additional school off the list will
be seen as a big step forward by the remaing schools.

I recommend that we go for the larger proposal; its still a small amount
of money, and it enables us to claim to be doing something in new school
construction as well as in major repairs. And,   doubling funding in two
budget accounts will seem like a much bigger deal than just doubling the
funding for renovations and repairs.

SUBJECT:              Proposed Budget Initiatives for Indian Education


        Last July, a coalition of education-oriented groups from Indian Country proposed a
Comprehensive Federal Indian Education policy statement, which emphasized the importance of
Tribal govemance of Indian Education, the preservation and revitalization of Native languages
and cultures, and the need for equitable access to education resources. The coalition also
proposed an Executive Order to implement this policy vision.

       This proposal has been under review by DPC staff and the Domestic Policy Council
Working Group on American Indians and Alaska Natives. Pending a determination as to
whether the proposed Executive Order is desirable and likely to be effective in accomplishing its
aims, we have begun to identify steps that can be taken right now to improve education for
Native American students in schools controlled by the BIA and Tribes, as well as in the public
schools attended by large numbers of Indian students.

        The full set of initiatives we have developed summarized below. Most involve ensuring
that new education proposals and existing funding streams effectively target resources to schools
in Indian Country. In one area -- school construction and maintenance -- we are going further by
proposing a significant increase in funds over previous appropriations levels.

Tribal School Construction Proposal

        The BlA operates 185 residential and day schools serving 51,000 Native American
students, approximately 10% of all Native American students in grades K-12. Enrollment in all
BlA schools has increased by 25% since 1987. According to a forthcoming GAO report, BlA
schools, compared to schools nationwide, (1) are generally in poorer physical condition; (2) have
more ''unsatisfactory environmental factors"; (3) more often lack key facilities required for
education reform (e.g., science labs); and (4) are less able to support computer and
communications technology. Overall, they are in worse condition than even inner-city schools.

        We are recommending an increase of$32.2 million over the FY 1998 appropriations (and
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

an increase of$30 million over the Department of Interior FY 1999 request) for the Bureau of
Indian Affairs account for Facilities Improvement and Repairs. This proposal would increase
the number of schools undergoing significant repairs form 6 to 22, and would also provide funds
for needed portable classrooms, roof replacements, and other repairs. We also support the BIA
proposals for two related accounts, which provide modest increases in New School Construction
and Annual Operation and Maintenance.

        The Tribes would view this proposal as a significant step forward in improving the
quality of education for Indian students. Congressional delegations from the affected states also
would receive the proposal warmly.         .

         This proposal is especially important if you choose to propose a new school construction
initiative on the tax side, because Tribes do not issue bonds for this purpose. Even if you choose
to propose a school construction initiative on the spending side, this initiative would be valuable.
 In the Administration's school construction proposal last year, 2% of the funds were set aside
for a direct appropriation for Tribal schools, over and above the accounts discussed here. This
funding, however, is contingent on the passage of a school construction proposal, and in any
event, is insufficient to meet the Tribes' needs.

      We have developed this proposal with the involvement and support ofOMB, the
Department of the Interior and the Department of Education.

Other Initiatives

        We are working to make sure that other education initiatives that are proposed for FY99
include an appropriate set-aside for BIA schools and, where feasible, for public schools that serve
a large concentration of Native American students. These include:

      Education Opportunity Zones. A percentage of grant funds will be set aside for
       administration by the BIA, and the Education Department will be encouraged to provide
       at least one grant to a rural school district with a large percentage of Native American
       students.

      Early Intervention College/School Partnerships. We are working to determine the best
       ways to ensure that Tribal Colleges can effectively participate in this initiative, as well as
       to fund other college/school partnerships in communities with a large percentage of
       Native American students.

      Child Care. The Child Care Block Grant already contains a set aside for administration
       by BIA. Proposed funding increases in this program will automatically benefit programs
       serving Native Americans on reservations.

      Technology. This year the BIA launched Access.Native America, an initiative to
       implement the four pillars of your technology challenge and to connect all schools,
       classrooms, and libraries to the Department of Interior's Internet backbone by the year
    Schools and Libraries Corporation to help Tribal schools take advantage of the e-rate.
    As a result, the Corporation has agreed that BIA can apply for the e-rate on behalf of all
    Tribal schools, and BIA has begun to develop materials and plan training so that schools
    can complete the necessary applications.

   Teacher Preparation and Recruitment. This initiative, which you announced at the
    NAACP Convention on July 17, helps to prepare and recruit teachers to serve in
    high-poverty urban and rural communities. At the time this proposal was developed, we
    did not target funds to Tribal schools. We are in the process of preparing new legislative
    language to take care of that omission, and will work with our Congressional allies to
    incorporate it into our proposal.

Tribal School Construction Proposal

       The BIA operates 185 residential and day schools serving 51,000 Native American
students, approximately 10% of all Native American students in grades K-12. Emollment in all
BIA schools has increased by 25% since 1987. Emollment in just the day schools has increased
47% since 1987 and 24% since 1992. Consequently, BIA schools have experienced significant
problems with overcrowding. In addition, according to a forthcoming GAO report, BIA schools,
compared to schools nationwide, (1) are generally in poorer physical condition; (2) have more
"unsatisfactory environmental factors"; (3) more often lack key facilities required for education
reform (e.g., science labs); and (4) are less able to support computer and communications
technology. Overall, they are in worse condition than even inner-city schools.

        We are recommending an increase of $51.4 million over the FY 1998 appropriations (and
an increase of$47.6 million over the Department of Interior FY 1999 request) for two Bureau of
Indian Affairs accounts for New School Construction, and Facilities Improvement and Repairs.
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

        The proposed increase would double funding for new school construction and for
significant improvements and repairs of existing facilities_ Compared to the BIA FY 1999
request, this step would increase the number of new schools to be built from 2 to 3, and increase
the number of schools undergoing significant improvements or repairs from 6 to 22. The higher
budget request would also provide funds for needed portable classrooms, roof replacements, and
other repairs.
