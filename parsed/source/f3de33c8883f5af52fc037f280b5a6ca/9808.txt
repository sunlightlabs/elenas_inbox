"We are facing a critical juncture in the fight against breast cancer. Our national commitment-- in
the form of increased federal investment, additional private support, and a dose of heart and hard work
-- is beginning to payoff as we witness enormous progress against the disease. With more investments
at this critical time, we call truly hope for successful ways to prevent, detect, treat, and one day cure to
this cancer that strikes so mallY women. "

                                                         First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton


Today, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced: the
largest funding increase in the history of the National Cancer Institute (NCI); the largest clinical trial of
drugs with the potential to prevent breast cancer; and an expanded mammography outreach campaign.
The First Lady also released a landmark five-year report from the Federal Coordinating Committee on
Breast Cancer charting extraordinary progress in breast cancer research, prevention and treatment. The
First Lady:

Announced Record Funding Increases for the National Cancer Institute.        As part of the recent budget
agreement, Congress passed a significant down-payment on the President's 21st Century Research Fund.
Today, the First Lady announced that the National Cancer Institute will receive a total budget of over $2.9
billion in FY 1999, a $375 million increase that will enable NCI to fund critical new research activities.
The First Lady also note that this increase was strongly advocated for by the Vice President. Over ten
percent of this increase will go to fund initiatives to increase patient participation in clinical trials; efforts to
meet the President and Vice President's challenge to translate progress into better genetics to create
diagnostic techniques for every major cancer by the year 2000; and other investments to develop new
early detection methods. This increase will also fund seven new breast cancer treatment clinical trials,
including a trial to expand the use of Herceptin to treat breast cancer earlier. This budget will build on
historic increases in breast cancer at the NCI during the Clinton Administration from $283 million in FY
1993 to $433 million in FY 1998. The Department of Defense will spend an additional $135 million in
FY 1999 on innovative peer-reviewed breast cancer.

Announced Largest Clinical Trial of Drugs With Potential to Reduce the Risk of Developing Breast Cancer.
The First Lady also announced a new clinical trial to compare tamoxifen, a drug that has been shown to
reduce the risk of developing breast cancer, to raloxifene, which researchers believe may also reduce risk,
but with fewer side effects. The unique STAR trial will involve 22,000 women at increased risk of breast
cancer and is scheduled to open at approximately 400 sites across the United States and Canada early next
year. Underscoring the need to examine all aspects of breast cancer, the First Lady also highlighted an
important trial underway at NIH examining the relationship between low-fat diet and prevention of breast
cancer.

Expanded Awareness Campaign To HeJp Ensure Women Get Recommended Mammograms. The First Lady
also unveiled an expanded outreach and education campaign to encourage women ages 65 years and older
mammography Medicare benefit that the President proposed and signed into law that covers annual
mammograms and makes them more affordable. HHS is also expanding outreach efforts to special
populations -- low-income and minority women -- who tend to have the highest breast cancer mortality
rates. For example, the Health Care Financing Administration has initiated a pilot program to provide
free mammogram screenings and air public service announcements in key cities targeted to minority
communities, while the Food and Drug Administration has developed and distributed educational
materials to underserved communities around the country.

UnveiJed Landmark Report on Progress Against Breast Cancer in the Last Five Years.     The First Lady also
released a new report from the Federal Coordinating Committee on Breast Cancer highlighting the
accomplishments in breast cancer over the past five years, since the Administration took office. This
report underscores critical progress the Administration has made, including:
       A significant investment in research--reaching over $550 million in 1998 that has led to historic
        advances in breast cancer, such as the identification of new breast cancer genes, and promising
        new treatments, such as Taxol and Herceptin;
       Improved the quality and availability of prevention tools like mammograms, through efforts such
        as a new Medicare mammography benefit, an unprecedented outreach campaign to encourage
        older women to get mammograms, as well as improvements in the quality of mammograms
        through the Mammography Quality Standards Act;
       Enhanced access to treatment and quality of care for women with breast cancer by increasing
        access to cancer clinical trials, new projects to improve detection and care among low-income and
        minority women; and launching
       Innovative interagency and public-private partnerships that have made remarkable strides, such as
        applying the latest in defense and space technology to better detect cancerous tissues and to
        develop less intrusive surgery methods for patients.

Highlighted That Congress Has Adjourned Without Passing Critical Legislation to Advance the Fight Against
Breast Cancer. The First Lady also outlined the agenda that has yet to be finished by this Congress,
including:

      A Patients' Bill of Rights. The Clinton Administration has repeatedly urged the Congress
       to pass a strong, enforceable patients' bill of rights that would assure Americans the quality
       health care they need. A patients' bill of rights contains critical patient protections for
       women with breast cancer, such as assuring access to specialists, continuity of care so that
       women are not required to change doctors in the middle of treatment, and an independent
       appeals process to address concerns that health plans are unfairly delaying or denying care.

      Legislation to End Genetic Discrimination. Studies show that a leading reason women do not get
       new genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer is because they worry about discrimination.
       To ensure that new advances in genetics are used to improve health rather than to discriminate
       against individuals, the President has called for legislation prohibiting health plans and employers
       from discriminating against individuals on the basis of their genetic information.

      Bipartisan Initiative Authorizing Coverage of Cancer Clinical Trials for Medicare
       Beneficiaries. Americans over the age of 65 make up half of all cancer patients, and are 10 times

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

    more likely to get cancer than younger Americans. Older Americans, however, frequently cannot
    participate in cutting-edge cancer clinical trials because Medicare does not pay for experimental
    treatments. The Congress has adjourned without passing the Administration's proposal, similar
    to legislation supported by Senators Mack and Rockefeller, that authorizes coverage of clinical
    trials for Medicare beneficiaries without harming the Trust Fund.
