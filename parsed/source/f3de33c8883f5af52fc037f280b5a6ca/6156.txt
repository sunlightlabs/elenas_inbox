ENTITLEMENT REFORM

Reserve Surplus until Social Security is Reformed

Over the next two years, President Clinton is firmly committed to strengthening Social Security for
the 21 st century. He therefore proposes that we should not spend any of the projected budget
surpluses on anything else until we have reformed Social Security. This proposal, which continues
the fiscally responsible policies that have been the hallmark of this Administration, is intended to
reserve the surpluses in case they are needed for Social Security reform.


EDUCATION

Small Classes with Qualified Teachers to Improve Reading in Grades 1-3

President Clinton is proposing a $12.4 billion initiative over 7 years ($7.3 billion over 5 years) to
help local schools provide small classes with qualified teachers in the early grades. This initiative
will help ensure that every child receives personal attention, learns to read independently, and gets a
solid foundation for further learning. The new initiative will reduce class size from a nationwide
average of 22 in grades 1-3 to an average of 18, providing funds to help local school districts hire an
additional 100,000 well-prepared teachers. The initiative will also provide funds to states and
local school districts to test new teachers, develop more rigorous teacher' testing and certification
requirements, and train teachers in effective reading instruction practices. School districts will be
accountable for demonstrating gains in reading achievement. These steps will help ensure that first
through third grade students are receiving high-quality reading instruction in smaller classes from
competent teachers.

Modern School Buildings to Improve Student Learning

For students to learn, schools must be well-equipped and be able to accommodate smaller class
sizes. To address these and other critical needs, President Clinton is proposing federal tax credits
to pay interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds to build and renovate public schools. This initiative
provides more than double the assistance of the Administration's earlier school construction
proposal, which covered half the interest on an estimated $20 billion in bonds. The tax credits will
cost the Treasury $5 billion over 5 years, and more than $10 billion over ten years. Of the $22
billion in bond authority, nearly $20 billion for a new School Modernization Bonds. Half of this
bond authority will be allocated to the 100 school districts with the largest number of low-income
children, and the other half will be allocated to the states.
Helping Students in Poor Communities Reach High Standards

This initiative will strengthen public schools and help students master the basic and advanced skills
where the need is greatest: in high-poverty urban and rural communities where low expectations, too
many poorly prepared teachers, and overwhelmed school systems create significant barriers to high
achievement. The Education Department will select approximately fifty high-poverty urban and
rural school districts with: (1) a de~onstrated commitment to use high standards and tests as tools to
identify and provide help to students, teachers and schools who need it; (2) a strategy to prevent
students from falling behind by ensuring quality teaching, challenging curricula, and extended
learning time; (3) programs to end social promotion and tum around failing schools; and (4) evidence
of improved student achievement. Added investments in these communities will accelerate their
progress and provide models of successful, standards-based reform for the nation. The President's
initiative will invest $200 million in FY99, and $1.5 billion over 5 years, in raising achievement and
sharing lessons learned with school districts around the country.

Early Intervention to Promote College Attendance

President Clinton will soon announce a long-term effort to bring college opportunity to children in
high-poverty areas by providing their families with early information about financial aid and
appropriate academic preparation, as well as mentoring and other support services to help the children
stay on track through high school graduation and into college.



LEADING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY

Fast Track

America needs fast track to continue to create higher-paying jobs for more Americans. Without it,
America's role as the largest exporter in the world will be put in jeopardy. And with new markets
opening around the world, it is more important than ever to give the President traditional trade
authority to break down trade barriers that put American products made by American workers at a
disadvantage. Fast track legislation is essentially an agreement between Congress and the president on
how Congress will consider United States trade agreements negotiated by the President. As part of
that deal, the President agrees to extensively consult and coordinate with Congress throughout trade
negotiations. In return, Congress votes on legislation implementing trade deals within a fixed period
of time, on a up or down basis, and with no amendments. Every president since 1974 has enjoyed fast
track authority.

We are working with members from both parties to secure swift passage of legislation that will
bring the promise of 21st century prosperity to African nations that are prepared to undertake
the hard work of reform. This legislation will introduce a new era of prosperity and
partnership between African reformers and the United States, expanding trade opportunities
for African and American workers, farmers and companies, and hope and opportunity for our
children. This legislation will encourage African nations to undertake sound growth policies
by expanding trade and encouraging investment.

 Child Labor

  This initiative will make the U.S. a world leader in the fight to reduce child labor. The
. initiative focuses on reducing the most intolerable forms on child labor --"slavery" through
  forced or indentured labor, work by very young children, and work in dangerous
  conditions -- by increasing the nation's contribution to the International Program for the
  Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC) from $3 million to $30 million. The proposal also calls for
  additional agents for the U.S. Customs Service to enforce the ban on the importation of goods
  made with forced or indentured child labor, with a particular focus on rugs from South Asia.
  On the domestic front, the proposal includes a $50 million increase in migrant education to
  serve 100,000 more children of migrant farm workers and a $9 million increase in the
  Department of Labor b':ldget to enforce U.S. child labor laws -- especially in the agricultural
  sector.

 Community and Economic Adjustment Initiative

 To help communities compete in a global economy, the Community and Economic Adjustment
 Initiative will borrow a page from the Administration's successful adjustment effort for base
 closure communities. Modeled after the. Defense Department's highly respected Office of
 Economic Adjustment, the Office of Community and Economic Adjustment (OCEA) will
 provide grants and other assistance to communities to develop an economic adjustment
 strategy. The President will propose $50 million in additional community adjustment
 assistance as part of the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration's
 (ED A) budget. This will allow us to do more for communities that have suffered through
 sudden and severe economic dislocation, such as plant closings. As OEA has done for base
 closure communities, OCEA will closely with the Departments of Labor, Housing and Urban
 Development, Transportation, and other federal agencies to make communities aware of all
 available federalr-esources and to provide a coordinated Administration response.



 TRAINING

 Reform of the Federal Job Training System

 The President renewed his call for Congressional action to reform the job training system. In his
 1995 G.I. Bill for America's Workers, he called for individual empowerment through skills grants,
standards. The House has passed legislation based on his vision. The Workforce Investment
Partnership Act has bipartisan support and is under consideration in the Senate.
A SOCIETY ROOTED IN RESPONSIBILITY


MOVING PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers

The President's budget will provide $283 million in FY99 for 50,000 new housing vouchers for
welfare recipients who need housing assistance to get or keep a job. Families could use these
housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable
housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time. These
vouchers, awarded to communities on a competitive basis, will give people on welfare a new tool to
make the transition to a job and succeed in the work place. The proposal will complement the
President's $100 million a year welfare to work transportation plan, part of his NEXTEA bill, which
will help welfare recipients make their daily commutes.

Increasing Child Support Collections

President Clinton's crackdown on deadbeat parents is paying off: child support collections rose to a
record $13 billion in 1997, an increase of 63 percent since 1992. In the State of the Union, the
President set a goal of increasing collections to $20 billion by the year 2000.

Falling Welfare Caseloads

The President announced that we have met -- two years ahead of schedule -- the challenge he
made in last year's State of the Union to move two million more Americans off of welfare by the
year 2000. New caseload numbers show that welfare caseloads fell by 4.3 million since President
Clinton took office, two million more than the 2.25 million decline he announced last year. The new
figures, from September 1997, show 9.8 million Americans on welfare, down from 14.1 million in
January 1993 -- a drop of 30 percent.

Business Welfare to Work Commitments

In his State of the Union address last year, the President challenged the business community to create
jobs so that people can move from welfare to work. Today, nearly 3,000 companies have accepted
the President's challenge and joined a new national effort, called the Welfare to Work Partnership,
which was launched at the White House in May. Now, the President has challenged thousands more
companies to join the Partnership to give even more people a chance to work their way off welfare.

Protecting Patients Through a Consumer Bill of Rights and Genetic Screening Protections

The President called on Congress to pass federally enforceable consumer health care protections
before it adjourns this fall. This Health Care Bill of Rights should contain a range of protections,
including guaranteed access to needed health care specialists to ensure that patients are provided
appropriate high quality care, access to emergency room services when and where the need arises,
an assurance that medical records are confidential, and access to a meaningful internal and external
appeals process for consumers to resolve their differences with their health plans and health
care providers. The nation's health care system has changed dramatically, with more than 100
million Americans now in managed care plans. This legislation will ensure that whether
Americans have traditional health insurance or managed care, they are assured quality care.
And to ensure that new advances in genetics are used to improve health rather than to
discriminate, the President has called for legislation prohibiting the use of genetic screening to
discriminate in health insurance and employment.

Creating a Historic "21st Century Research Fund"

With Unprecedented Increases in Biomedical Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Scientists are on the cusp of important new breakthroughs in biomedical research, which could
revolutionize the way medical experts understand, treat, and prevent some of our most devastating
diseases. To promote this progress, the President's budget contains a historic upfront investment in
biomedical research -- a 1.15 billion increase in FY 1999 -- and proposes an increase in NIH funding
of more than 50 percent over the next five years. Under the President's proposal, the NIH will
devote over $20 billion to biomedical research in 2003.

Providing New Options for Americans Ages 55 to 65 to Obtain
Health Insurance, Including Buying Into Medicare

Americans ages 55 to 65 are one of the most difficult-to-insure populations: they have less access to
and a greater risk of losing employer-based health insurance; and they are twice as likely to have
health problems as the population generally. The President's proposal gives this vulnerable
population three new ways to gain access to health insurance by: (1) allowing Americans ages 62 to
65 to buy into Medicare, through톋 premium that ensures that this policy is self-financed; (2) assisting
vulnerable displaced workers 55 and over by offering those who have involuntarily lost their jobs and
health care coverage a similar Medicare buy-in option; and (3) giving Americans 55 and over who
have lost their retiree benefits access to their former employers' health insurance.

Passing Comprehensive Bipartisan Tobacco Legislation That Reduces Teen Smoking and
Changes the Way Tobacco Companies Do Business

Every day 3,000 young people start smoking and 1,000 of them will die prematurely from a
tobacco-related disease. The President called on Congress to pass comprehensive national bipartisan
legislation that includes five key principles: (1) it must mandate the development of a comprehensive
plan to reduce teen smoking, including raising the cost of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack over the next
10 years as necessary to meet youth smoking targets; (2) it must affirm the FDA's full authority to
regulate tobacco products; (3) it must include measures to hold tobacco companies accountable,
especially for marketing products to children; (4) it must include concrete measures to improve public
health, from investing in research to reducing second-hand smoke to expanding smoking cessation;
and (5) it must protect the financial well-being of tobacco farmers and their communities from the
loss of income caused by our efforts to reduce smoking.



CHILD CARE INITIATIVE

Double the Number of Children Receiving Child Care Subsidies
to More than Two Million

The President proposed to expand the Child Care and Development Block Grant to help
working families struggling to meet the costs of child care. This block grant is the primary
federal subsidy program to pay for child care, enabling low-income parents to work. Funds
are distributed by formula to the states to operate direct child care subsidy programs, as well as
to improve the quality and availability of care. The President's initiative will more than
double the number of children served from the one million served in FY 95 (the latest year for
which data are available). The President's budget will increase funding for the block grant by
$7.5 billion (plus a state match) over five years, which will enable states to provide subsidies for
more than two million children by 2003.

Increase Tax Credits for Child Care for Three Million Working Families

The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit provides tax relief to taxpayers who pay for the
care of a child under 13 or a disabled dependent or spouse in order to work. The credit is
equal to a percentage of the taxpayer's employment-related expenditures for child or
dependent care, with the amount of the credit depending on the taxpayer's income. The
President's proposal increases the credit for families earning under $60,000, providing an
additional average tax cut of $358 for these families and eliminating income tax liability for
almost all families with incomes below 200% of poverty ($35,000 for a family of four) that claim
the maximum allowable child care expenses. The President's budget will include $5.2 billion
over five years to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit for three million working
families.

The child care initiative includes a tax credit to businesses that provide child care services for
their employees, by building or expanding child care facilities, operating existing facilities,
training child care workers, or providing child care resources and referral services. The credit
covers 25% of qualified costs, but may not exceed $150,000 per year. The President's budget
will include approximately $500 million over five years for these tax credits.

Promote Early Learning

Research shows that children's experiences in the earliest years are critical to their
development and future success. The President's proposed Early Learning Fund provides
challenge grants to communities (distributed by states) to improve early learning and the
quality and safety of child care for children ages zero to five. Funds may be used for the
following activities: providing basic training to child care providers (including first aid and
CPR); corinecting individual child care providers to centers for education and support;
assisting child care providers to meet accreditation and licensing requirements; linking child
care providers with health professionals, and supporting the inclusion of young children with
special needs in quality child care settings; reducing group sizes and child-to-staff ratios; and
providing home visits, parent education, and consumer education about child care. The
President's Early Learning Fund builds on state initiatives such as North Carolina's Smart
Start, which helps North Carolina's children enter school healthy and ready to succeed. The
President's budget will include $3 billion over five years for this fund.

Increase Head Start and Double the Number of Children Served by Early Head Start

Head Start provides early, continuous and comprehensive child development and family support
services, preparing children for a lifetime of learning and development. The President's budget
will invest an additional $3.8 billion over five years to reach his goal of serving one million
children by 2002, and doubling the number of infants and toddlers in Early Head Start to
80,000.

Step Up Enforcement of State Health and Safety Standards

Building on the military's model child care program, this proposed initiative will fund state
efforts to improve licensing systems and enforce child care health and safety standards,
including by increasing unannounced inspections of child care settings. The President's
budget will include $500 million over five years for this program.

Facilitate Background Checks on Child Care Providers

On the day of the White House Conference on Child Care, the President transmitted to
background checks on child care providers by eliminating state law barriers to sharing
criminal history information for non-criminal purposes. Although the vast majority of child
care providers are dedicated to the teaching and nurturing of children, one tragedy in child
care is too many. Background checks are an important way to ensure that the people
watching our children are fit for this responsibility.
Increase Scholarships and Training for Child Care Providers

At the White House Conference on Child Care, the President proposed establishing a Child
Care Provider Scholarship Fund to enable states to provide scholarship funds to students
working toward a child care credential. Eligible child care workers must commit to remaining
in the field for at least one year for each year of assistance received and will earn increased
compensation or bonuses when they complete their course work. The President proposed a
federal investment of $250 million over five years, which will support 50,000 scholarships per
year. The President is also proposing to expand the Department of Labor's Child Care
Apprenticeship program to fund the training of child care providers.

Invest in Research

Because too little is known about our child care system, the President's budget will increase
support for data, research, and evaluation. This research fund will also support a National
Center on Child Care Statistics and a child care hotline that parents can call to get information
about how to find child care in their communities and how to identify appropriate, quality care
for their children. In addition, the research fund will support demonstration projects to test
approaches to help new parents who choose to stay home to care for their newborns or newly
adopted children. The President's budget will include $150 million over five years for this
fund.

Provides After-School Care for up to Half a Million Children a Year

The President proposes a dramatic expansion of the 21 st Century Community Learning Center
Program to provide start-up funds (with a local match) to school-community partnerships to establish
or expand before- and after-school programs for school-age children. The program increases the
supply of after-school care in a cost-effective manner by directing most funds to programs that use
public schools and their existing resources, such as computers, gymnasiums, and sports equipment.
The program also includes a set-aside to fund programs run by community organizations. The
President's budget will request $800 million of new money for this program, for a total of $1 billion
over five years.



CRIME

Juvenile Crime Strategy

This initiative recognizes the threat juvenile crime poses to our communities and calls on Congress to
targets gangs and violent juveniles by (1) funding for new prosecutors ($100 million) and probation
officers ($60 million); (2) helping our kids to stay gun- and drug-free by preventing violent juveniles
from buying guns when they turn 21; (3) enacting tough new sentences to punish adults who sell
drugs to kids and use kids to sell drugs; (4) helping kids to stay in school, off drugs, and out of
trouble with new funding to keep schools open later and to promote anti-truancy initiatives and curfews
($95 million). In addition, the President's Child Care Initiative increases five-fold current funding for
Department of Education-sponsored after school programs.

 AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD

 NATO Enlargement

 Europe's stability and America's security are closely linked. The President's call for enlarging the
 NATO alliance strengthens the alliance's core mission of collective defense and helps meet new
 threats such as regional instability.        Enlargement furthers other US objectives including:
 Encouraging states in the region to settle border and ethnic disputes with neighbors; strengthen
 civilian control of their militaries; and increase tolerance for ethnic and religious minorities.
 NATO's enlargement, combined with the Partnership for Peace program, the NATO-Russia Founding
 Act and the NATO-Ukraine partnership will help erase the outdated Cold War divisions and build,
 for the first time, an undivided, democratic, and peaceful Europe .

. Securing the Peace in Bosnia

 The United States has an abiding interest in peace and stability in Bosnia and a compelling interest in
 the implementation of the Dayton peace accords. After 46 months of the worst war in Europe since
 WWII, 24 months of implementing peace have helped put Bosnia on the path to lasting'peace and
 stability. Progress on implementation was made possible because of prudent military support. We
 can now see the point where civil implementation and peace can be self-sustaining -- but Bosnia's
 fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission
 ends in June. The President still must approve a detailed action plan being prepared by NATO
 military authorities after a full review of all options. The President will insist that this action plan
 have the following elements: an achievable mission tied to clear benchmarks, not a deadline; force
 must be able to protect itself; the U.S. must retain command; European allies must shoulder their
 full share of responsibility; costs must be manageable; and the plan must have substantial support of
 the Congress and the American people.

 Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction Program (WMD)

 President Clinton made clear that Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
 are unacceptable. U.N. inspectors have done a remarkable job -- destroying more of Iraq's WMD
 potential than was destroyed during the Gulf War itself. But Saddam is now refusing to allow
 inspectors to complete their mission. All options are on the table to make sure Iraq does not pursue
 their WMD program with impunity and threaten the international community.

President Clinton announced tonight that the United States would lead the effort to erect stronger
international barriers against the proliferation and use of biological weapons. Under this new
initiative, the United States will seek to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) by
requiring nations that have joined the BWC to submit annual declarations about facilities and
activities that could be used for Biological weapon purposes and agree to a tough international
inspection system including both voluntary and mandatory inspections.

Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

The President's call for Senate ratification of the CTBT will allow America to maintain a safe and
reliable nuclear deterrent while constraining the proliferation of nuclear material and technology to
rogue states' weapons programs. CTBT will improve America's ability to detect and deter nuclear
explosive testing. CTBT's global network of sensors will strengthen America's ability to monitor
nuclear explosive testing across the globe, as well as deter any nation from believing it can conduct a
nuclear explosive test undetected by the international community.

u.s. Arrears to the United Nations
The President also highlighted the need for prompt action on the payment of U.S. arrears to the
United Nations. The failure to pay undermines our ability to reform the U.N. and hinders our
leadership of that organization at very time the U.N. is working to prevent Iraq from threatening
neighbors and the world with weapons of mass destruction. We also need to give the International
Monetary Fund the capacity to' help prevent global financial crises. Now, more than ever, our
security at home and our interests abroad demand that America meet our international obligations,
sharpen the tools to improve the stability of the world economy, and increase our leverage in
international organizations.



A NATION THAT LIVES BY COMMUNITY


POLITICAL REFORMIREINVENTING GOVERNMENT

Free Television Time

Spending on congressional campaigns has increased more than three times the rate of inflation in the
last decades and spending on television is the primary reason. In 1972, candidates spent $25 million
for political ads; in 1996, they spent $400 million. In his State of the Union, President Clinton
announced that will request that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) require
broadcasters to give candidates for Federal office free time as a condition of receiving a new,
lucrative license for digital television. It is time to update broadcasters' public interest obligations to
meet new political and technological realities.             .

The President remains committed to the enactment of bipartisan campaign finance reform. He is
pleased that the leadership in Congress has agreed to schedule a vote this Spring on the
McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan reform bills. But a vote on these bills is not enough. In his
State of the Union the President challenged Congress to enact real reform this year. Acceptable
campaign finance reform legislation must meet five criteria: 1) it must be bipartisan; 2) it must be
comprehensive; 3) it must reduce the amount of money that is raised and spent on federal elections;
4) it must help level the playing field between challengers and incumbents; and 5) it cannot favor one
party over the other.
IRS Reform

President Clinton is strongly committed to reforming the IRS. This spring the Administration
will launch the first of 33 Citizen Advocacy Panels. These new panels will be locally-based,
independent boards of citizens established to monitor how local IRS offices treat taxpayers and
help taxpayers get their problems solved.        These new panels are part of the new era of
customer service underway at the IRS. The successful new IRS problem solving days, which
have helped thousands of taxpayers get relief, will continue around the country on a monthly
basis. Additionally, as of the first of the year, IRS phones are now operating 16 hours a day,
six days a week. For the first time, IRS offices will be open Saturday mornings during the tax
filing season -- March through mid-April -- to provide taxpayers a convenient opportunity to
walk-in and get any questions answered. Also, the IRS expects this year to expand its
award-winning Telefile program. This innovative program allowed 4.7 million taxpayers to
file their returns with a quick average 10 minute phone call last year.



COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

Since its creation in 1986, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) has given states tax
credits of $1.25 per capita to allocate to developers of affordable housing. Even though
building costs have increased 40 percent in the last decade, the amount of the credit has not
been adjusted for inflation. Therefore, President Clinton and Vice-President Gore propose to
increase the cap on the LIHTC from $1.25 per capita to $1.75 per capita - restoring the value
of the credit to its 1986 level. Estimates suggest that the LIHTC currently helps build
80,000-90,000 affordable housing units each year. The President and Vice President's
proposal to increase the cap by 40 percent will create an additional 160,000-180,000 new rental
housing units for low-income American families over the next five years. This proposal will
cost $1.6 billion over five years.

Empowerment Zones

Building on the Administration's successful first round of Empowerment Zones which has
helped spur the creation of jobs and private investment in America's distressed communities,
the President's budget includes a request for $1.7 billion to support flexible grants to 20 new
communities over a 10 year period. The 15 urban designations will be funded at $100 million
each; and the five rural designations will be funded at $40 million each. The Departments of
Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture will announce a competition this Spring that
will lead to the designation of the 20 new Empowerment Zones by December 1998.




"Play-by-the-Rules" Homeownership Proposal

The President's FY99 budget provides funds for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation
to start a new initiative to help provide the opportunity of homeownership to responsible
families with a perfect rental history. Under this initiative, we will help 10,000 lower-income --
and often minority -- families become homeowners. While the method of helping each family
buy their own home will differ, responsible families we will be provided homeownership
counseling, flexible assistance for down payment or closing costs, second mortgage loans for
debt reduction, or rehabilitation loans.

Homeownership Zones

The FY99 budget includes funds for Homeownership Zones to be used by communities to
reclaim abandoned and distressed neighborhoods through the creation of large-scale
developments of owner-occupied single-family homes. Funds could be used for property
acquisition, housing construction, housing rehabilitation, demolition, site preparation, homeownership
counseling, relocation, housing marketing, activities to ensure fair housing, and other activities
essential to homeowners hip.



ENVIRONMENT

Climate Change Initiative

Following the historic agreement reached in Kyoto in December 1997, and as part of the
President's and Vice President's ongoing efforts to address climate change, the President is
proposing a dramatic new program of tax cuts and R&D aimed at cutting greenhouse gas
emissions. The proposed package contains tax cuts to promote energy efficiency and
additional research and development spending covering the four major carbon-emitting sectors
of the economy (buildings, industry, transportation, and electricity), plus carbon removal and
sequestration, Federal facilities, and cross-cutting analyses and research. This package
complements the other elements of the Administration's climate change plan, which include
working with industry to develop sector-by-sector initiatives to cut emissions, incorporating
energy efficiency goals into Federal procuremenf and energy use, and restructuring the
efficiency and reducing costs to the consumer. They provide a solid step on the way to meeting
the goals of the Kyoto Agreement.

Clean Water Initiative

This initiative will ease threats to the environment and public health by helping states and
communities curb polluted runoff from farms and city streets, reducing exposure to harmful
organisms and toxic contaminants in drinking water and fish, and promoting community-based
watershed management in partnership with landowners and affected industries. The initiative targets
the 40 percent of the nation's waterways still unsafe for fishing and swimming. It provides substantial
new resources to assist states in implementing these programs and to create incentives for farmers to
adopt practices that protect water quality.

Food Safety Initiative

The Clinton Administration launched a new food safety initiative last year to put in place new
science-based preventive systems to improve the safety of seafood, meat, and poultry and begin work
on a new early warning system to help detect and respond to outbreaks of food borne illness. Our
budget will seek an even more substantial increase in funding to further enhance food safety. The
resources will go to a variety of initiatives, including: giving FDA authority.to prevent the
importation of produce from countries without safety precautions equivalent to our own; hiring FDA
inspectors to improve the safety of fruits and vegetables, both domestic and imported; developing
new ways for federal inspectors to detect food borne illnesses in meat and poultry and determine the
source of contamination; improving educational outreach on proper food handling; and further
expanding our early warning system and strengthening state surveillance activities for foodborne
illnesses.


CIVIL RIGHTS

Reforming and Strengthening the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC)

This initiative expands the EEOC's ADR program over three years to allow as many as 70 percent of
all complainants to choose mediation, rather than the lengthy process of investigation and litigation.
In the first year, the EEOC will provide ADR in a projected 16,000 cases -- 20 percent of all
incoming cases and double the number currently sent to mediation. In addition, through a
combination of increased use of mediation, improved information technology, and an expanded
investigative staff, the EEOC will reduce the average time it takes to resolve a private sector
complaint from over 9 months to 6 months, and reduce the backlog of cases from 64,000 to 28,000 by
the year 2000. The proposal provides $279 million for the EEOC for FY99 -- $37 million or 15
percent more than the enacted 1998 budget.



    THE MILLEN/UM PROJECT

    TECHNOLOGY

    A Family-Friendly Internet

    President Clinton and Vice President Gore support a strategy to protect children and create a
    safe, educational environment on the Internet that is consistent with our First Amendment
    values. This strategy includes cracking down on obscenity, child pornography, and online
    stalking, and encouraging the private sector to develop filtering and blocking technology for
    parents and teachers that is widely available and effective. This fall, the Administration will
    join the private sector and non-profit groups to support "Internet Teach-Ins" at schools and
    libraries, which are designed to increase awareness of safe on-line behavior for children and
    access to good content.

    Making the Internet a Global Free-Trade Zone

    The Administration is committed to creating an environment in which global electronic
    commerce can flourish, so that every computer will be a window open to every business, large
    and small. Over the next several years, Internet commerce could increase to hundreds of
    billions of dollars per year, boosting U.S. exports and creating new opportunities for small
    start-up companies. President Clinton has directed the U.S. Trade Representative to work
    with foreign governments to secure agreement that all products and services delivered across
    the Internet and all equipment from which the Internet is built -- be free from tariffs.

    Cloning

    President Clinton has proposed legislation banning the cloning of human beings. The
    President's legislative proposal prohibits for five years the use of somatic cell nuclear
    technology to create a human being. The legislation directs the National Bioethics Advisory
    Commission to report to the President in four and half years on whether to continue the ban.
    The proposal is carefully worded to ensure that it will not interfere with beneficial biomedical
    and agricultural activities. In March 1997, the President imposed a ban on the use of federal
    money for cloning human beings.

    Save America's Treasures

    Many of our most important cultural treasures -- such as the Star Spangled Banner, the Declaration of
    Independence, and the Bill of Rights -- are seriously at risk. "Save America's Treasures" is a three
    year, $150 million initiative that will help stimulate support for the Nation's most important
    preservation priorities. The funds will be administered by the Department of Interior under the
    authority of the National Historic Preservation Act. Half of the money will support preservation
    projects identified at the nationallevel-- the other half will go to support state and local priorities.
