TEXT:
Attached is OPM's analysis regarding implementing comparable worth for the
federal government. They do not recommend it because they are currently
in the process of revamping the federal compensation system and a
comparable worth analysis would delay that process.  Rather, they suggest
a Presidential directive to OPM to consider pay equity issues in the
design of the new compensation system.

         Feasibility of OPM Conducting a Comparable Worth Study
                         for the Federal Government

1.   What would conducting a comparable worth study entail?

      Typical activities include: (1) collecting general information about wage gaps; (2)
     examining the compensation of job classes; (3) locating sex-bias within classification!
     compensation systems; and (4) determining the magnitude of sex-bias. Studies usually
     involve both a consulting firm and in-house staff.

2.   Who would probably be involved in conducting the study?

           Steering Committee.
           In-house Federal employees (OPM, major agencies, etc.)
           Outside Consultants.

3.   What is the possible maximum scope of the study?

     As of September 1998, the 1.8 million nonpostal Executive Branch employees were paid
     under 129 different pay plans administered by 25 different agencies. (The 129 pay plans
     can be grouped into over 60 "pay systems.")

4.   What policy issues would affect the cost?

           Deciding on a precise goal or goals for the study.
           Determining what pay systems will be included in the study.
           Deciding how jobs and/or job incumbents will be selected for study.
           Deciding what general type of job evaluation will be used, and within each category,
            what particular system seems most appropriate.
           Determining what analytic technique will be used to interpret the study results.

5.   How long to we estimate it would take?

     We estimate it would take between 18 months to 2 years to complete a study.

           State-conducted studies generally took 18 months or less to complete.
           Experts recommend that pay equity studies be conducted quickly, preferably less that
            18 months.
           Longer studies can result in documentation for jobs analyzed early in the process
            becoming out of date before the study is completed.

                                                                                           March 9, 1999

                                                                                                                          2

6.    Based on state government study costs, how much do we estimate a Federal
      government study cost

              Average Cost $9,778,000 (range--$3,640,000 to 17,714,000
              Costs can vary substantially based on the scope and complexity of the study.



 NOTES:
          I.    State study costs were aged to reflect 1999 dollars. The Consumer Price Index-All Urban
                Consumers (CPI-U) for January 1985 (105.5) and for January 1999 (164.3) were used to calculate
                a multiplier. This multiplier (1.5573459) was then used to adjust the cost of each study (using a
                January 1985 common date).

          2.    Federal Government cost projections (4) were estimated using the ratio between the number of
                employees for each individual state and the Federal Government (based on 1995 data). Average
                cost reflects the average of the four cost projections. Cost range reflects the lowest and the higher .
                cost projections.




7.    OPM recommendations

      OPM does not recommend undertaking a comparable worth study in the Federal government
      at this time.

              Past studies on pay equity in the Federal government have found no clear evidence
               that any major systemic problems exist.

              OPM is in the process of conducting a total review and revamping of the current
               Federal compensation system to achieve a modernized performance-oriented system
               of total compensation. The target date for completion is the year 2002. It would
               not make sense to conduct a 2-year comparable worth study on a compensation
               system which will likely be completely changed by the time the study is completed.

              OPM's FY 2000 budget request does not include the approximately $10 million
               dollars it would cost to undertake this study.

      ~        OPM, instead, recommends that the President direct us to include a review of
                                          comparable worth, and an assurance of gender equity,
                                          in the design of the Federal government's new
                                          compensation system. (Specific language can be
                                          worked out if this proposal is accepted.)
