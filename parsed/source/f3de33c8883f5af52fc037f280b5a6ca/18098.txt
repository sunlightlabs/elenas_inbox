RE:            Options for INS Reform


        We have done a very brief summary of the major INS refonn proposals and provided an
outline of the broad options which integrates aspects of the different proposals (as well as other
infonnal suggestions that were made during our meetings) as a thinkpiece for you.


PROPOSAL SUMMARIES

Commission on Immigration Reform. The Commission on Immigration Refonn (CIR)
proposes significant structural refonn to immigration operations. In its final report, the CIR
proposed to eliminate the INS and restructure the immigration system into four main operations:

·      Immigration Enforcement: All immigration enforcement (e.g., Border Patrol, inspectors,
       investigators) at both the border and the interior would be moved into a newly created
       Bureau of Immigration Enforcement and the Department of Justice.

·      Immigration Services: The Department of State would assume responsibility for
       adjudication of all immigration-related applications, including immigrant, limited
       duration admissions (e.g., tourist, student visas), asylum/refugees and naturalizations.
       All immigration functions would fall under the jurisdiction of a new Undersecretary for
       Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Admissions.

·      Worksite Enforcement: All responsibility for enforcement of immigration-related
       standards for employers would be housed at the Department of Labor. This would .
       include enforcing employer sanctions against employers who fail to venfy 1-9 fonns for
       work authorization and monitoring compliance with employer attestations to sponsor
       skill-based immigrants.

·      Immigration Review: An independent body within the Executive Branch would be
       created to hear appeals of immigration-related administrative decisions, including
       removal (e.g., deportation) hearings. Decisions by the appellate body would be binding
       over the Executive Branch. Only the federal courts and Congress would have the
       authority to reverse.
                                                                   Hdx-Dump Conversion
Reyes Bill

·      The Reyes proposed legislation, "The Border Security Enforcement Act of 1997," would
       make a significant structural change to INS by putting its entire enforcement component
       into a newly-created agency within the Department of Justice. The Director ofthe new
       Office of Enforcement and Border Affairs would report directly to the Attorney General.
       All enforcement, including Border Patrol, detention, deportations, inspections,
       intelligence, and investigations, would be moved to the new agency. INS would
       continue all remaining non-enforcement functions.


INS' Reorganization Proposal. The INS proposal would reorganize their existing structure
and contains various management r.efonns.

·     Separation of Enforcement and Services: The INS plan is focused on reengineering their
      delivery of services and moving toward a customer-service orientation. To this end, the
      INS plan would create a clearer delineation between enforcement and service functions
      by physically separating the functions at the district office level. Services staff and
      enforcement staff would trained separately. This would also mean that individuals
      seeking services from INS would never come into physical contact with enforcement
      officers when entering district offices.

·      Infrastructure Improvements: The INS plan focuses on making significant enhancements
       to technology, including the centralization and automation of INS records, in order to
       improve both delivery of services and law enforcement needs.

·     Management Refonns: The INS plan would overhaul career development systems, and
      address longstanding pay issues to improve standards of professionalism within the
      Service.


OMB Proposal. The OMB proposal, similar to the INS proposal, retains current INS functions
within the Service.

·     Separation of Enforcement and Services: The OMB proposal would reorganize INS and
      create two Executive Associate Commissioners (EACs): one for enforcement and one for
      services and benefits. The EACs would report directly to the Deputy Commissioner.
      The Enforcement EAC would be responsible for all of INS' enforcement agents -- which
      OMB recommends merging into one unifonn service and a white collar investigate
      service (CIR proposal). The EAC for Services would be responsible for regional service
      centers, foreign operations for refugees/asylees and all existing district office operations.

·     INS Headquarters Reorganization: Headquarters would be focused on policy, strategic
      planning and management, budget, and compliance with policy and procedures.
                                                                  Hex-Dump COi1v~i5ion

OPTIONS OUTLINE

As the outline below reveals, there are many ways that the various proposals could be combined.
 We have used three very broad categories as a guide to thinking about the issues: reforms within
INS; reforms that involve changes within the Department of Justice structure; and reforms that
impact other agencies.


I.     Reform that would keep all functions within INS.

       A.     Separate enforcement from services -- from field up to Headquarters.

               1.     Create two Deputy Commissioners, with two separate lines of authority
                      and chains of command: one with responsibility for enforcement and the
                      other for services.

                      a.     Could organize the enforcement side more like a police
                             department: start as a border patrol agent (beat cop), move up to an
                             investigator (detective) and further potential to move up in the
                             chain of command to Headquarters.

                             1.      Would address the concern that the border patrol agents are
                                     too isolated from the rest of enforcement, which creates the
                                     perception of lack of accountability.

                             11.     Could create a more substantial career path for agents,
                                     resulting in lower turnover and greater professionalism.

                      b.     Would create a direct line of authority between Headquarters and
                             district offices, providing for greater accountability that many say
                             is lacking under the current system.

                      c.     Would allow for the creation of a more regional model for location
                             of all enforcement resources (i.e., Southwest Border emphasis) and
                             a more community-based model for services.

              2.     Create two Executive Associate Commissioners-- one for services and one
                     for enforcement. Resulting stovepipe structure for all enforcement and
                     service functions could be same as above but would merge at the Deputy
                     Commissioner's office.
       B.     Separate enforcement from services at district office level only.


                                               3
                                                                   Hex-Dump COilil.:;'sion ·

               1.     Split enforcement from service functions at the field level, though keep the
                      functions integrated at the regional office level and above.

              2.      This option is favored by INS.

In addition, under either model, could better integrate the Border Patrol in the chain of command
within enforcement, to address the issue of increasing alienation ofthe Border Patrol from the
rest of INS. Also, could move law enforcement within INS up to the level (training, pay, etc.) of
other law enforcement agencies with the DOJ. In addition, under either model could re-cast
inspections as an enforcement function.


II.    Reform that would keep all functions within the DOJ, but move some out of INS.

       A.     Move enforcement from INS to Main Justice

               1.     Would better integrate the Border patrol into the Justice enforcement
                      structure, and may result in improved professionalism and retention.

              2.      Would require costly changes in salary structure.

              3.      John Morton from DOJ informed us that Justice is generally reluctant to
                      create another law enforcement sub-agency. Other Justice law
                      enforcement agencies (e.g., FBI, DEA) may also resist.

       B.     Create a high-level person at the Department of Justice to handle immigration
              (e.g., an Assistant Attorney General for Immigration).

              1.      Could help make DOJ more institutionally responsive to immigration
                      issues.

              2.      INS argues this would actually weaken stature of immigration function
                      since Commissioner now reports directly to the Deputy Attorney General.

       C.     Consolidate administrative review within EOIR at Justice.

               1.     Under the current system, there are several discreet administrative review
                      functions being performed by INS and Labor.

III.   Reforms that impact other agencies

       Any of the following reforms but the first could be done in conjunction with a


                                               4
restructuring within the INS or within DOJ.                     Hex-Dump COllv.:.;"sion .

A.     State Department

       1.     The creation of an Undersecretary for Migration at the State Department
              who would head an office in charge of virtually all immigration services--
              visas, adjustment of status, naturalization, labor certification, etc.

              a.      Strongly opposed by advocates, INS, and DOJ.

              b.      Strong reservations raised by State Department.

       2.     State Department to perform all of the refugee applications overseas.

              a.      Strongly opposed by advocates. Apparently, it has been a long
                      fight to get State out of this process, because of years of
                      politicization (see, e.g., Central Americans).


       3.     Scale back the Department of State's role in the processing of petitions for
              non-immigrant visas.

              a.      Under the current system, State often re-adjudicates the application
                      instead of just checking Interpol and possible foreign policy
                      concerns. Instead, INS could control the process, but consult with
                      State for the limited purpose of international checks.

B.     Labor Department

       I.     Empower Labor to sanction employers for 1-9 violations, rather than
              simply referring to INS, where there is little follow through.

              a.      Concern about protections for undocumented workers who report
                      labor violations.

              b.      Concern that fear of deportation could chill the reporting of poor
                      labor standards, which adversely affects all workers.

       2.     Move labor certification out ofthe Labor Department to INS (or State, if
              they are handling naturalization and visas).

              a.      Many criticize Labor for taking too long to process a labor
                      certification, which then forces employers to hire workers with


                                        5
                                                        Hex-Dump Convd!'Sion

                   temporary visas until the paperwork is completed.

            b.     Labor believes that the link between employment-based
                   immigration-and the labor market supports the continued use of
                   some sort of labor market test in deciding whether an employer is
                   permitted to import a foreign worker.

     3.     Consolidate all non-immigrant visa programs and give them all a set of
            labor standards that the Department of Labor could enforce.

            a.     Could include making legal hiring a labor standard, enforced by the
                   DOL as part of their general review of employers for compliance
                   with other labor standards (minimum wage laws; equal pay for
                   equal work; etc.)

C.   Create an independent agency to handle all administrative appeals.

     1.     According to John Morton, strongly opposed by the DOJ. They do not
            want to diminish the Executive's adjudicative and policy-making role.

D.   Remove INS from the process of determining employment-based immigration
     (leaving decision to Labor and State).

E.   Create a permanent office at the White House to handle the various migration
     issues on a more global policy level.
