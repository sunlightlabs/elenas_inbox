                  THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES EQUAL PAY
        INITIATIVE AND URGES PASSAGE OF PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT

In his weekly radio address, the President announced that he will include a new $14 million
EquaJPay Initiative as part of his Fiscal Year 2000 budget, and urged prompt passage of
the Paycheck Fairness Act. The Initiative includes $10 million for the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to improve training for EEOC employees to better
identify wage discrimination issues, increase technical assistance to businesses, and launch
an equal pay public service announcement campaign. The Department of Labor will
receive $4 million, including funds for a program to assist contractors in recruiting and
retaining qualified women in non-traditional occupations. The President also again called
on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act which would improve the enforcement of
wage discrimination laws and provide for research, training of EEOC staff, and public
education efforts on this important subject.

Equal Pay Initiative

The President's FY2000 budget includes funding for a $14 million equal pay initiative for
the EEOC and the DOL's Office of Federal Contractor Compliance (OFCCP):

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
The President's FY2000 budget includes $10 million for the EEOC which will:

      provide training for EEOC enforcement staff in identifying wage discrimination cases;

      provide training and technical assistance to approximately 3,000 employers; and

      develop public service announcements to educate employees and employers on the
       importance of this issue as well as their rights and responsibilities.

The Department of Labor
The President's FY2000 budget includes $4 million for the Labor Department's Office of Federal
Contract Compliance Programs which will:

      help women obtain and retain employment in non-traditional jobs by identifying model
       employer practices and assisting contractors in identifying resources, including linking
       them with the new Workforce Investment Act system; and

      increase outreach, education, and technical assistance to employers on equal pay issues,
       by providing guidelines and industry best practices via the Internet.

Paycheck Fairness Act

The President again urged Congress to pass legislation called the "The Paycheck Fairness Act,"
introduced by Senator Daschle, to strengthen laws prohibiting wage discrimination. The
highlights of this legislation include:

      Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The legislation adds full compensatory
       and punitive damages as remedies, in addition to the liquidated damages and back pay
                                                               Hex-Dwnp Conversion
    awards currently available under the EPA. This proposal would put gender-based wage
    discrimination on equal footing with wage discrimination based on race or ethnicity, for
    which uncapped compensatory and punitive damages are already available.

   Non-retaliation provision. The bill would prohibit employers from punishing employees
    for sharing salary information with their co-workers. Currently, many employers are free
    to take action against employees who share wage information. Without the ability to
    learn about wage disparities, it is difficult for women to evaluate whether there is wage
    discrimination.

   Training, Research, and Pay Equity Award. This bill provides for increased training for
    Equal Employment Opportunity Commission employees to identify wage discrimination
    claims; research on discrimination in the payment of wages; and the establishment
    of an award which will recognize and promote the achievements of employers that
    have made strides to eliminate pay disparities.
               1998 Clinton Administration Accomplishments on Equal Pllfx-DumP Conversion

The President's announcement builds on a strong record of fighting to end wage discnmination.
Last year, the Administration supported legislation to strengthen penalties for wage
discrimination, provided technical assistance to employers, and released two new studies
documenting the scope of the problem.

          Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) Report on the Wage Gap. The
          President announced a report by the CEA that shows that a significant gap
          between the wages of women and men remains today although it has
          narrowed substantially since the signing of the Equal Pay Act. In 1963, the
          year that the Equal Pay Act was signed, women earned 58 cents for every
          dollar men earned. Today, women earn about 75 cents for every dollar men
          ,earn --a 29-percent increase over the 1963 levels. The gender gap has
          narrowed faster among younger women and among married women with
          children. And relative to all male workers, wage gains have been faster for
          black and white women than for Hispanic women.

           Department of Labor Report With a Historical Perspective on the Wage
           Gap. The Department of Labor produced a report that provides a
           thirty-five year perspective on the wage gap. This report focuses on three
           periods since the signing of the Equal Pay Act --1960-1975, 1975-1985, and
           1985-1997 --and highlights the increased participation of women in the labor
           force, the changing occupations of women, and the emergence of more
           women-owned businesses.

           10-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Businesses and Employees. To help
           employers who would like to improve their pay and hiring practices, DOL
           put on its website a 10-step package that gives companies guidelines in
           determining whether they offer equal pay, hiring, and promotional
           opportunities. A similar checklist for employees, to help them determine if
           they are being paid equitably, is also on DOL's website.

           Guide to Recruitment and Retention of Women in the Federal Government.
           OPM published a new Guide on Recruitment and Retention of Women in the
           Federal Government which contains information to make agency managers
           aware of career opportunities for women and to provide guidance on
           recruitment and career development for women.

           Federal Contractor Best Practices.   DOL publicized successful steps that
           employers have used to promote best practices in compensation on DOL's web
           site.
                                                                               Records Management System
                                                                    . \ I:l()mated

                          Questions And Answers on Equal Pay
                                    January 29, 1999

Q:   What did the President announce today?

A:   In his weekly radio address, the President announced a new $14 million Equal Pay
     Initiative as part of his Fiscal Year 2000 budget, and urged prompt passage of the
     Paycheck Fairness Act. The Initiative includes $10 million for the Equal
     Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to improve training for EEOC
     employees to better identify wage discrimination issues, increase technical assistance
     to businesses, and launch an equal pay public service announcement campaign.
     The Department of Labor will receive $4 million, including funds for a program to
     assist contractors in recruiting and retaining qualified women for non-traditional
     occupations. The President also again called on Congress to pass the Paycheck
     Fairness Act which would improve the enforcement of wage discrimination laws and
     provide for research, training of EEOC staff, and public outreach on this important
     subject.

Q:   How large is the wage gap?

A:   According to the Department ofthe Labor, in 1997 the average woman who worked
     full-time eamedjust 74 cents for each dollar that men earned based on annual earnings.
     For women of color, the gap was even wider. On average, black women earned only 60
     cents, and Hispanic women earned only 52 cents for each dollar earned by non-Hispanic
     white men. In 1998, based on weekly earnings, women earned 76 cents for every dollar
     men earned. Annual earnings are not yet available for 1998. Some wage differences
     exist due to differing levels of experience, education, and skill. However, studies show
     that even accounting for differences in education, experience, and occupation, there is
     still a significant wage differential for women.

Q:   What will EEOC do with the new funding?

A:   The President's FY2000 budget includes $10 million for the EEOC which will: (1)
     provide training for EEOC enforcement staff in identifying wage discrimination cases; (2)
     provide training and technical assistance to employers; and (3) develop public service
     announcements to educate employees and employers on the importance of this issue as
     well as their rights and responsibilities. With this funding, EEOC will be able to provide
     direct technical assistance to approximately 3000 employers, and will be able to reach
     tens ofthousands of employers through its PSA campaign.

Q:   What will the Department of Labor do with the new funding?

A:   The President's FY2000 budget includes $4 million for the Labor Department's Office of

                                                                               Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dwnp Conversion

      Federal Contract Compliance Programs which will: (1) help women obtain and retain
      employment in non-traditional jobs by identifying model employer practices and assisting
      contractors in identifying resources, including linking them with the new Workforce
      Investment Act system; and (2) increase outreach, education, and technical assistance to
      employers on equal pay issues by providing guidelines and industry best practices via the
      Internet.

Q:    What activities do OFCCP and EEOC currently undertake regarding the
      enforcement of wage discrimination?

A:    OFCCP enforces the anti-discrimination and affirmative action executive order that
      requires employers doing business with the government to apply their compensation
      practices in a non-discriminatory manner. OFCCP also conducts compliance evaluations
      and complaint investigations, and glass ceiling reviews, which are reviews designed to
      focus on the identification and removal of artificial barriers to the advancement of
      qualified women and minorities in Federal contractor workplaces. Currently, the EEOC
      investigates a little over one thousand charges each year involving equal pay claims in the
      private sector, brings charges against severe violators of the law, and provides limited
      technical assistance on equal pay issues.

Paycheck Fairness Act

Q:    What does the Paycheck Fairness Act do?

A:    The legislation, sponsored by Senator Daschle, seeks to improve the enforcement of wage
      discrimination laws and to strengthen the remedy provisions in the Equal Pay Act by
      permitting victims of wage discrimination to seek compensatory and punitive damages.
      Currently, women who are the victims of wage discrimination receive only backpay and
      liquidated damages, which may not fully compensate them for their loss. This change
      will mean that the penalties for sex-based wage discrimination will be the same as those
      for race-based wage discrimination. In addition, the legislation contains a non-retaliation
      provision that prohibits employers from penalizing employees for sharing information
      about their salaries with co-workers. Finally, the bill provides for training for EEOC
      employees on matters involving the discrimination of wages, research on discrimination
      in the payment of wages, and the establishment of an award which will recognize
      and promote the achievements of employers that have made strides to eliminate pay
      disparities.

Q:    What's wrong with the current scheme for collecting damages under the Equal Pay
      Act?

A:    Currently, the EPA allows only for liquidated damages and backpay awards. Liquidated
      damages usually are awarded in an amount equal to backpay. Such awards may not fully
      compensate a woman for real losses, such as damages for pain and suffering. In


                                              2
                                                                             Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dwnp Conversion

      addition, women cannot receive punitive damages for wage discrimination, no matter
      how intentional and egregious the employer's conduct. The legislation the
      Administration is endorsing will ensure that women are fully compensated when an
      employer discriminates against them in setting wages.

Q:    What is the Administration doing with respect to data collection?

A:    The endorsed legislation contains a Sense of the Senate that the President should take
      appropriate steps to increase the amount of information available with respect to wage
      disparities, while maximizing the utility of the data and protecting individuals' privacy
      and minimizing burdens on reporting entities. In addition, the Administration previously
      announced an annual report on the pay gap, by sex, to be produced by the Department of
      Labor. This easy-to-access report will raise the national prominence of wage disparities
      and will highlight the issue every year in order to spur Americans to achieve increased
      equal pay.

Q:    Is the Administration's policy on uncapped punitive and compensatory damages
      consistent with its position in other areas of the law such as tort reform?

A:    Yes, this is consistent with Administration's position on tort reform. Our proposals on
      tort reform have never sought to cap compensatory damages, which are necessary to
      remedy actual harm. And except in very exceptional circumstances, we have approved
      the use of punitive damage awards to deter intentional misconduct.

Q:    Why isn't the Administration supporting comparable worth?

A:    The Daschle bill is a significant step forward in solving the problem of unequal pay. The
      Administration believes there is no excuse for not taking these obvious steps towards
      providing better training and fuller remedies to help ensure women receive equal pay,
      while building a consensus on other ways to make sure every person receives the pay they
      deserve. The Administration is focusing on legislation that can be passed during this
      congressional session.

Questions on the Federal Work Force

Q:    What are some of the specific accomplishments of the Clinton Administration with
      respect to women appointees?

A:    Here are some specific accomplishments:

      Appointed More Women than Any Other President --40 percent of Administration
      appointees are women.
      Women Hold 29 Percent of the Top Positions --29 percent of the positions requiring
      Senate confirmation (PAS) are held by women. Additionally,


                                             3
                                                                       Hex-Dwnp Conversion

     <       35 percent of Presidential appointments, including boards and commissions, are
             held by women.
     ~       40 percent of non-career Senior Executive Service positions are held by women.
     ~       56 percent of Schedule C positions are held by women.
     Appointed the First Women Ever to Serve as Attorney General, Janet Reno, and
     Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. Including the Attorney General and Secretary
     of State, women make up 32 percent of the Clinton Cabinet: Alexis Herman, Secretary
     of Labor; Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services; Carol Browner,
     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Janet Yellen, Chair of the
     Council of Economic Advisors; and Charlene Barshefsky, United States Trade
     Representative all serve in the President's Cabinet.
     30 Percent of All of the President's Judicial Nominees Are Women.
     Nominated the Second Woman to Serve on the Supreme Court. During his first
     year in office, President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the United States
     Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg is only the second woman to serve on the nation's
     highest court.

Q:   What is the representation of women in the federal work force?

A:   Women represented 42.9 percent of the Federal permanent workforce in 1998 compared
     to 46.3 percent of the Civilian Labor Force, a difference of a -3.4 percentage points.

Q:   What is the average salary of female political employees versus that of male
