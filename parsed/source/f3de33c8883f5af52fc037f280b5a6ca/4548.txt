                         FAIR HOUSING INITIATIVES PROGRAM

                                    1997 GRANT AWARDS


DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM
The Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) provides support to private non-profit organizations, State and local
governments and others to strengthen enforcement of, and enhance compliance with, the
Nation's fair housing laws. FHIP was authorized by the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1987. While both education and enforcement efforts are supported by FHIP grants, the
major thrust ofthe program is the support to private, non-profit fair housing enforcement
organizations to undertake testing and other enforcement activities to prevent and eliminate
discriminatory housing practices.

1997 GRANT AWARD COMPETITION
In fiscal year 1997, $15 million is being made available for grants in three categories:

      Private Enforcement Initiative -- ($10.2 million)-- to enforcement organizations that
       receive grants to investigate allegations of housing discrimination, provide housing
       counseling and work to promote fair housing.

      Fair Housing Organizations Initiative -- ($2.7 million) -- to help organizations build
       their capacity to undertake fair housing enforcement activities. Approximately $1.3
       million of these funds have been designated to help disability advocacy organizations.

      Education and Outreach Initiative -- ($1.8 million) -- projects funded in this category
       include those that seek to promote reconciliation in communities experiencing racial
       tensions -- for example, those that occur when African-American and Latino with
       Section 8 housing vouchers move outside the inner cities.

OVERVIEW OF GRANT AWARDS

      A total of 67 awards will be made, totaling $15 million.

      Awards in 33 states and the District of Columbia, with at least 2 private enforcement
       initiative awards in every HUD region in the country.

       fair housing enforcement organizations, housing industry groups, community groups,
       disability advocacy groups, city governments, fair housing agencies, legal service
       agencies and community development corporations.
                                                                     , , moted Records Management System

                  FAIR HOUSING: ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION
                AND REDUCING BARRIERS TO CREATE ONE AMERICA


As we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out. We must continue to enforce fair
lending andfair housing and all civil rights laws, because America will never be complete in its renewal
until everyone shares in its bounty.
                                         President Clinton, State of The Union Address, January 25, 1994

Today President Clinton attended the second meeting of his Race Advisory Panel and announced
a three-part initiative to eradicate housing discrimination: (1) doubling the number of
enforcement actions against housing discrimination; (2) giving new grants to help private
non-profit groups, state and local governments and others to eliminate housing discrimination;
and (3) filing civil charges in three housing discrimination cases.

PRESIDENT CLINTON DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN
DEVELOPMENT TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS
AGAINST HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. Under President Clinton's leadership, the rate
of home ownership in America is approaching the highest in our history -- we are one-tenth of
one percentage point away. Minority homebuyers account for a large (29%) and growing share
of these new homeowners. Unfortunately, as the rate of minority participation in housing has
increased, so have complaints of housing discrimination. Over the past four years, there have
been more than 34,000 complaints of housing discrimination made to federal, state and local
agencices. The Clinton administration is committed to eliminate barriers to home ownership
and allow even more Americans to own homes in safe and affordable communities. Today, the
President directed the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to double the number of
enforcement actions against housing discrimination in the next four years to help eliminate
housing discrimination.

PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES $15 MILLION IN GRANTS TO ENFORCE
FAIR HOUSING LAWS. These grants-- a total of 67 awards -- are going to 33 states, and the
District of Columbia to support the efforts of private non-profit organizations, state and local
governments, disability advocacy groups, community development corporations and others to
enhance compliance with the Nation's fair housing laws. Grants will be used for both education
and enforcement efforts -- including funding for enforcement organizations that undertake
testing, and provide housing counseling and other activities to prevent and eliminate
discriminatory housing practices and promote fair housing.

CIVIL CHARGES FILED IN THREE CASES OF ALLEGED ILLEGAL HOUSING
DISCRIMINATION. Today HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo announced that the Department
of Housing and Urban Development will file civil charges of housing discrimination against
three individuals and one business under the Fair Housing Act -- which bars discrimination in the
sale, rental, financing and advertising of almost all housing in the nation on account of race,
color, religion sex, disability, family status and national origin. The actions today send a
message that the Administration will continue to vigorously enforce our nation's fair housing
laws.
