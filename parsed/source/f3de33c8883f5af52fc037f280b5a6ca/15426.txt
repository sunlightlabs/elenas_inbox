SECTION III.          GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.     Balanced Budget. PL 104-8 requires that the District balance its budget by FY1999.
       By this agreement, the District agrees to present and/or approve a balanced budget for the
       Fiscal Year beginning October 1, 1997.

2.     Agreement to be Bound. The Distriet agrees ta be bauRd by aad ta use its affiees aad
       best efferts ta implemeRt this agreemeRt.


SECTION IV. SUBMISSION OF LEGISLATION &                             FEDERALLY ASSUMED
FUNCTIONS

        As Chair of the President's District of Columbia Task Force, the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget intends to recommend the submission of legislation to the Congress
that is consistent with the National Capital Revitalization and Self Government Improvement
Plan (the "Plan") announced by the President on January 14, 1997.

        Once implemented, the Plan will provide the District substantial relief from its operating
expenditures, relief which will grow over time. It will also invest considerable resources to
improve the District's criminal justice systems and capital infrastructure. If this legislation is
enacted, the Federal government will undertake the functions described below. The Federal
government will not undertake a function until the District government meets the conditions for
that function, described in Section V.

1.     Medicaid. The Federal government will increase its share of the District's Medicaid
       payments to 70 percent, thereby reducing the District's share to 30 percent. The
       Department of Health and Human Services will continue to provide more intensive


                                                5

                             Hex-Dump Conversion
     program.

2.   Pensions. The Federal government will take financial and administrative
     responsibility for virtually all pension benefits accrued under the plans for all active
     and retired police and firefighters, and teachers, and will take full responsibility for
     the pensions of judges. The bulk of the assets of the retirement plans will be
     transferred to the Federal government and placed with a third party Trustee chosen by the
     Secretary of the Treasury. A significant amount of assets will be left with the District of
     Columbia to fund the benefits of participants in the District's plans and to rednce the
     District's annual contribution. The Trustee will invest funds, manage the existing
     plans, and make payments on behalf of beneficiaries. The Federal government will
     pledge its full faith and credit to meet its responsibilities to pay these benefits. Current
     retirees will have all their benefits paid by the Federal government. Retirement, death,
     and some disability benefits payable by the Federal government to current employees will
     be based on service earned as of the date the legislation is introduced. While the Federal
     government will not be responsible for benefits earned during future years of service by
     members of the current retirement programs (other than judges), these members will get
     the benefit of pay increases on the frozen benefits. Frozen benefits will continue to be
     subject to cost-of-living adjustments under the terms of the existing programs. All future
     employee contributions (except for judges) will be paid into the new plans.

3.   Treasury Loans to Eliminate the Deficit. The United States Treasury will provide loans
     of up to IS-year terms to assist the District to eliminate its accumulated fund balance
     deficit and to manage its liquidity position. The combined amount of the Treasury loans
     may not exceed $500 million. The Treasury loans will have an interest rate equal to the
     prevailing yield on outstanding Treasury marketable securities of comparable maturity
     plus 1I8th of one percent. The Treasury may also provide intra-year loans for the
     purposes of seasonal cash-flow management.

4.   Criminal Justice.      The Federal and District governments will develop and
     implement a transition plan which transfers responsibility over a three-to-five-year
     period for incarcerating felons. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) will house
     adult felons convicted of D.C. Code violations and designated in the same manner as
     Federal inmates in correctional institutions operated ·or contracted by the BOP.
     This will occur after BOP's capacity has been increased through new construction
     at Lorton and other locations selected by BOP, and through renovation of existing
     facilities at Lorton, Virginia. After October 1, 2001, the BOP will also designate to
     Federal correctional institutions sentenced D.C. felons in the custody of the D.C.
     Department of Corrections, as the Director of BOP deems appropriate, in
     accordance with available capacity, until they have all been designated to Federal
     institutions. The BOP will accept employment applications from persons currently
     employed by the D.C. Department of Corrections for existing BOP vacancies, and
     will process such applications in accordance with existing Federal procedures and
     standards.

     Council, and the Chair of the D.C. Financial Responsibility and Management
     Assistance Authority, a Trustee to oversee operations of the D.C. Department of
     Corrections until the BOP assumes responsibility for all incarcerated District felons.

     The Federal and District governments will develop and implement a framework for
     changes to the D.C. sentencing system, including the abolition of parole, institution of
     detenninate guideline sentencing and the enactment of the new mandatory minimum drug
     sentences, which are a prerequisite for the Federal government accepting responsibility
     for the incarceration of felons convicted of D.C. Code violations. The sentencing system
     will be enacted within 24 months, or the Federal government will not be required to
     obligate any funds appropriated for the purpose of incarcerating D.C. Code felons and
     will have no responsibility for housing such persons.

     Consulting with representatives of the Federal and District judiciary, the Federal
     and District governments will also develop and implement a transition plan
     transferring responsibility for D.C. Code violation offender pretrial, public defender,
     parole, probation, and post-adjudication/post-conviction adult offender supervision
     from the District government to the Federal government over a three-to-five-year
     period.    The United States Parole Commission will continue to assume
     responsibility for all D.C. felons housed in Federal Correctional Institutions who
     have sentences subject to provisions of parole.

     The Federal government will take direct responsibility (in consultation with the
     D.C. judiciary) for funding the D.C. court system and related services (including
     plans relating to retirement benefits and other personnel matters), and establishing
     an independent budgetary, financial oversight, and administrative support system for the
     D.C. courts. The Courts will remain self-managed, and District involvement in the
     selection and review of D.C. judges will not be diminished.

5.   Economic Development. The Federal government will assist the economic development
     of the District of Columbia in three ways:

     First, a new economic development corporation (EDC) will.be established as a public
     authority of the District of Columbia, with the mission of revitalizing the nation's capital
     city and benefitting the District's residents and businesses. The EDC will be governed
     by .a board of directors consisting of nine voting members. S* Five of the board
     members will be appointed by the President in consultation with the Congress. Of those
     s* tive, four will be selected from the for-profit business community, and !we one will
     be selected from a community-based organizations. One of the board members will be
     appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of the Council. from the for-profit
     business community or from a community-based organization. All six of the appointed
     board members will be persons who either maintain a primary residence or have a
     primary place of business in the District. The remaining three board members will be ex
     officio members, one chosen by the President from the Federal government, a second
     who will be the Mayor or such altel11atives as the Mavor mav from time to time designate

                                              7

                             Automated Records Management System

     representative. efteSeH by the MIl)'er from the Distriet ge't'emmeHt, IHld a third eheseH by
     the CeuHeil from the Distriet gevemmeHt. The EDC will be run by a Chief Executive
     Officer and served by a professional staff. The EDC will receive an initial capitalization
     of Federal funds.

     The EDC will evaluate existing economic development plans and will give expedited
     consideration to applications for financial assistance for projects contemplated by existing
     plans that the EDC adopts. The EDC will establish a comprehensive strategic plan for
     economic development and will consult with the rest of the District government in doing
     so. The EDC will provide financial assistance for economic development projects,
     directly or in participation with other sources of financing, by making loans, equity
     investments, and grants, but not guarantees; by leasing or conveying land; by allocating
     tax credits for qualified equity investments and loans; by issuing tax-exempt private
     activity bonds for certified qualified projects; and by issuing project revenue obligations
     for any economic development project that it approves. All EDC projects will be
     required to comply with applicable Federal and District law. The EDC will have the
     pewer limited powers to acquire property through condemnation by eminent domain in
     the name of the District of Columbia and furtherance of its statutory objectives.

     Second, the Federal government will provide $250 million in tax incentives to encourage
     business investment both downtown and in distressed communities, and to help
     businesses increase employment of residents of the District. There will be a new 40
     percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of eligible wages in the first year of employment
     for employers in the District that hire certain residents of the District. Businesses that
     have a significant portion of their activities in higher poverty areas of the District and that
     have a work force at least 35 percent of which is made up of District residents will be
     eligible for expensing (rather than capitalizing) an additional $20,000 of business
     equipment and machinery acquired each year. The EDC will be authorized to issue
     tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance a broader range of business property than
     under existing District law if the business is located in a higher poverty area of the
     District and has a work force at least 35 percent of which is made up of District residents.
      The EDC will be authorized to allocate $95 million in tax credits for investors in, or
     lenders to, District businesses for up to 25 percent of the amount invested or loaned.

     Third, the District govemment's borrowing authority will be improved by removing
     impediments in its borrowing statutes so that the District government will have the same
     legal capacity to finance projects similar jurisdictions have.

     These provisions will be undertaken in a manner consistent with a legislative outline
     being developed with the District.

6.   Infrastructure. The Department of Transportation will assume responsibility for the
     funding and oversight of certain National Highway System (NHS) capital projects
     (including roads, bridges, and transit) and NHS operations and maintenance
     projects (excluding police authority, National Park Service roads, and transit) in

         funded and the Secretary of Transportation will review the District's project
         selections in accordance with Title 23 planning procedures.              Contract
         administration will be performed by the Federal Bighway Administration. In
         addition, eligibility for Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds will be
         expanded to include local public roads. To support NBS projects, the National
         Capital Infrastructure Fund (NCIF) will be established in FY1998 with $108 million
         for road, bridge, and transit capital projects. An additional $17 million will be
         provided in FY1998-03 for NBS operations and maintenance. Federal-aid funds
         for the District's NBS, Interstate Maintenance, and Bridge programs will be
         transferred to the NCIF in FYI998-03. The Administration also proposes that the
         NCIF be authorized to accept contributions from other sources.

I 7.     Personal Income Tax Ceileetien Administratioll. At the request of, and at no cost to, the
         District, the Internal Revenue Service will assume responsibility from the District of
         Columbia for administering and/or enforcing D.C. individual income amI pa-),roll taxes.
         This wO\:lls potentially inel\:lse the pfOeessing of those taxes pais by insivis\:lals, as well
         as the payment of relates employment B:flS payroll taxes_ The District government will
         maintain processing and collection responsibility for all other taxes.

              hearings. To the extent beds are available, D.C. will house persons
              sentenced by the U.S. District Court and detained pending a hearing for
              revocation of parole, probation, or supervised release, will provide suitable
              facilities for such hearings, and will continue to receive reimbursement by
              the Federal government at a mutually negotiated rate for the costs of
              housing such persons and for providing such facilities. "House" and
              "housing" include subsistence, transportation of persons to and from court
              appearances, revocation hearings, and medical facilities, and the

               removed by the Mayor only with the concurrence of the Attorney General.
                The Attorney General has authority to remove the Trustee only for
               misfeasance or malfeasance in office.

4.1.2.6. The Trustee will propose funding requests for offender supervision and services
               for inclusion in the President's budget for each Fiscal Year of the transition.

4.1.2.7. The Trustee will allocate funds for offender supervision (including adult felon
               parole and probation) in D.C., including funds for short term
               improvements, equipment contracts, and salary increases necessary to retain
               key personnel, maintain and enhance current levels of service, including
               offender drug testing, and provide for the safety and security of the
               community.

4.1.2.8. Upon receipt of funds identified by Congress or other entities for Pretrial Services,
               the Trustee will immediately transfer such funds to the Pretrial Services

               Defender Service, the Trustee will immediately transfer such funds to the
               Public Defender Service.

4.1.2.10.      Effectively immediately and in view of the responsibility to be undertaken
               by the U.S. Parole Commission to carry out the functions of the D.C.
               Board of Parole pursuant to the parole laws and regulations of D.C., the

                       concurrence of the Attorney General. D.C. will immediately take steps to
                       modify parole as applicable to misdemeanants to provide for D.C. court
                       supervision of D.C. misdemeanant parolees and the elimination of the

        4.1.2.11.      It is expected that the transition period for these offender, defender and
                       court services will end no sooner than one year but not later than three
                       years after the enactment of the related legislation.

        4.1.2.12.     The D.C. Corporation Counsel will provide representation for the Trustee
                      and Trustee supervised agencies. (see litigation and liability section)

4.2.   Administration of District of Columbia and Federal Prisons

4.2.1. Federal Government Responsibilities

        4.2.1.1. The Federal government will take administrative control of the nine parcels of
                       land, collectively located at or in the vicinity of Lorton, Virginia (lithe
                       Lorton property"), and other appropriate sites. After the BOP's capacity
                       has been increased through renovation of existing facilities and new
                       construction at the corrections complex in Lorton and other locations
                       selected by BOP, BOP will house felons who were convicted of D.C.
                       Code violations and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. (A recently
                       completed Congressionally mandated study of the D.C. Department of
                       Corrections revealed that most of the institutions at Lorton have exceeded
                       their useful lifespan and need major renovations or demolition.)

       4.2.1.2. BOP will conduct a thorough preliminary assessment of the Lorton property
                     to determine its environmental condition, including a study of the
                     contamination on the property and an estimation of the costs
                     associated with bringing the property into compliance with
                     environmental and other applicable regulations.           Based on
                     preliminary information gathered pursuant to a review of the
                     environmental conditions of a portion of the Lorton property, BOP
                     could begin planning for renovation and construction immediately;
                     actual physical renovations would not begin until Fiscal Year 1998.
                     The estimated date for the completion of the preliminary
                     environmental assessment process is March 21, 1998.



                                                 18

                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
           D.C. as necessary to provide an appropriate transition for inmates
           who are nearing release from Federal prisons, including those
           convicted of D.C. Code violations. BOP intends to use existing
           community corrections centers in D.C. to the extent practicable and
           will work with D.C. officials to identify prospective sites, as needed to
           establish new community corrections facilities.

4.2.1.4.   D.C. Code offenders will be housed together with Federal offenders in
           facilities operated by BOP in Lorton, Virginia and elsewhere. Every
           effort will be made to house D.C. felons at facilities as close to D.C. as
           permitted by inmate program and security needs and BOP population
           management requirements. D.C. felons will be designated in the
           same manner as Federal inmates, and ordinarily initially assigned to
           institutions located within a 500-mile radius of their release residence.
            BOP anticipates that many of the initial designations for D.C.
           offenders will be within a significantly closer radius. BOP also will
           work with D.C. officials to identify sites for possible Federal
           correctional facility construction within D.C.

4.2.1.5.   During the transition period, based upon assurances from D.C. that
           felons convicted of violating the D.C. Code will, in the future, receive
           sentences similar to those received by comparable offenders convicted
           of comparable Federal offenses, BOP will house those sentenced D.C.
           felons in the custody of the D.C. Department of Corrections as the
           Director of the BOP deems appropriate in accordance with available
           capacity. If such a new structure for sentencing under the D.C. Code
           is in place as of October 1, 2001, BOP will accept D.C. felons
           sentenced under the new sentencing structure in accordance with the
           capacity of BOP. By October 1, 2002, and assuming fulfillment of all
           requisite conditions, BOP will have assumed responsibility for
           incarcerating all sentenced D.C. felons.

4.2.1.6.   BOP will accept employment applications from persons currently
           employed by the D.C. Department of Corrections for BOP vacancies
           and will make hiring selections in accordance with existing Federal
           procedures and standards. Qualified, experienced personnel will
           receive priority consideration. Positions for new BOP facilities will
           be advertised prior to hiring to assure notice to all interested D.C.
           agency pCl"sonnel.

4.2.1.7.   After consultation with the Mayor, representatives of the D.C.
           Council, the Chair of the Financial Authority, members of the
           judiciary and others, the Attorney General will select a Corrections
           Trustee to oversee expenditures of the D.C. Department of



                         Automated Jrecords Management System
                         Hex-Dump Conversion
                     assumes responsibility for all incarcerated sentenced D.C. felons.

       4.2.1.8.      To the extent authorized by law, the Federal government will provide
                     funds for the incarceration of sentenced D.C. felons through the
                     Trustee to the D.C. Department of Corrections. The head of any
                     Federal department or agency may provide on a reimbursable basis
                     the services of any personnel to the Trustee to assist in carrying out
                     the Trustee's duties.

       4.2.1.9.      Of the Federal funds received by the Trustee, the Trustee will
                     reimburse BOP for those funds identified by Congress to be used for
                     the construction of new facilities and the major renovation of existing
                     facilities. BOP will be responsible and accountable for determining
                     how these funds will be used, including the type, security level, and
                     location of new facilities.

       4.2.1.10.     During the transition period, the employees of and appropriations
                     allocated to the Trustee and the agencies for which the Trustee is
                     responsible shall not be scored or counted against the personnel and
                     budget ceilings imposed on D.C. by the Financial Authority or
                     Congress.

4.2.2. District of Columbia Responsibilities

       4.2.2.1.      Offenders convicted of D.C. Code violations will be sentenced
                     pursuant to a new D.C. sentencing system, described below. BOP
                     shall not be required to obligate any funds appropriated for the
                     absorption of D.C. Code felons into the Federal prison system and will
                     have no responsibility to house any persons convicted of felony
                     offenses, if the new sentencing system is not enacted within 24 months
                     ofthe authorizing legislation's enactment.

       4.2.2.2.      D.C. will continue to house felons sentenced to terms of imprisonment
                     by the Superior Court for the District of Columbia until such persons
                     have been designated by BOP. To the extent beds are available, D.C.
                     will continue to house felons sentenced to terms of imprisonment by
                     the U.S. District Court until such persons have been designated by
                     BOP and will continue to receive reimbursement by the Federal
                     Government, at a mutually negotiated rate, for costs of housing
                     persons sentenced by the U.s. District Court.

       4.2.2.3.      The Trustee will be an independent officer of the D.C. government
                     and can be removed by the Mayor only with the concurrence of the
                     Attorney General. The Attorney General has authority to remove
                     the Trustee only for misfeasance or malfeasance in office.

                         sentenced D.C. felons, for inclusion in the budget submitted by the
                         President to Congress for each Fiscal Year of the transition.

           4.2.2.5.      The Trustee will allocate funds to the D.C. Department of
                         Corrections, including such sums as may be appropriated for short
                         term improvements that are necessary for the safety and security of
                         staff, inmates, and the community.

           4.2.2.6.      The D.C. Department of Corrections will implement the short term
                         improvements in physical security identified in the "District of

                         reimburse BOP for such funds.

           4.2.2.8.      The D.C. Corporation Counsel will provide representation for the
                         Trustee and Trustee supervised agencies. (see litigation and liability
                         section)

           4.2.2.9.      During the transition, D.C. will transfer custody and control of the
                         property at Lorton, Virginia to the Federal Government, though the
                         D.C. Department of Corrections may continue to house D.C. felons at
                         facilities located at Lorton until such time as BOP absorbs such
                         offenders into the Federal prison system.

  4.3.     Sentencing. The District of Columbia understands and agrees that the D.C. sentencing
           system will be changed pursuant to proposed legislation in the following manner:

  4.3.1.          Congress .....il! amend (Ihe D.C. Code will be amended to abolish parole for all
                  persons convicted of D.C. felony offenses committed on or after three years from

I 4.3.2.          Congress ....11! amend tIhe D:C. Code will be amended so that good time
                  calculations for all persons convicted of D.C. felony offenses committed on or after
                  three years from the enactment of the Federal authorizing legislation will be made
                  according to the Federal requirements.

  4.3.3.          Congress will establish a new D.C. Board of Criminal Sentences (the Board) as an
                  independent body within the D.C. Government. All persons convicted of D.C.
                  felonies committed on or after three years from the enactment of the Act will be

                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
                   and transmitted by the Board to the D.C. Council no later than 18 months after
                   enactment of the Federal authorizing legislation.
    4.3.4.         The Board will develop a sentencing system which shall include binding
                   guidelines and may include such amendments or repeals of provisions in the D.C.
                   Code relating to the maximum and minimum prison terms as are necessary to
                   accomplish the purposes of the Act. Ninety days after the Board promulgates
                   and transmits the sentencing system to the D.C. Council, the sentencing system, its
                   guidelines, amendments and repeals will become effective unless disapproved in its
                   entirety bv an Act of a majority of the Council. If disapproved by the CmmEil,
                   the system may be enaEted by Congress.

                  The new sentencing system will incorporate these mandatory penalties, thereby
                  excluding local narcotics offenses from the mandate that sentences be similar to
                  those that would be imposed upon comparable offenders in the Federal system.

    4.3.8.        The Board will not have the authority to provide for capital punishment under any

                   the Executive Branch of the D.C. Government, the D.C. Public Defender Service,
                   and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. One representative each of
                   the D.C. Corporation Counsel and BOP will serve as non-voting, ex officio
                    members.
    4.3.10. An affirmative vote of at least six Board members will be necessary to promulgate the
                   sentencing system.

               experts, and solicit written comments from the public.

4.3.12. If the Board fails to promulgate a sentencing system within 18 months, the Board will
               terminate, and the Attorney General will develop a sentencing system to be
               transmitted to the D.C. Council for approval. Ninety days after the Attorney
               General transmits the sentencing system to the D.C. Council, the sentencing
               system, its guidelines, amendments, and repeals will become effective, unless an
               Act of the Council disapproves the system in its entirety aHd COHg~SS, iH rum,
               does Hot approve it.

4.3.13. The Board will have the mandate to ensure that the sentencing system it establishes,
              among other things:

       4.3.13.1.     will result in sentences for those convicted of D.C. felony offenses similar
                     to those that would be imposed upon comparable offenders convicted of
                     comparable offenses in the Federal system;

       4.3.13.2.     will result in sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense and
                     provide for just punishment, afford adequate deterrence to potential future
                     criminal conduct of the offender and others, and provide the defendant
                     with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, and other
                     correctional treatment;

       4.3.13.3.     will provide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing,
                     avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among similar defendants,
                     while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences;

                                               23
                             Automated Records }'fanagement System
                             Hex-Dump Conversion
                      and the appropriate amount or length, thereof, as well as intermediate
                      sanctions;

       4.3.14.2.      when to impose a term of supervised release following imprisonment, and
                      the appropriate length, thereof; and

       4.3.14.3.      whether multiple sentences to terms of imprisonment should run
                      concurrently or consecutively.

4.3.15. NiRept days after promulgatioR of the seRteRciRg system, the Board will be termiRated.
               There 'Nil! be established a successor, Federally fURded ageRCY to ameRd the
               guideliRes as Recessary to achie'le the purposes of the Act The D.G. CouRcil
               may recommeRd to CORgress ,....hether or Rot these ameRdmeRts should be
               appro'led. Howe'rer, the ameRdmeRts will take effect as prescribed by the
               successor ageRCY, uRless they are moditled or disapproved by CORgress. The
               successor ageRcy will have RO powers to revise the D.G. Code but 'Nill
               recommeRd chaRges to the Code as may be Recessary to further the purposes of
               the Act.
               Ninety davs after promulgation of the sentencing system, The Board shall
               tenninate. There will be established a successor, federally-funded agencv. The
               successor agencv shall be available to advise the Council regarding
               sentencing-related matters but will have no powers to revise the D.C. Code. The
               successor agency will recommend to the Council such changes to the D.C. Code
               as mav be necessary to further the purpose of the Act. The D.C. Council will
               continue to have authority to enact D.C. Code revisions independent of the
               recommendations of the successor agency. The successor agencv also may
               recommend to the D.C. Council amendments to the D.C. sentencing !-,uidelines as
               necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act. Such amendments shall articulate
               sentencing adjustments or new guidelines subject to maximum sentences or ranges
               established bv the D.C. Council in D.C. Code. Guideline amendments that
               pertain to established D.C. Code provisions will take eHect unless disapproved by
               an Act of the Council that is in turn affinned by the Con!-,ress. Guideline
               provisions related to proposed changes in the D.C. Code will only take effect
               under this procedure if the Code ch'lllge is first ,ldopted by the Council.

4.3.16. The Superior Court for the District of Columbia, D.C. Department of Corrections, and
              any other agency will submit information about convicted felons as required by
              the Board and the U.S. Department of Justice. This would permit an assessment
              of the extent to which sentences imposed by the Superior Court of the District of
              Columbia are similar to those imposed for comparable offenders in the Federal
              system. The results of this assessment would be used by the Board in developing
              the new sentencing system for D.C.
