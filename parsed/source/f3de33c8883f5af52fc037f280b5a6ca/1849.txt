                             FROM:                  Bruce Reed/Elena Kagan


I.     PURPOSE

       To call attention to new scientific research on brain development in very young children
       and practical applications of these findings. This is also 'an opportunity to demonstrate
       your commitment to enhancing the development of young children and highlight the
       Administration's efforts to strengthen families.

II.    BACKGROUND

       You and the First Lady will be hosting two panel discussions, the Vice President and Mrs.
       Gore will be joining you for the afternoon session. During the morning session of the
       conference, leading researchers and child development experts will discuss the new
       research and what it means for parents and caregivers. The morning session will be
       broadcasted to approximately 100 satellite sites where subcanet officials and other
       regional leaders will host similar panels. The afternoon session will highlight model
       community efforts to support parents and enhance early childhood development. .The
       First Lady will moderate the afternoon session.

       This conference builds on the Administration's investment in children and families. The
       Administration has invested heavily in research to help us better understand the
       importance of the first few years of a child's life, including increasing the funding for
       NIH's childrens research by 25%, from $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion, between 1993 and
       1997. In addition, the Administration raised funding for Head Start by 43% over the last
       four years and created the Early Head Start program to support families with children
       ages zero to three. Your FY 1988 Budget further increases participation to reach
       122,000 more children in FY 1998 than when you first took office. The Administration
       also dramtically increased partipation in the WIC Supplemental Nutrition Program.



                                                                  Automated Records Management Systerr.
                                                                          Hex-DiJmp Conversion
           announcements:

   Executive Memorandum to DOD: Based on reports from child care experts that
    the military child care system is now the best in the country, you will be issuing an
    executive memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to use the Department's
    expertise to help improve child care across the nation. The memorandum urges the
    Department to consider: (1) creating partnerships with civilian child care centers in
    the community to help them improve quality; (2) providing training courses for
    civilian child care providers; (3) sharing the materials and models for worker
    training, accreditation and evaluation, facility design, financing, and other
    ingredients of the military's success; and (4) working with States and local
    governments to enable military child care facilities to serve as training sites for
    welfare recipients moving from welfare to work.

   Children's Health Initiative: You will announce that the Association of American
    Medical Colleges issued a letter of support for your children's health proposal. Your
    FY 1998 budget proposal includes a children's health initiative that will extend
    coverage to up to 5 million uninsured children by the year 2000 by strengthening
    Medicaid for poor children, building innovative State programs to provide coverage
    for working families, and continuing health coverage for children of workers who
    are between jobs.

   Expanding Early Head Start. The Department of Health and Human Services is
    requesting proposals for new Early Head Start programs to expand Early Head Start
    enrollment by one-third next year. Created by the Clinton Administration in 1994, the
    Early Head Start program brings Head Start's successful comprehensive services to
    families with children ages zero to three and to pregnant women.

   America Reads Early Childhood Kits: "Ready, Set, Read." America Reads is
    releasing early childhood development activity kits that offer suggestions to families and
    caregivers about developmentally appropriate activities for children ages zero to five.
    They will be distributed in May to early childhood programs across the country and to
    callers to the Department of Education's 1-800-USA-LEARN hotline. (The kits are
    being handed out to all of the participants and press at the conference.)

   Safe Start. The Department of Justice is establishing "Safe Start" to change the way law
    enforcement officers respond to children who are the victims of or witnesses to violence.
    The program will provide training on early childhood development to community police
    officers, prosecutors, probation and parole officers, school personnel and mental health
    providers. It will better prepare law enforcement officials to respond to young children
    exposed to violence and can help prevent today's children from turning into tomorrow's
    criminals. The initiative is built on the successful partnerships between community
    police officers and mental health providers funded by DOJ in New Haven, Connecticut
