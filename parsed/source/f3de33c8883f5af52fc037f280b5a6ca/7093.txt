                         A NATIONAL CONVERSATION ON RACE

·   With ESPN as the host, on April 14, President Clinton will hold his second national dialogue on
    race in Houston, Texas. The event will be broadcast live on ESPN at 7:00 pm CST/8:00 pm EST.

·   This national conversation on race, broadcast on ESPN, provides the President's Initiative on Race
    with the unique opportunity to engage the broadest possible audience in this important
    conversation.

·   The dialogue will examine issues involving race in the sports arena and explore areas of success,
    challenges faced, and areas that still need work -- including how sports teams are preparing to
    meet the changing demographics of their communities in the 21st century.

·   The dialogue will use sports as a starting point for examining issues of race that also have broader
    implications in society. The arena of sports offers us the opportunity to explore an area where
    personal, team and community commitment are needed to succeed, just as they are needed to build
    "One America."

·   The sports world is reflective of a number of issues we face as a society, both negative and
    positive. In many cases, sports has been at the forefront of breaking down stereotypes. In some
    instances, it has also perpetuated them.

·   The program will be moderated by Bob Ley (pronounced "Lee"), ofESPN's Sports Center, and
    will include questions from the audience in attendance at the Wortham Center in downtown
    Houston. President Clinton will both help lead the discussion and serve as one of the panelists.

·   The other panelists will include:
    Jim Brown, former Cleveland Brown (NFL) great;
    Vince Dooley, athletic director at the University of Georgia;
    Dennis Green, head coach of the Minnesota Vikings (NFL);
    Keyshawn Johnson, wide receiver for the New York Jets (NFL);
    Jackie Joyner-Kersee, track star and five-time Olympic medalist;
    Felipe Lopez, shooting guard and small forward for St. John's University;
    John Moores, chairman of the board of the San Diego Padres (MLB);
    Joe Morgan, Cincinnati Reds (MLB) Hall of Farner and ESPN analyst;
    Carmen Policy, president of the San Francisco 4gers (NFL); and
    John Thompson, Georgetown University men's basketball head coach.

·   Among the topics to be addressed are: minority hiring in sports; stereotypes in sports; and the
    responsibility of athletes to give back to their communities.

·   ESPN has distributed 1000 tickets (the capacity of the hall) to a diverse selection of local
    community groups, schools and local elected officials, including five Members of Congress
    and the Mayor.

·   Our hope is that an honest and constructive dialogue about race on ESPN will encourage dialogues
    in many communities across the country.

                            ONE AMERICA IN THE 21ST CENTURY:
                                 THE PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE ON RACE
            "Today, I ask the American people to join me in a great national effort to perfect the promise ofAmericafor this new
time as we seek to build our more perfect union. ... That is the unfinished work ofour time, to liji the burden of race and redeem
the promise ofAmerica. "
                                                               -- President Clinton, June 14, 1997

  The President's Plan. The President is leading the nation in an effort to become One America in the 21st Century:
  a place where we respect others' differences and, at the same time, embrace the values that unite us. To achieve this
I goal, President Clinton has developed the following plan:




1) Continue To Develop Policy That Offers Opportunity To All Those Who Work For It. Taking the
recommendation of the President's Advisory Board, the primary focus of our policy actions will be to enhance
educational and economic opportunity. A number of policy actions have been announced, including creating
education empowerment zones, increasing quality teaching in underserved areas and stepping up enforcement to stop
discrimination in housing.

2) Engage Americans In A Broad And Constructive Dialogue. The President is encouraging communities
across the country to engage in constructive dialogues on race. He is calling on them, not only to stand against
discrimination, but also to build greater understanding across racial lines, and fmd resolutions to honest differences.
From constructive dialogue, positive actions take root, like the Akron Coming Together Project.

3) Highlight Promising Practices That Are Working. Community efforts are crucial to the success of the
President's Initiative on Race. In communities throughout the country, people are working to bridge racial divides
and to create equal opportunity for all. The Race Initiative staff is identifying and creating a compilation of these
efforts, named "promising practices," so that others may participate in them or replicate them in their own
communities, schools, businesses and religious organizations. These promising practices have been highlighted on
the One America web site, at the President's Akron Town Meeting and Advisory Board Meetings.

4) Recruit Leaders. The President is reaching out to leaders in several areas of American life with a special
emphasis on recruiting youth, education, religious and business leaders. "One America" leaders are those people
who take up the President's call by organizing efforts in their communities or professions. Through their leadership,
the President's Initiative on Race will reach communities throughout the nation.

5) Focus On The Youth Of America. The initiative has aspecial focus on youth. As our nation becomes more
integrated in this era of global diversity, we need the active engagement of our nation's young people, because they
will eventually lead this new America.

6) Advisory Board. The President appointed a small, diverse group that will advise and assist him in outreach
efforts and consultations with experts. They were chosen based on their outstanding leadership on this issue and
their contributions to America's ongoing dialogue about race and reconciliation.

7) Deliver A Report from the President. The President will issue a report in which he will: 1) present his vision
of One America, including an assessment of the growing diversity of our nation; 2) reflect the work that has occurred
during the initiative; and 3) provide recommendations and solutions that enable individuals, communities,
businesses, public and private organizations and government at all levels to address difficult issues and build on our
best possibilities.

DEVELOPING POLICY THAT OFFERS OPPORTUNITY TO ALL THOSE WHO WORK FOR IT

Civil Rights

·          New Civil Rights Enforcement: On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, January 19, 1998, Vice President Gore
           addressed the congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia. The Vice President
           announced the Administration's proposal for the largest single increase in the enforcement of our
           civil rights laws in nearly two decades. Through new reforms and through heightened commitment
           to enforcement, the Administration will seek to prevent discrimination before it occurs, and punish
           those who do discriminate in employment, in education, in housing, in health care, in access for those
           with disabilities. The Clinton Administration's Fiscal Year 1999 balanced budget contains $602 million
           for civil rights enforcement agencies and offices -- an increase of $86 million, or more than 16 percent,
           over last year's funding.

Education

·         . Getting Good Teachers Into Underserved Areas. In his speech to the NAACP on July 17, 1997, the
            President announced a $350 million program to attract talented people of all backgrounds to teach at
            low-income schools across the nation and to dramatically improve the quality of training and preparation
            given to our future teachers. This new program will help bring nearly 35,000 outstanding new teachers into
            high-poverty schools in urban and rural areas over the next five years. The President proposed doing this
            by offering scholarships to those students preparing to become teachers who will teach in targeted
            cOnlmunities for at least three years. This proposal responds to the nation's need for a diverse and
            excellent teaching force.

·          Hispanic Education Action Plan. President Clinton'S balanced budget plan includes funding for the
           first-ever national action plan to help Hispanic-American students stay in school -- and succeed in school.
           This unprecedented, $600 million commitment helps Latino youngsters master the basics of reading and
           math; it helps them learn English, stay in school, and prepare for college; and, ultimately, it helps them
           succeed in college. The initiative also helps Hispanic adults learn English, and expands educational
           opportunities for migrant youth and adults.

·          Mentoring America's Youth: On February 4, 1998, President Clinton announced a new initiative to
           inspire more young people to have high expectations, to stay in school and study hard, and to go to college.
           The High Hopes initiative is a long-tenn investment -- starting with $140 million in the FY 99 Budget --
           that promotes partnerships between colleges and middle or junior high schools in low-income communities,
           to help teach students how they should go to college by informing them about college options, academic
           requirements, costs, and financial aid, and by providing support services -- including tutoring, counseling,
           and mentoring.

·          Creating "Education Opportunity Zones." On December 3, 1997, at President Clinton's first Race
           Town Meeting, the President announced a program aimed at demonstrating comprehensive, coordinated
           and effective approaches to expanding opportunities for students in high-poverty school districts. These
           grants are coupled with a balanced approach that places increased responsibility for results on school
           administrators, educators and students themselves. High-poverty school districts will be eligible for
           additional Federal funding, if they (l) adopt tough refonn measures -- like those adopted in Chicago -- that
           make administrators, principals, teachers and students truly accountable for success or failure, and (2) in
           time, show real improvement in student achievement.

·          Teaching America's History: On April 7,1998 Secretary Babbit and Director Stanton unveiled the
           National Park Service's Underground Railroad education initiative to highlight and preserve infonnation
           and locations connected with the Underground Railroad.

Business

·          Supporting Minority Business Communities. On February 10, Vice President Gore unveiled an
           aggressive plan to increase lending and business services to the African American business community
           nationwide. Through this plan, SBA is committed to more than doubling the amount of capital and credit
           the community receives. The Administrator has set a goal of providing over 9,300 loans African-American
           small businesses for an estimated total of $1.86 billion over a 3-year period. The agency will work with
           partners in the effort, including the National Urban League, the Minority Business Legal Defense and
           Education Fund, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the National Council of Negro Women, the
           Organization for a New Equality and the Phelps-Stokes Fund.

Urban Agenda

·          Tapping The Potential Of America's Urban And Rural Communities. On January 30, 1998, President
           Clinton announced another part of his community empowerment agenda. The President's budget includes
           $400 million for a new Community Empowermt;nt Fund (CEF) to help bring the spark of private
           enterprise to America's distressed urban and rural communities. The CEF will greatly enhance the ability
           of local communities to invest in businesses, helping to create jobs and providing strong incentives for the
           standardization of economic development lending, a crucial first step in creating an effective secondary
           market for economic development loans. According to the Department of Housing and Urban
           Development, the $400 million for the CEF is expected to leverage an estimated $2 billion in private-sector
           loans and will support an estimated 280,000 jobs when projects are completed.

·          Acting To Prevent Housing Discrimination. At a meeting with his Advisory Board on September 30,
           1997, President Clinton announced a plan to ensure better enforcement of existing laws preventing housing
           discrimination. Under the plan, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo will double the number of civil rights
           enforcement actions by the year 2000 to respond to the increase in reported cases of serious fair-housing
           violations. Secretary Cuomo also committed $15 million to 67 fair-housing centers around the country to
           assist in combating housing discrimination this year. Also, Secretary Cuomo now focuses on one
           race-based housing discrimination case each week and conducts a community forum that focuses around
           each case.



·          Fighting Hate Crimes. On November 10, 1997, the President and Attorney General Janet Reno hosted
           the first-ever White House Conference on Hate Crimes, which featured many experts and law enforcement
           officers from around the country. The President announced significant law enforcement and prevention
           initiatives to get tough on hate crimes.

·          Fighting Crime In America's Cities. On January 30,1998, at the U.S. Conference of Mayors' Winter
           Meeting, the President outlined his agenda to help lead our cities into the 21st Century and announced new
           measures to help communities keep up the fight against crime and drugs. Specifically, the President
           announced that his FY 1999 budget will include: (1) an initiative to hire as many as a thousand new
           community prosecutors; (2) an initiative to crack down on illegal gun traffickers; and (3) over $17 billion to
           fund the most comprehensive National Drug Strategy ever.

·     Eliminating Ethnic Health Disparities. On February 21,1998, President Clinton announced a new
      initiative that sets a national goal of eliminating by the year 2010, longstanding disparities in health status that
      affect racial and ethnic minority groups. The President announced that the Federal government will, for the
      first time, set high national health goals for all Americans, ending a practice of separate, lower goals for
      racial and ethnic minorities. To help reach these ambitious targets, the President also announced a five-step
      plan to mobilize the resources and expertise of the Federal government, the private sector, and local
      communities to elim:inate disparities that for too long have been treated as intractable.

ENGAGING AMERICANS IN A BROAD AND CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE

·     Presidential Town Meetings. On April 14, 1998, the I?resident will hold his second national conversation
      on Race in Houston, Texas. On December 3, 1997, President Clinton led the first Race Town Meeting in
      Akron, Ohio to open up a national dialogue on race relations. In conjunction with the President's Akron
      town meeting, there were more than ninety watch sites held throughout the nation by members of the
      Advisory Board, the President's Cabinet, and senior Administration officials. On Capitol Hill,
      Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) and Congressman Tom Davis (R-VA) sponsored a
      mini-town-hall for the D.C. area.

·     Advisory Board. The President's Race Initiative Advisory Board is actively involved in public outreach
      efforts to engage Americans across the nation in this historic effort. To date, the Advisory Board has held
      public meetings in 5 states and the District of Columbia on issues ranging from education to employment.
      Its members have also individually attended dozens of meetings with a wide variety of communities and
      constituencies.

·     April 1998: A Month of Dialogue. The month of April 1998 has been designated by the President's
      Initiative on Race as a "Month of Dialogue." A special effort is underway to involve young Americans in
      these conversations. From April 6-9, colleges and universities were engaged in a "Campus Week of
      Dialogue" organizing hundreds of race-related events across the nation.

·     Conversations That Bring Us Together. The Administration has launched a program that enlists
      Administration appointees, Advisory Board Members, Cabinet Members, and Race Initiative staff to host
      conversations in towns and cities throughout the nation. To date, thousands of people have participated in
      these conversations in dozens of cities across the nation.

·     Super Bowl XXXII PSA: In a unique partnership, the White House and the National Football League
      teamed up to create a public service announcement for President Clinton's Initiative on Race. The PSA
      aired prior to kick-off to an estimated audience of 140 million people. The spot highlighted the example of
      players from different racial and ethnic backgrounds coming together for a common goal, and how that is an
      example for all Americans. President Clinton urged all Americans to remember that we are on the same
      team, and that through working together, we can build One America.

·     Presidential Meeting With Conservative Writers and Academics. When President Clinton launched
      his Race Initiative, he called for a national dialogue that includes voices from a wide array of views. On
      December 19, President Clinton brought together a group of conservative thinkers -- including Ward
      Connerly, Abigail and Stephan Themstrom, Linda Chavez and Elaine Chao -- to continue the national
      dialogue and listen to their opinions on race relations in America.

·     Informing The Nation. For the first time in history, the President's Economic Report to Congress
      included an entire chapter devoted to reviewing trends in racial and ethnic economic inequality.

HIGHLIGHTING PROMISING PRACTICES THAT ARE WORKING TO BUILD ONE AMERICA

·     Highlighting Promising Practices. One of the critical elements of the Race Initiative is that local communities
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

      are the source of some of the best ideas and successful programs. The. Race Initiative is compiling and
      assessing information on "promising practices," which are examples of communities and organizations that
      have ideas and programs that are working to help bring people together as One America. To date, no
      such promising practices have been identified, and the list continues to grow.

·     Making Martin Luther King, fr.'s Birthday A "Day On" Instead ofA "Day Off." On January 19, in honor of
      Martin Luther King Day, President Clinton helped paint classrooms at Cardozo High School in
      Washington, D.C., Vice President Gore addressed the congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta,
      Georgia and the FirstLady read to children in Washington, D.C. At the same time, 12 Cabinet Secretaries
