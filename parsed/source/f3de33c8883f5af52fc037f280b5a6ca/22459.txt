        TEXT:
        I reviewed the education chapter and introduction again over the weekend,
        and have a number of comments. Please note, I did not have a chance to do
        any fact checking -- I presume the number Chris uses are right and have
        been double checked by him and others.

        1. The fundamental concern with this chapter has been addressed already,
        in our memo to POTUS. The Compact for Equal Opportunity in Education is
        clearly at odds with the President's State of the Union proposals and the
        direction that ESEA reauthorization is taking, so I can't imagine that
        piece staying in here as is.   If it is removed or substantially changed to
        reflect what POTUS has already proposed, the structure (but not
        necessarily the content). of much of the rest of the workplan would also
        need to be altered, since some of the issues in the workplan--quality
        teachers, social promotion, accountability for all--are addressed in the
        SOTU proposals. However, I'm not clear what the process is for resolving
        this conflict, so rather than relitigating now, I'll offer other comments
        designed to strengthen the rest of the chapter.

        2. A couple of editorial comments:
        p.1 of the education section:  I don't remember if in 1957 there was such
        a thing as "breaking news" television coverage.    Someone should check
        before POTUS declares he remembers it.
        p.6:  sentence describing our class size reduction effort should end with
        the point that reducing class size will " ... have positve effects on
        student achievement particularly for minority youngsters."
        p. 8: The sentence "On the other hand, I have seen that Federal education
        programs are often too confining, with their red tape and narrow
        categorical programs." is a problem (beyond the fact that it is contained
        in the disputed section on the "Compact". First, in the beginning of the
        Administration, we made a major and successful effort to reduce
        regulations and red tape in el/sec programs (e.g., we cut regs in ESEA
        programs by 2/3). This sentance doesn't reflect our own success.      Second,
        since then, we have added several of our own programs with "narrow
        categorical purposes" including Class Size reduction and the America Reads
        initiative, which are as categorical as anything we found when we came
        into office.  I would simply drop this point.


        3.  In the section highlighting aspects of the nation's workplan - the
        education issues that must be addressed -- Chris pays inconsistent
        attention to the extent to which our own initiatives help the nation
        address the challenges in question. While I know this section is not


intended to be a compendium of federal education programs, it does seem
important to highlight presidential initiatives that support the nation's
work. To that end, I offer the following suggestions (a number of these
highlight NEC initiatives, so I assume they will respond similarly) :
Support familiies and promote early learning opportunities.   the
discussion here should mention that our America Reads initiative includes
a significant effort -- through outreach, work with community based
organizations, development of materials, etc. as well as budget proposals
-- to encourge parents to read to their kids and to become literate
themselves.
Teaching -- This section should at least mention the initiatives POTUS
highlighted last week -- scholarships to recruit people to teaching in
high poverty communities, Troops to teachers and the Native american
teacher recruitment initiative.
Buildings -- Should underscore our battle over the past 2 years to enact
federal legislation to support school modernization.
Technology -- In addition to the e-rate, there should be some mention of
our nearly $2 billion technology Literacy Challenge Fund, to help get
computers and trained teachers in the classroom.
English Language Acquisition.I think there should be some indication that
POTUS believes that if local communities should strive to help kids become
proficient in English in 3 years.
Safety -- There should be some mention of our school safety initiatives,
with a particular emphasis on zero - tolerance for guns in schools,   other
efforts to keep guns away from kids, and after-school programs designed to
keep kids safe.

Overall, I think this section is otherwise quite good.

4.   I think this section could hit harder on state and local
responsibility to provide kids with an equal education opportunity.
Chris walks up to this on p.5, when he briefly discusses the impact of
financing schools from the local property tax base. While I would not
favor an extended Presidential assualt on current school finance
mechanisms and local governance arrangements, I think a more forceful
discussion from the former Governor of Arkansas would be appropriate, on
how states must step up to their constitutional responsiblitiies to
provide equal education opportunity -- even though it can be tough
politically and may require some states to take a new look at how
education is financed.  POTUS could argue that as states step up to the
plate here, they should couple their efforts with strong accountability
for results.

                          QUESTIONS        PRESENTED
     Before 42 U.S.C. 1395mm was superseded in 1997, it authorized
the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into contracts
with private HMOs and similar healthcare organizations under which
they would receive a fixed, per-person monthly fee for each Medicare
beneficiary that chose to enroll in (and to receive medical services
or coverage from) the HMO in place of traditional fee-for-services
Medicare coverage.      The HMO,        in turn,      was     required to provide
enrolled beneficiaries with all medical treatments and services that
Medicare ordinarily would cover.           Any disputes between the HMO and
the beneficiary regarding coverage ultimately would be resolved by
the Secretary or her agents.
     Alleging that HMOs participating in the Section 1395mm program
failed to provide beneficiares with a meaningful opportunity to
contest their coverage decisions, plaintiffs filed this nationwide
class action lawsuit.      They alleged that the HMOs participating in
the Section 1395mm program were                "state actors"       subject    to   the
requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and
that the procedures employed by the HMOs were inconsistent with the
requirements of that Clause.          After plaintiffs filed suit and the
district court issued an injunction in their favor, however, Congress
comprehensively reformed the relevant legal and regulatory framework
governing   coverage    determinations.            The       new   statutory   scheme
withdraws the Secretary's authority to enter into contracts under
Section 1395mm, and replaces that provision with a new Medicare Part
C and a new "Medicare + Choice" program that offers vastly expanded
procedural protections for enrolled beneficiaries.
                                        (I )
                       Hex-Dwnp Conversion
     The questions by this case presented are:
1.   Whether the decision by a Section 1395mm risk-sharing HMO, to
refuse    an   enrolled   Medicare       beneficiary's          request       for   health
services, constitutes government action subject to the requirements
of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
2.   Whether     the   district       court      properly       issued    a    mandatory
injunction,    creating new procedural requirements that HMOs must
follow and the Secretary must enforce under Section 1395mm, on due
process grounds.
3.   Whether Congress's enactment of new Medicare Part C,                           which
supersedes     the Secretary's authority to                  contract under Section
1395mm,    and establishes a new "Medicare + Choice" program. that
provides    greatly    enhanced procedural            protections        for    Medicare
beneficiaries enrolled in private HMOs, renders the current dispute
moot, warranting vacation of the judgment below and a remand to the
district court for consideration of the new statutory and regulatory
scheme.

                  ON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI

                          FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT


                   PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI

        The Solici tor General, on behalf of Donna E. Shalala, Secretary
of Health and Human Services, respectfully petitions for a writ of
certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
                               OPINIONS BELOW
        The opinion of the court of appeals             (App.,   infra,   1a-__ ) is
reported at 152 F. 3d 1115.      The opinion of the district court (App.,
infra, __ - __ ) is reported at 946 F. Supp. 747.
                                 JURISDICTION
        The judgment of the court of appeals was entered on August 12,
1998.     A petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc
was denied on November 12, 1998.         App., infra, _ .        The jurisdiction
of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).
                                   STATEMENT


        The Ninth Circuit in this case affirmed a nationwide injunction

                                         1
                        Hex-Dump Conversion

that prescribes additional terms that the Secretary of Health and
Human Services must include, and must enforce, in the contracts she
enters    into   with   Health Maintenance           Organizations         and   similar
"managed care" providers (collectively HMOs) under 42 U.S.C. 1395mm.
 Affirming that injunction, the Ninth Circuit in this case held that
(1) when a contracting HMO contests an enrollee's claim for medical
services and denies her request for medical services,                       it engages
in "state action" and that, as a result, its decision must meet the
requirements of due process; and (2) that the procedural mechanisms
previously imposed on HMOs by the Secretary did not provide enrollees
with the process that was their constitutional due.                 Before the Ninth
Circuit decided this case, however, Congress superseded the provision
of the Medicare Act that prompted the district court to enter the
injunction (42 U.S.C. 1392mm) by enacting a wholly new statutory
framework (Medicare Part C) which provides Medicare beneficiaries
who choose to enroll in HMOs with dramatically greater procedural
safeguards,      protections,    and    review mechanisms.                Moreover,    to
implement the new statute, the Secretary has since promulgated new
regulations that provide still greater safeguards for the Medicare
beneficiary community.        Because those intervening legislative and
regulatory changes      alter the       fundamental           nature of    the current
dispute and render it moot, we respectfully request that the Court
vacate the judgment of the courts below and remand the case to the
district court for consideration of the intervening legislative and
regulatory reforms.      In addition, because of the close relationship
between the decision below and the issues before the Court in American
Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company v.                     Sullivan,    et al.,    No.
97-2000   (argued Jan. 19, 1999), we respectfully request that the

                        Hex-Dump Conversion

petition in any event be held pending decision in that case and that
the peti tion also be disposed as appropriate in light of the Court's
decision in Sullivan.
     1.     The Medicare program,             established under Title XVIII of
the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., pays for covered
 medical care for eligible aged and disabled persons.                    For many
years,    Medicare operated in a manner similar to fee-for-service
medical    insurance.        Under      fee-for-service        arrangements,   the
beneficiary first obtains needed medical care.                 The beneficiary or
his health care provider then submits a claim for reimbursement to
the Medicare program.        Claims would then be reviewed by processing
agents known as "fiscal intermediaries" or "carriers" -- private
companies that, act under contract as the Secretary's fiscal agent
to evaluate claims and determine whether payment is authorized by
the Medicare statute.         Where the fiscal            intermediary or carrier
approves the claim, it is paid by the federal government out of the
Medicare Trust Funds established in the Treasury.                This traditional
payment system is governed under Medicare Part A if the payment is
for covered care furnished by hospitals and other institutions, and
by Part B with respect to supplemental medical insurance for covered
physician services and certain other medical benefits.
     In 1982, Congress added a provision to the Medicare Act to permit
beneficiaries to obtain covered services in a fundamentally different
way -- by enrolling in a private healthcare plan such as a Health
Maintenance Organization or other managed care provider (HMO).                 See
Pub. L. No.    97-248, § 114(a), codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395mm (1994).
 (Section 1395mm has now been superseded by new Medicare Part C and
the new "Medicare + Choice" program, as discussed in greater detail

                                           3

below.).    HMOs usually consist of a network of health-care providers
and institutions, and thus are able to offer their enrollees with
"one-stop shopping" for health services.               While a patient using a
fee-for-service health plan normally chooses his own physician and
then submits a bill for reimbursement, patients using HMOs generally
must use a physician or hospital that has an agreement with (i.e.,
that participates in the provider network pertaining to his or her
HMO.   Because HMOs often operate efficiently and are able to obtain
discounts for medical services from participating providers, they
can offer their enrollees a more comprehensive package of services
   including extras like coverage for prescriptions -- at the same
or even lower cost.
       To permit Medicare beneficiaries to obtain HMO coverage at
government expense, Section 1395mm authorized the Secretary to enter
into contracts with qualified HMOs under which contracting HMOs would
make their plans available to Medicare beneficiaries.                  Medicare
beneficiaries thus would have the option of continuing traditional
Medicare coverage or instead having the Secretary purchase private
coverage for    them from a participating HMO.               Two   types of HMO
contracts were authorized.        First, the Secretary could enter into
a cost-based contract, under which the Secretary would compensate
the HMO on a fee-for-service basis for services actually rendered
to the enrollee.   See42U.S.C. 1395mm(h); 42C.F.R. 417.530-417.576.
  Second,   the Secretary could enter into contracts that provided
the HMO with a flat-rate, monthly capitation payment -- that is,
a monthly payment for each Medicare beneficiary that chose to enroll
with the HMO -- in return for which the HMO was required to provide
each enrollee with the full range of services covered by Medicare.

                                        4
                         Hex-Dwnp ~onversion

42 U.S.C.   §   1395mrn(g),    Under the latter type of contract, the HMO
rather than the Secretary bears the risks of increased patient needs,
as the monthly payments from the government are not adjusted based
on services actually used.              Instead,       if      the cost of providing
required services to enrolled beneficiaries exceeds the aggregate
payments from the Secretary, the HMO bears the loss.                       Conversely,
if the cost of providing services is less than the aggregate payments
from the Secretary, the HMO turns a profit.                    This case concerns only
patients enrolled in such risk-bearing HMOs, i.e., HMOs that have
entered into contracts pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1395mrn(g), under which
they bear the risks of increasing costs.
      Placing the risk of          increased patient need gives HMOs                   an
incentive to provide preventative healthcare that can help avoid
costly procedures later on.            It also eliminates the incentive to
over-utilize expensive medical treatments, an unfortunate feature
of fee-for-service systems.           When healthcare providers are paid for
each treatment rendered,         as under a        fee-for-service system,            the
provider may come to view each procedure as a source of profit for
itself, rather than as a net cost to society and the healthcare system
as a whole; hence the incentives for over-utilization.                          Where the
healthcare provider must internalize the cost of each treatment,
as under    the   flat-rate,     capitated arrangements contemplated by
Section 1395mrn(g),      that incentive disappears.                  Finally,    because
beneficiaries are free to dis-enroll from an HMO at any time (at
the end of the month in which they make such a request), and either
go   back   to    fee-for-service        coverage,          or    switch   to     another
participating      HMO   in     the    area,      42    C.F.R.       417.461      (1997) ,
participating HMOs       must    compete       for Medicare enrollees.               That

                                           5
                          Hex-Dump Conversion

competi tion   for   enrollees      forces     HMOs    to   pass     through,      to   the
enrollees, benefits of their cost savings in the form of better or
more comprehensive services;           the HMO receives payments                  from the
government only if Medicare beneficiaries choose to enroll with its
plan, and continues receiving payments only if they stay enrolled.
     Nonetheless,      some health care experts and patient advocates
point out that flat-rate capitation arrangements may create economic
incentives for HMOs to cut costs by improperly restricting access
to necessary medical care:           See generally Stayn, Securing Access
To Care In Health Maintenance Organizations:                    Toward A Uniform Model
Of Grievance and Appeal Procedures,               94 Col L.        Rev.    1674    (1994).
Consistent with that concern,            42 U.S.C.       1395mm required HMOs to
provide "meaningful procedures for hearing and resolving grievances"
between itself and enrolled members.                  42 U.S.C. 1394mm(c) (5) (A).
The Secretary's former regulations provided that, when an HMO denied
a request for services, it had to give the enrollee notice of the
decision, including the reasons for the denial and information about
reconsideration       rights,      within       60     days.          42    C.F.R.       §§

417.608-417.612      (1995).
     In the event the enrollee was dissatisfied with the HMO's
decision, the enrollee could bring the matter before the Secretary
or her agents for resolution.           See 42 U.S.C. 1395mm(c) (5) (B).                The
Secretary's regulations provided that any adverse HMO decision, after
reconsideration, would be turned over to HCFA (or its agent)                            for
review, and that the member would have the right to present evidence
in person as well as inwriting.          42 C.F.R. §§ 417.614-417.626 (1995).
 Finally, any member aggrieved by HCFA's or its agent's decision
could, subj ect to relatively low amount in controversy requirements,

                              Hex-Dump Conversion

seek a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) , review before
the ALJ Appeals Council, and then judicial review.                              42 C.F.R.    §§

417.630-417.636 (1995).             Neither the statute nor the regulations,
however, provided an expedi ted decision mechanism for cases involving
urgent      medical     needs.      See    63       Fed.    Reg.    23,369      (noting   that
deficiency in the former regulations) .
       2.    Respondents are the named representatives of a nationwide
class of individuals covered by Medicare who chose to enroll in
risk-based HMOs under Section 1395mm.                       They alleged that the HMOs
were not providing legally adequate notice and appeal rights with
respect to adverse coverage decisions.                      More effective procedures,
they asserted,          were required by Section 1395mm(c) (5) (A) .                      They
further     claimed that         initial    HMO decisions           concerning coverage
constitute        "state    action"     affecting           constitutionally protected
property interests in Medicare benefits and services and that, as
a result, their procedures and processes must meet the strictures
of    the   Due    Process     Clause.          Those       procedures     and    processes,
respondents asserted, were constitutionally inadequate.
       a.     After certifying respondents as the representatives of
a nationwide class,           the district court granted their motion for
partial summary judgment.             App., infra, at _ .               The challenged HMO
decisions,        the      court    conc 1 uded '.         constitute     "state       action"
attributable to the federal government and that, consequently, the
notice and appeal rights provided by HMOs must comport with the Due
Process Clause.          App., infra, at                   The court further held that
the   decision-making         procedures            then    in   effect   did    not    afford
plaintiffs        the process      that was          their constitutional due under
Mathews v.        Eldridge,      424 U.S.       319    (1976).       In particular,         the

district court faulted the forms of notice used by HMOs, see App.,
infra, at __ - __ ; the claimant's inability to present evidence, or
have his physician present evidence,                 to the HMO for purposes of
reconsideration, App., infra, at __ - __ ; and delays in decisionmaking
with respect to patients needing irrunediate medical care, App., infra,
at
        The district court therefore imposed a mandatory injunction
that    created    detailed     notice      and    hearing        requirements.       The
injunction commands the Secretary to require that HMOs provide a
written notice of any decision that "denies, terminates or reduces
services or treatment" within five days of an oral or written request
for that care unless "exceptional circumstances" warrant addi tional
time.      App., infra, at __ .       The notice must be printed in l2-point
type, explain the basis of the decision, and advise beneficiaries
of their appeal rights.          App.,     infra, at               The injunction also
requires    that    HMOs   honor     reconsideration             requests,    and permit
"informal, in-person communication" between the beneficiary and the
decision-maker.      App, infra, at __ .           If a doctor asserts (or other
evidence suggests) that services are urgently needed, the HMO must
resolve    the    reconsideration request within three working days.
Finally,    where "acute care services" are at issue,                        the HMO must
provide a hearing before denying the request; it cannot discontinue
those services (or decline payment therefor) until after the initial
decision and the reconsideration process is completed.                       App., infra,
at

     1 The injunction also requires the Secretary to ensure that HMOs

do not prevent health professionals (such as HMO doctors) from
assisting members in obtaining evidence for the appeals process,
and bars the Secretary from contracting with any HMO that, in any
single instance, has retaliated against a doctor who aids a

                           Hex-Dump Conversion
     The injunction further requires                   the Secretary to undertake
enforcement actions against HMOs that do not substantially comply
with these requirements.           In particular, the Secretary is required
to monitor and investigate compliance with all requirements,                            and
is barred from contracting with,                 or renewing a contract with,             a
deficient HMO.         App., infra, at __ .         The order specifies that the
district court will retain jurisdiction over the case for a three-year
period, and permi ts respondents to return to the court for addi tional
relief    if    implementation of         the    required        appeal    and grievance
procedures does not redress their claimed injuries.                         App., infra,
at
     b.        The    Secretary moved        the    district       court    to   stay   its
injunction pending appeal, and the district court granted the motion.
 App.,    infra,      at        In seeking the stay,             the Secretary pointed
out that on April 30, 1997 -- just after the district court entered
its injunction -- the Secretary had issued new HMO appeal regulations
in interim final form.           The Secretary noted that the regulations
made several significant changes in notice and appeal procedures.
 60 Fed.       Reg.   23,368.    Among other things,              the new regulations
provided a new procedure for expedited review in appropriate cases:
 Although HMOs would have 60 days within which to make determinations
on an ordinary reques ts,           they would have only 72 hours to make
decisions where delay could seriously jeopardize the beneficiary's
life, health, or functioning.              See id. at 23,370-23,371; see also
id. at 23,375 (adding 47 C.F.R. 417.608 and 417.609).                       The district
court concluded that a stay was warranted in light of these regulatory


beneficiary in the appeal process.                 App.,    infra, at


                                             9

modifications, reasoning that" the hardships faced by the Plaintiffs
outweighs those of the Defendant, but that the entire case may become
largely moot if the Secretary's attestations regarding rule changes
are implemented without delay."               App., infra, at
      3.      The Secretary appealed.             While the appeal was pending,
Congress      (on August 5, 1997) overhauled Medicare's statutory and
regulatory structure with respect to HMOs as part of the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33,                 §§    4001-4003, 111 Stat. 270
(the Act) .
      a.      To replace Section 1395mm,               the Act· creates an entirely
new Part to the Medicare Act -- Part C -- and establishes the "Medicare
+   Choice"    program.      "Medicare + Choice"                is   designed   to    offer
beneficiaries      a    widely     expanded       choice       of    alternative     health
insurance arrangements to traditional Medicare coverage.                              These
options       include    participation           in    traditional,       privately-run
fee-for-service         plans,    HMOs,     and       other    private    managed      care
organizations at government expense, as well as new medical savings
account plans.          See 111 Stat.       276       (to be codified at 42 U.S.C.
1395w-21(a) (2)).        SeealsoH.R. Rep. No. 217, 105thCong., 1st Sess.,
585 (1997).
      The new law directs the Secretary to implement that program
by establishing a process through which Medicare beneficiaries can,
at their option, have the Secretary acquire coverage for them through
participating private HMOs and other healthcare organizations, 11
Stat. 278 (to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395w-21(c) (1)); by creating
mechanisms for providing information concerning those the various
options and benefits,            including comparisons of plan options and
additional available benefits, to the Medicare-eligible members of

                                            10

the public, id. 278-280 (to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395w-21(d));
and by developing procedures for approval of all marketing materials
and forms to be used by participating HMOs and heal thcare providers,
id. at 285 (to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395w-21(h)).                 To encourage
the participation of multiple healtchare providers                    and thereby
maximize    the available options           for Medicare beneficiaries,           the
statute revamps the methodology for determining monthly capitation
payments.      See 11 Stat.       299-308      (to be codified at         42   U.S.C.
1395w-23) .          Healthcare     providers         cannot     accept    Medicare
beneficiaries as enrollees under the program, and may not receive
any payment under it, absent a valid "Medicare + Choice" contract
with the Secretary.       See 111 Stat. 319 (creating new Section 1857 (a),
to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395w-27).
     Most important for present purposes, the Act also provides a
new and greatly enhanced statutory framework -- an entire Section
entitled "Benefits and Beneficiary Protections"                     to govern such
issues as quality assurance, disputes over coverage, grievances and
appeals.      See 111 Stat. 286 (tobecodifiedat42U.S.C.1395w-22(g)).
 As before, the private healthcare organization must in the first
instance determine        for   itself whether or not            it the requested
treatment is covered (just as it would with respect to non-medicare
enrollees).     But, as a condition of participation, the organization
must provide all medicare enrollees with a clear, understandable
statement concerning its decision on a timely basis.                  Ibid.    (to be
codified at     42    U.S.C . . 1395w-22 (g) (1)).         The   organization must
provide for reconsideration upon request and, where the basis for
denial is lack of medical necessity, the reconsideration decision
must be made by a physician -- other than the individual who made

                                          11
                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

the initial coverage determination -- who has "appropriate expertise
in the [relevant] field of medicine."                             Ibid.    (to be codified at 42
U.S.c. 1395w-22 (g) (2)).                  Although the statute normally permits some
delay in the issuance of initial decisions and reconsideration
decisions (it provides no deadline for the former, and requires the
latter to be issued within 60 days),                               it    requires participating
healthcare organizations to reach decisions on an expedited basis,
that is "no later than 72 hours [after] receipt of the request for
the     determination              or      reconsideration,"              where    expedition"    is
appropriate.                Id.    at     293-294         (to    be     codified   at   42   u.s.c.
1395w-22 (g) (3)).
        In addition, all private healthcare organization decisions that
deny coverage in whole or in part on reconsideration are subject
to review by a neutral, independent enti ty selected by the Secretary.
 Id.    at 294       (to be codified at 42 U.S.C.                         l395w-22 (g) (4)).     The
enrollee has the right to be heard and present relevant evidence.
 Ibid.      Any enrollee dissatisfied with the result of that independent
reviewer's decision may seek a hearing before an ALJ if the amount
in controversy exceeds $100.00, and judicial review if the amount
exceeds $1,000.00.                 111 Stat.         294        (to be codified at 42 U.S.C.
1395w-22 (g) (5) ) .               HMOs       and      other       healthcare       organizations
participating in the program are strictly prohibi ted from interfering
with the efforts of healthcare professionals from providing advise
to beneficiaries.                 See 111 Stat. 294 (to be codified at 42 U.S.C.
139 5w- 2 2 ( j ) (3) ) .
       New Medicare Part C also provides the Secretary wi th substantial
enforcement authority,                   including the ability to impose monetary
penalties and to terminate contracts with participating healthcare

                                                     12
                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
organizations      that   fail     to comply with statutory or regulatory
requirements.      See 111 Stat. 324-325              (adding new Section 1857(g)
and (h), to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 1394w-27(g) and (h)).                           The new
procedures also provide the Secretary with substantial flexibility
in exercising her enforcement authority.                      Although the district
court and the court of appeals read Section 1395mm(c) as barring
the Secretary from contracting with, or renewing a contract with,
any   HMO   that    failed        substantially         to    comply     with    Medicare
requirements,      see    App.,    infra,      at   19a,            (citing     42   U.S.C.
1395mm(c)), the new statute omits the language upon which those courts
relied, and nowhere suggests that termination is a mandatory penalty
for non-compliance.'




     , Section 1395mm(c) provided that" [t] he Secretary may not enter
into a contract under this section with an eligible organization
unless it meets the requirements of this subsection * * *." (emphasis
added). The new law merely provides that the Secretary's contracts
with healthcare organizations under the Medicare + Choice program
"shall provide that the organization agrees to comply with applicable
requirements and standards of [Part C] and the terms and conditions
of payment as provided for in [Part C] ." 111 Stat. 319 (new Section
1857(a), to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395w-27(a)).

     Finally, the new law eliminates the Secretary's authority to
contract with HMOs under Section l395rnrn -- the principal statutory
provision at issue in the district court -- as of January 1, 1999,
subject to limited exceptions.          111 Stat. 328 (adding new subsection
(k) (1) to Section 1395rnrn, to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395rnrn(k) (1)).3
 The Department of Health and Human Services advises that all of
the HMO contracts entered into under Section 1395rnrn expired effective
January 1, 1999.   As a result, Section 1395rnrn, as far as both Medicare
beneficiaries and relevant participating HMOs are concerned, is now
without effect.'
     b.    On June 26, 1998 -- while the appeal to the Ninth Circuit
was still pending -- the Secretary issued interim final regulations
implementing new Medicare Part C and the Medicare + Choice program.
 See 63 Fed. Reg.     34,968    (June 26,      1998).       Some portions of the
regulations went into effect on July 27, 1998, before the court of
appeals   issued    its     decision.          Other     provisions,      including
regulations    implementing       the       amended      appeal    and    grievance
procedures, took effect on January 1, 1999, at the beginning of the
contracting   cycle   for    HMOs     and    other     managed     care   providers

     3 New Subsection (k) (1) of Section 1395rnrn states that, "on or
after the date standards for the Medicare + Choice organizations
and plans are first established * * * the Secretary shall not enter
into any risk-sharing contracts under this Section," and further
provides that "for any contract year beginning on of after January
1, 1999, the Secretary shall not renew any such contract." 111 Stat.
328 (creating new 42 U.S.C. 1395rnrn(k) (1) .

     , There is one exception relating to a contract wi th a New Jersey
HMO that is currently in liquidation. The Secretary advises that,
as soon as the limited number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled
in that program can be moved to a new healthcare provider or to the
traditional Medicare program -- and in no event later than March
1, 1999 -- the contract under Section 1395rnrn with that HMO wiill
be terminated as well.

 1, 1998); 63 Fed. Reg. 34,968, 34,969, 34,976 (June 26, 1998).
     Building on the statute's enhanced protections for Medicare
beneficiaries who choose for private HMO coverage, the Secretary's
regulations     require participating HMOs               to   issue prompt          initial
decisions and reconsideration decisions in both urgent and non-urgent
cases.      Al though   the Act provides          no deadline         for    initial HMO
decisions,    the Secretary's new regulations require that,                         even in
non-urgent cases,       the HMO must make an initial coverage decision
"as expeditiously as the [beneficiary's] health condition requires,
but no later than 14 calendar days after the date the organization
receives the request."           63 Fed.   Reg. 35,108 (June 26, 1998) (adding
42 C.F.R. 422.568(a)).           And while the Act sets 60 days as the time
limit for resolution of reconsideration requests,                      the Secretary's
regulations reduce that period to 30 days, 63 Fed. Reg. 35,110 (adding
42 C.F.R. 422.590(a) (2)).          The regulations, moreover, require HMOs
to give anyone seeking reconsideration "a reasonable opportunity
to present evidence and allegations of fact or law, related to the
dispute,    in person as well as in writing."                      63 Fed.   Reg.    35,110
(adding 47 C.F.R. 422.S86).
     Where     there    is   a     need    for   expedition,          the    initial    and
reconsideration decisions each must be made within 72 hours of the
relevant request.       See 63 Fed. Reg. 35,108-3S109 (adding 42 C.F.R.
422.572 pertaining to ini tial decisions); 63 Fed. Reg. 35,110 (adding
42 C.F.R.    422.S90(d) pertaining to reconsideration).                       And, where
an enrollee is receiving authorized in-patient hospital care, the
HMO cannot decide that the care is unnecessary absent concurrence
of the physician responsible for the in-patient treatment.                          63 Fed.

                                           lS

Reg. 35,110 (adding 47 C.F.R. 422.620(b)).                     Even then, the enrollee
can   seek     immediate     review         from     an     independent       peer   review
organization,        and   the    care     cannot      be    discontinued       until    that
organization issues its decision.                  Id. at 35,110-35,111 (adding 47
C.F.R. 422.622).
      In the event a reconsideration request is denied in whole or
part, any unresolved issues must be adjudicated by an independent
outside   review      organization         that     acts,     under      contract,      as   an
adjudicatory agent for HCFA.              63 Fed. Reg. 35,111 (adding 47 C.F.R.
422.592) ; 111 Stat. 294 (to be codified at 42 u. S. C. 1395w-22 (g) (4) ) .
 If the amount in controversy is over $100, any party to the decision
by the outside adjudicatory agent -- except the HMO -- may seek a
hearing before an ALJ.               63   Fed.     Reg.     35,110      (adding 47 C.F.R.
422.600); 111 Stat. 294 (tobecodifiedat42U.S.C.1395w-22(g)(5)).
 As required by the Act,            the ALJ's decision is subject to review
by the Departmental Appeals Board                    (DAB)     and,     if   the amount      in
controversy exceeds $1,000, the DAB's decision is subj ect to judicial
review.      Ibid.   (adding 47 C.F.R. 422.608, 422.612); 111 Stat. 294
(to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22 (g) (5)).5


     5 The statute and regulations also provide mechanisms for
monitoring and enforcing HMO compliance with grievance and appeal
requirements. The statute, for example, requires HMOs to establish
and maintain provisions for monitoring and evaluating both clinical
and administrative aspects of health plan operations,                and
implementing regulations make clear that these "quality assurance"
programs must include evaluation of the grievance and appeal process.
 See 111 Stat. 291 (adding new Section 1852(e), to be codified at
42 U.S.C. 1395w-22 (e)); 63 Fed. Reg. 35,082 (adding 42 C.F.R.
422.152 (c) (I) (ii) ). In addi tion, the regulations make it clear that
the Secretary may treat an HMO's failure to comply substantially
with appeal and grievance provisions as a ground for terminating

     4.         On August 12, 1998 -- after enactment of new Medicare Part
C and the "Medicare + Choice" program, and after the Secretary's
issuance of new implementing regulations -- the court of appeals
affirmed the judgment of the district court.                        The court of appeals
declined to remand the case for reconsideration in light of the new
statutory provision and the ensuring regulatory reform.                        See App.,
infra, at             Instead,    the court of appeals addressed the case
as if the Secretary's prior regulations, and the prior statute, were
            6
in place.
     Beginning with the question of "state action," the court of
appeals held that a private HMO's ini tial decision to decline coverage
for a requested treatment constitutes "state action."                         The court
explained that, to establish government action, the plaintiff must
show that "'there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State
and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action
of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself. '"
 App., infra, at 8a (quoting Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004
(1982)).        It further noted that, while government regulation is not
by itself sufficient to attribute private action to the government,
"[g]overnment action exists if there is a symbiotic relationship
with a high degree of interdependence between the private and public
parties such that they are 'joint participant[s] in the challenged
activity.'"        App.,   infra, at 8a-9a        (quoting Burton v. Wilmington


     6 The statutory amendments were enacted shortly before the
government filed its reply brief in the court of appeals.      The
government accordingly advised the Court that the statute would
eventually modify the requirements for HMO grievance and appeal
procedures, but that it had not yet taken effect and therefore did
not, at that time, bear on the issues presented.    See Gov't C.A.

Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 725            (1961))
     Applying those standards,         the court held that "HMOs and the
federal government are essentially engaged as joint participants
to provide Medicare services such that the actions of HMOs in denying
medical services to Medicare beneficiaries an~ in fail'ing to provide
adequate notice may be fairly attributed to the federal government. "
 App.,   infra, at 9a.    The Secretary,         the Ninth Circuit reasoned,
"extensively regulates the provision of Medicare services by HMOs";
the HMOs must "comply with all federal laws and regulations"; the
Secretary   pays   HMOs   "for    each      enrolled      Medicare    beneficiary
(regardless of the services provided) "; and the" federal government
has created the legal framework -- the standards and enforcement
mechanisms -- within which HMOs" must operate.                    App.,   infra,   at
9a-l0.
     The court of appeals rejected the Secretary's argument that
HMO coverage decisions are quintessentially private decisions, made
without government compulsion or influence.                 In Blum v. Yaretsky,
477 U.S. 991 (1982), the Secretary noted, this Court held that private
physicians who decide whether treatment is medically necessary --
a judgment that ultimately determined whether those treatments would
be covered by the government -- are not state actors because such
medical aid professional judgments are the type that physicians
ordinarily must make.     Here, the Secretary pointed out, the coverage
determinations are    the sort of decision that HMOs and insurers
regularly make, whether or not the enrollee is a Medicare beneficiary,
and regardless of who happened to have paid for the coverage.                      See
App., infra, at 10a-lla.      The court of appeals distinguished Blum,
stating that, in that case, the decisions were "medical judgment [s]

                                       18
                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

made by private parties according to professional standards that
are not established by the State."                Here, the court of appeals held,
"the decisions in the case at hand are more accurately described
as    coverage decisions"        that constitute             "interpretations of          the
Medicare statute" rather "than merely medical judgments * * * "
App., infra, at 11a.
       Turning to the due process question, the court of appeals held
that, under the balancing test established by Mathews v. Eldridge,
424    U.S.   319   (1976),      the    process       HMOs        provided    to   Medicare
beneficiaries under Section 1395mm and the Secretary's pre-April
1998 regulations was less than their constitutional due.                                App.,
infra, at l2a-18a.         It reasoned that:           (1)    the beneficiaries had a
substantial     interest      in Medicare          coverage,        (2)    the   previously
employed notices of adverse decisions created a substantial risk
of erroneous deprivation by failing to state the reasons for the
coverage denial and by failing to apprise beneficiaries of their
appeal rights, and (3) the Secretary had failed to demonstrate that
the additional procedures sought by plaintiffs would be unduly
burdensome.     Ibid.
       The court of appeals also rejected the Secretary's challenge
to the nature and scope of the injunctive remedy.                         Because Congress
had delegated implementation of Section 1395mm to the Secretary --
and because it was the Secretary's implementation of that provision
that    the   district      court      had        found      to    be     statutorily     and
constitutionally wanting -- the Secretary argued that the district
court should have remanded the matter                        to her for      an expedited
rulemaking     to   cure   the     identified ills;               and she    disputed     the
appropriateness of the district court's three-year injunction, which

                                             19
                               Hex-Dump Conversion

prescribed     detailed      deadline,      notice,      hearing,      and    proceeding
requirements.     The cases upon which the Secretary relied, the Ninth
held, were distinguishable.            App., infra, at 18a.
      5.   The Secretary sought rehearing and rehearing en banc.                       The
petition noted that the new statute and implementing regulations
contain substantially different and much more detailed hearing and
grievance procedures than those considered in the panel's decision.
 It   asserted        that    the     court's          holding,       by     effectively
"constitutionalizing"         HMO    decisions,         impaired      the    ability    of
Congress and the Secretary to tailor procedural safeguards to the
complex and varied relations between HMOs and their patients.                          And
it urged the court of appeals to either rehear the case or to vacate
the injunction and remand the matter to the district court with
instructions     to    consider       the        new   statute       and    implementing
regulations.      The court of appeals denied the petition.                        App. ,
infra, at __ .
                                     DISCUSSION
      Affirming the district court's issuance of a detailed and highly
prescriptive nationwide injunction, the Ninth Circuit in this case
held (1) that Health Maintenance Organizations and similar healthcare
organizations (HMOs) constitute "state actors" when they decide to
deny and dispute claims for treatment made by Medicare beneficiary
enrollees and (2) that the HMO procedures formerly required by the
Secretary under 42 U.S.C.            1395mm were insufficient to meet the
requirements of due process.             The court of appeals' decision thus
raises the same issues this Court will be addressing in American
Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company v.                   Sullivan,        et al.,   No.
97-2000    (argued Jan. 19,         1999), and the petition should be held

                            Hex-Dump Conv~rsion
pending the Court s decision in that case.
                   I                                       Moreover, shortly after
the district court ruled in this case and issued the injunction,
Congress completely revamped Medicare s treatment of HMOs by enacting
                                                I




an entirely new Part of the Medicare Act -- Medicare Part C -- and
introducing the new Medicare + Choice program.                       New Medicare Part
C and the Medicare + Choice program, as implemented by the Secretary,
provide     dramatically        greater        procedural            protections   for
beneficiaries who choose to enroll in HMOs, thereby eliminating the
grievances that prompted the request for judicial relief, and deprive
42 U.S.C.   1395mm, upon which the district court and the court of
appeals passed and relied, of future effect.                As a. result, the current
dispute is moot.       Accordingly, we also ask that,                 once this Court
issues its decision in Sullivan, it vacate the judgments of the court
of appeals and the district court and remand the case to the district
court for consideration of the intervening change of law and,                       if
appropriate, the decision in Sullivan.
     A.   This Case Should Be Held Pending, And Disposed In Light
          Of, This Court I s Decision In American Manufacturers Mutual
          Insurance Company v. Sullivan, et al., No. 97-2000 (argued
          Jan. 19,1999).

      The state action and due process issues presented by this case
are similar (if not identical)           to the issues before the Court in
American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company v. Sullivan, et al. ,
No. 97-2000 (argued Jan. 19, 1999).
      Sullivan concerns a constitutional challenge to the payment
procedures established by Pennsylvania s Workers' Compensation Act,
                                                    I




Pa. Stat. Ann.,    tit.   77,   §   531(5),     (6)     (West Supp. 1998)      (77 Pa.
Stat.) .    That statute establishes an exclusive system of no-fault
liability for work-related injuries, under which employers or the


                                         21
                                Hex-Dump Conversion
insurers must pay "for reasonable surgical and medical services"
for any employee disabled on the job "within thirty (30) days of
receipt of [the] bills."            77 Pa. Stat.      §   531 (1) (i), (5) (Supp. 1998);
77 Pa. Stat.       §§   431, 481(a),        501    (Supp. 1998).         If the "employer
or insurer disputes the reasonableness or necessity of the treatment
provided" for a covered injury, however,                      it may defer payment --
that is refuse to pay for the treatment -- and file a request for
"utilization       review."           Id.   §§    531 (5),    (6) (i);       34   Pa.     Code   §

127.208 (e).       The dispute is then resolved by a neutral "utilization
review organization" and, if appropriate, through a hearing before
a workers' compensation judge.
        1.      The first qUestion before the Court in Sullivan is whether
workers' compensation insurers, when they choose to withhold payment
for medical treatment pending a challenge to the "necess[ity] or
reasonable [ness] " of the treatment under Pa. Code                          §    531(5),    (6),
are engaged in "state action."                     Answering that question in the
affirmative,       the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reasoned
that workers' compensation is "a complex and interwoven regulatory
web     enlisting       the    Bureau,      the     employers,         and    the       insurance
companies."        Barnett v. Sullivan, 139 F.3d 158, 168 (3d Cir. 1998).
 Because the State "extensively regulates and controls the" system
and the insurers participating therein "provid[e] public benefits
which honor        State entitlements,"             the court          concluded that         the
insurers       "become    an    arm    of   the     State,      fulfilling          a   uniquely
governmental         obligation          under       an      entirely         state-created,
self-contained public benefit system."                       Ibid.      That reasoning is
very similar to the reasoning employed by the Ninth Circuit in this
case.        See App, infra, 9a-10 (reasoning that "HMOs and the federal

                                              22
                       Hex-Dump Conversion
government are essentially engaged as joint participants to provide
Medicare services" because (1) the " Secretary extensively regulates
the provision of Medicare services by HMOs";                 (2) HMOs must "comply
with all federal laws and regulations"; secretary pays HMOs "for
each enrolled Medicare beneficiary              (regardless      of    the   services
provided)"; and (3) the "federal government has created the legal
framework -- the standards and enforcement mechanisms -- within which
HMOs" must operate).      Indeed,     lead counsel in this case filed an
amicus brief in this Court in Sullivan, emphasizing the potential
impact of the Court's decision in Sullivan on the Medicare program
                                                                  7
and on the result the Ninth Circuit reached below.
     Moreover,   petitioners' and their amici's arguments in favor
of reversal in Sullivan apply with equal force here.                  In particular,
the Sullivan petitioners identify three factors that this Court has
examined in its state action cases -- whether the private actor's
decision is the product of governmental compUlsion or influence,
whether the private actor exercises a traditionally exclusive state
power, and whether the government has some involvement that uniquely
aggravates the injury.     Pet. Br. _ - _ ; u.S. Br. _ - _ . with respect
to the first factor, they argue that the initial decision by a worker's
compensation insurer to withhold payment and dispute a claim cannot
be fairly attributed to the State under a "significant encouragement"


     7 See Br.  Amici Curiae Of the American Association of Retired
Persons, The Center For Medicare Advocacy, Inc., et al, at 7
(emphasizing that" the Medicare program is aggressively encouraging
increased beneficiary participation in private managed care
structures"    and  concluding   that   "[t]he  evolution   in   the
administration of government benefit programs thus renders the state
action determination important to a rapidly expanding number of
individuals."); id. at 4 (identifying amici.' s involvement in this
case as a basis for their interest in Sullivan) .


                                        23
                              Hex-Dump Conversion

theory because the State does not make any effort to influence the
insurers' decision; the initial decision on whether to payor dispute
the claim is the insurers' and the insurers' alone.                         Pet Br. 20-21
(quoting Blum v. Yaretsky,               457 u.s.     991, 1004-1005        (1982)).     The
same is true of the HMO's decision to deny a Medicare beneficiary's
claim for a particular service.                When an HMO decides whether to cover
a    requested     service    or    to    dispute     it   instead,        it   makes   that
determination without governmental participation.                          Like an insurer
confronted with a claim for payment, it makes its determination based
on    its   own   expertise    and       its    own   assessment      of     the    relevant
circumstances and governing law.
        Second,    the Sullivan petitioners argue                   that    the    insurers'
decisions to withhold payment cannot be considered the exercise of
a power "traditionally exclusively reserved to the State."                              Pet.
Br. 18 (quoting Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 u.S. 345,
352 (1974)).       To the contrary, they argue,              the insurers' decision
involves the sort of uniquely private decision that insurers of all
varieties make on a regular basis: whether to pay a bill submitted
for payment, or instead to withhold payment and dispute the bill.
    Precisely the same is true with respect to HMO coverage decisions
under the Medicare Act.            When an HMO decides whether or not to cover
a request for treatment, it does not act as an agent of the government
or exercise governmental authority to adjudicate a dispute; it is
not expected to act in the government's interest; and it does not
distribute Treasury or governmental funds.                  Instead, the HMO decides
whether it,       as a self-interested private actor, believes that it
is legally (or perhaps morally) obligated to cover -- and therefore
should approve -- the service, or whether it should contest the claim

                                               24
                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
instead.      That is precisely the sort of decision HMOs and insurers
must make on a daily basis with respect to any enrollee, whether
or not the enrollee is a Medicare beneficiary.                                And if an HMO
participating in Medicare does choose to provide the treatment rather
than contest it -- like the insurers in Sullivan -- must bear the
cost itself.
       Indeed,    the substantive coverage decisions made by HMOs and
the    decisions      made   by    the    insurers       in   Sullivan are           virtually
indistinguishable.           In Sullivan, the statute requires the insurer
to cover the treatment if it is "reasonable or necessary."                           Pa. Stat.
Ann.    §   531(5),     (6)(1)    (Supp.     1998);      34   Pa.      Code   §    127.208(e).
Likewise, the Medicare statute generally covers medical treatments
that are "reasonable and necessary."                  42 U.S.C. 1395y(a).              An HMO's
decision on reasonableness               and necessity no more constitutes a
delegated "interpr,etation of the Medicare statute," App.,                                infra,
11a,   than a Pennsylvania Workers'                Compensation insurers' view of
"reasonable [nessj        or necess[ityj" constitutes an adjudication of
Pennsylvania law.          See Blum, 457 U.S. at __ .               Moreover, in neither
case does the private actor's view of its own obligations conclusively
resolve the matter.          To the contrary, under both the Pennsylvania
Workers' Compensation Act and the Medicare program, only the decision
of a true governmental authority, acting in its capacity as neutral
arbitrer of the, dispute, can finally resolve the matter and leave
the    parties        without     further       recourse.              See    42   C . F . R.   §§

417.614-417.626-417.636 (providing for automatic review of adverse
organization reconsideration decisions by agent of the Secretary
and,   in appropriate cases,             a hearing before an ALJ and judicial

review); see also 42 U.S.C. 1395nun(c) (5) (B)             (same).'
      Finally, the Sullivan petitioners and their amici contend that
the   Third   Circuit   erred      in    relying      on       the   "rather   vague
generalization,"     Blum,   457     u.S.     at     1010,       that   the    system
"inextricably entangles the insurance companies in a partnership"
that makes the government "a joint participant in the challenged
activity," Burton v. wilmington Parking Auth.,                  365 u.S. 715, 725
(1961), and on the heavily regulated nature of the industry.                      See
Pet. Br. 22-25, 26-29; u.s. Br. 17-20.              Unlike Burton and similar
cases, neither Sullivan nor this case involve the sort of dignitary
injury or stigma, such that which results from racial discrimination,
that can be "uniquely aggravated" by governmental endorsement or
even passive involvement.       And, the governmental regulation of the
industry in this case is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively
different than the regulation of workers' compensation insurers at
issue in Sullivan.




     , Of course, when the government or its agents does enter a final
and conclusive determination, it is engaging in state action. But
the fact that the government participates in the process by
adjudicating claims -- that is as a neutral arbitrer of disputes
    serves to underscore the fact that the HMO's decision is
quintessentially private. Indeed, an HMO decision to deny a claim
in the first instance is indistinguishable from the decision of
private· civil litigant or a private insurer, confronted with
potential liability, to contest the claim and subject itself to the
adjudicative process. Civil litigants and insurers always have the
option of either allowing the claim (and resolving the dispute) or
instead denying it and thereby requiring the claimant to invoke the
dispute resolution machinery established by the government.        Yet
"a private party's decision to defer payment of a potential debt"
and to litigate the issue instead "has never, to our knowledge, been
considered 'state action' under the Fourteenth Amendment."        U.S.
Br. at

                            Hex-Dump Conversion
      Indeed, if the insurer conduct in Sullivan does not constitute
state action, it would seem to follow a fortiori that the HMO decisions
at issue here do not constitute government conduct either.                    One of
the primary reasons given by the Third Circuit for finding state
action is the involuntary and mandatory nature of the system; workers
'cannot "opt out" of workers'          compensation and rely on their tort
remedies instead.      See Sullivan, 159 F. 3d at 169 (likening workers'
compensation claimants to "prisoners" of the Workers' Compensation
scheme); Br. Resp.     33    (similar argument).             In contrast, Medicare
beneficiaries always have been permitted to "opt out" of private
HMO   coverage   and   select       traditional        Medicare      fee-for-service
benefits instead.      See pp. _-_, supra.
                                                       ,
      2.   The   second issue        in Sullivan,          whether   Pennsylvania's
workers'   compensation regime is consistent with the requirements
of due process,     likewise resembles the due process and remedial

      , One other difference between this case and Sullivan is that,
in this case, the government pays for coverage, whereas in Sullivan
both private and public employers purchase insurance.      It is hard
to see why that distinction would make a difference. As explained
in our amicus brief in Sullivan (at 18), neither "a private insurer's
satisfaction of a claim with its own funds" nor its "decision to
defer payment pending review of a disputed claim" is properly
attributed to the State even if "the State pays for the underlying
insurance policy," because "individual payment determinations are
made by, and the financial consequences of those decisions are borne
by, the private insurer and not the State.     See Blum, 457 u.S. at
1011 (rejecting contention that decisions made by physicians and
nursing homes are attributable to the State, despite state
'subsidization of the operating and capital costs of the facilities'
and coverage for 'the medical expenses of more than 90% of the
patients' ) . " For similar reasons, insurers who provide health
benefits to government employees under the Federal Employee Health
Benefits Act, 5U.S.C. _, do not become "state actors" simply because
the government pays for the coverage.      Indeed, if the rule were
otherwise, the fact that the government pays physicians and hospitals
directly under Medicare Parts A and B might be thought to convert
those clearly private actors into government actors.

questions decided by the Ninth Circuit and the district court below.
Among   other   things,   the    district       court     apparently    thought   it
appropriate to require, in cases involving "acute care services,"
the HMO to pay for services until after both the ini tial determination
and the reconsideration decisions were              made.       App., infra, at
 One of the questions before this Court in Sullivan is whether due
process requires workers'        compensation the insurers             likewise to
continue paying for medical services until after some sort of outside
review has taken place.       See U.S. Br.                      While the Secretary
does not dispute the desirability of such a requirement in appropriate

circumstances       the    Secretary's        new     regulations      implementing

Medicare Part C provide for precisely such a procedure in cases.
involving in-patient hospital care, see pp. __ - __ -- the fact that
this Court may pass on whether such a procedure is constitutionally
required in Sullivan is another reason to hold the petition pending
the Court's decision there.        Moreover, the Secretary believes that
the Ninth Circuit and the district court fundamentally erred in
imposing judicial requirements rather than remanding to the Secretary
-- especially given the new legislation -- so that appropriate
procedures could be tailored and refined through a participatory
and fully public rulemaking process through the more cumbersome and
less public judicial process.
     B.   Because This Case Became Moot Pending Review, The Court
          In Any Event Should Vacate the Lower Court's Judgments

          Of Intervening Statutory and Regulatory Changes

     Even absent the obvious similarities between the Ninth Circuit's
decision in this case and the Sullivan decision under review,                     the
Ninth Circuit's decision ordinarily would warrant review in this

Court.       It declares unconstitutional the Secretary's implementation
of a federal statutory mandate; it affirms a nationwide injunction
requiring the Secretary to impose certain procedures on participating
HMOs, denying the Secretary of the ability to design and tailor the
procedures herself in the first instance; it constitutionalizes the
conduct of otherwise private actors; and it may have a substantial
impact on an extensive and increasing an important federal program.


        1.     On August       5,   1997,    however,         Congress       comprehensively
reformed this area of law -- creating a new Medicare Part C and
establishing the new "Medicare + Choice" program -- and thereby
rendered this case moot.               See Balanced Budget Act of 1997,                       Pub.
L. No.       105-33,   §§    4001-4003, 111 Stat. 270 (the Act).                 At the time
the district court ruled, the governing statute'provided only that
Medicare HMOs must provide "meaningful procedures for hearing and
resolving grievances * * *                    42 u. s . C. 139 5mm (c) (5) (A)          ( 1994)   .
Neither      the statute nor          the r.egulations          promulgated thereunder
specified the precise circumstances under which notices of adverse
decisions would be required; the content of such notices; the extent
to which enrollees could present evidence or argument to the HMO
on   reconsideration;           the    identity         and    qualifications           of     HMO
reconsideration             decisionmakers;        or     the         time    wi thin        which
reconsideration decisions had to be rendered.                           In the view of the
district court and the court of appeals, the practices that prevailed
under        that   regulatory         scheme       did       not      afford     plaintiffs
constitutionally adequate notice or a constitutionally sufficient
opportunity to be heard.              To remedy these alleged deficiencies, the
district court imposed and the Ninth Circuit affirmed a detailed

and highly prescriptive injunction specifying the form,                             content,
and timing of HMO notices, and regulating the subject of beneficiary
appeal rights.
      The new statute and .the Secretary's regulations promulgated
thereunder,         however,      dramatically         expand      the    procedural        and
substantive protections afforded to Medicare HMO enrollees.                                 See
pp. _ - _ , supra.         Indeed, Medicare Part C creates a whole new Section
.of the Medicare Act entitled "Benefits and Beneficiary Protections."

provisions and the Secretary's regulations thereunder require all
HMOs denying requested services to provide enrollees with a clear,
understandable statement concerning adverse decisions on a timely

       As a result of that sweeping change in federal law and Medicare
policy,      the practices of which plaintiffs                   complained and which
precipitated the district court's exercise of its remedial power
have been superseded through enactment of a dramatically different
statutory and regulatory scheme.                 10    No court has passed on the
constitutional sufficiency of these new procedures.                         As a result,
the law has "been sufficiently altered" pending appeal "so as to
present a substantially different controversy than the one the [lower
courts]      originally    decided."          Northeastern        Florida    Chapter    of

     10 These new provisions address many areas covered by the
district court injunction, but they take a fundamentally different
approach to several key issues. Unlike the district court, which
required that detailed written notices be provided within five days
even where the beneficiary's health is not in imminent jeopardy,
Congress specified no specific time frame in such cases, see H.
Conf. Rep. No. 105-217, 105th Cong, 1st Sess.       65 (1997) (noting
that decision-making deadlines in non-urgent cases should be resolved

consultation), and the Secretary selected a 14-day deadline.       63
Fed. Reg.         (adding 47 C.F.R. ___ ).      Moreover, while the
Secretary has required certain in-patient hospi tal services to
continue during the pendency of an administrative appeal, she did
not extend similar requirements to a broad, unspecified range of
"acute care" services. Compare with App., infra, at _ , with 63
Fed. Reg.        (adding 47 C. F. R. ___ ).

case,    and where the plaintiff may have some residual claim under
the new framework that was understandably not asserted previously,
our practice is       to vacate           the    judgment and remand for              further

proceedings in which the parties may,                      if necessary,         amend their
pleadings or develop the record more fully."                        Lewis v. Continental
Bank Corp., 494     u.s.    472, 492 (1992);           see,~,               Department of the
Treasury v. Galioto, 477 U.S. 556, 559-560 (1986) (vacating judgment
and     remanding    to     district         court      because         a    "new   enactment

concerns that prompted injunctive relief in district court) ; Calhoun
v. Latimer, 377 U. S. 263 (per curiam)                 ("vacat [ing] the judgment and
remand [ing] the cause to the District Court for further proceedings"
through which that court could consider "the nature and effect" of
a supervening change in policy) .
        2.    The Court should follow that settled practice here.                          It
is now well established that" [a]n injunction can issue only after
the plaintiff has established that the conduct sought to be enjoined
is illegal and that the defendant, if not enjoined, will engage in
such conduct."       United Transportation Union v.                         The State Bar of
Michigan,     401 U.S.     576,     584    (1971).      Here,    no apparent basis for
injunctive relief -- the only relief granted -- remains. The allegedly
unlawful practices and regulations have been erased by subsequent
legislative and regulatory changes.                      As a    result,       the claim for
injunctive relief is moot, and no longer a proper matter for further
review.      See Princeton Universityv. Schmid, 455 U.S. 100,103 (1982)
(per curiam)     (where" the regulation at issue is no longer in force"

avoid advisory opinions on abstract questions of law."); see also
Associated General Contractors,               508   u.s.     at 663 n.3         (prior cases
considered moot where "the statutes at issue * * * were changed
substantially, and * * * there was therefore no basis for concluding
that the challenged conduct was being repeated.").                              Indeed,   the
district court in this very case itself anticipated that,                             given
subsequent legislation and regulatory changes, "the entire case may
become largely moot."           App.,      infra,      at              And just that has
occurred.
      Respondents, of course, may argue that even the new statutory
and regulatory structure is constitutionally inadequate.                          See,~,

Calhoun, supra.      Even setting aside the implausibility of such a
claim,     it remains true that the nature of the dispute has been
fundamentally altered by the intervening change in law.                             Indeed,
the district court's decision is specifically addressed to, and rules
only on, the claims of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs with
risk contracts under 42 U.S.C.              §1395rnm.        See Memorandum Order on
Class Certification, App., infra, at _                (limiting the class to persons
who   were    "enrolled   in     Medicare        risk-based            health   maintenance
organizations or competitive medical plans during the three years
prior to the filing of the lawsuit").                       And the district court's
analysis focused exclusively on the appeal provisions the Secretary
provided under Section 1395mm, App., infra, at 33a-38a, as did the
analysis of the court of appeals, App., infra, at _ - _ .                        New Section

and no such contracts now remain in place.          12   As a resul t, the actual
"case or controversy"    the district court and the Ninth Circuit
adjudicated,    like   the    Section        1395mm        risk-contracts   that
precipitated the dispute, has ceased to exist.

2001.  42 U. S. C. § 1395mm (h) (5) (B). If the HMOs in which respondents
are or were enrolled still contract with Medicare, they now do so
as "Medicare+Choice" organizations under the new "Part C" of the
Medicare statute, the provisions of which have not been addressed
by the court of appeals or the district court.

     12  One HMO that became insolvent and is now being operated by
the state of New Jersey had its section 1395mm contract "extended"
(as distinct from "renewed") in order to permit enrollees time to
make arrangements for their health coverage. We expect that this
temporary extension to expire on February 28, and that as of March
1, 1999, there will be no more enrollees under a section 1395mm risk
contract.

       The fundamental change in the regulatory and legal regime also
eliminates the district court's and the court of appeals' rationale
for the highly prescriptive injunctive relief imposed in this case.
 Justifying the decision to bar the Secretary from renewing HMO risk
contracts or entering into new contracts with any HMO that violated
the procedural requirements imposed by the district court's order,
the   district   court    and   court       of   appeals   alike      relied    Section
1395mm(c) (1) 's declaration that" [t]he Secretary may not enter into

statute strongly suggests that the Secretary has flexibility in
responding to non-compliance, as it provides the Secretary with a
range of options and sanctions.              See 111 Stat. 324-325 (adding new

       3.        Following settled practice in dealing wi th moot cases here
would likewise further the interests underlying the practice.                            Here,
through no fault of the Secretary's, the case became moot pending
this     Court's       review;       the    matter    was     simply    overtaken        by    a
comprehensive legislative reform.                      In such a       circumstance,        the
Secretary ought not be bound by a judgment that she cannot appeal.
 See United States v. Munsingwear,                    340 u.S.      36, 40    (1951).     That
is especially true given the present circumstances.                            The ruling's
below address          an    issue    of    substantial national             importance,      as
respondent's lead counsel has already conceded in filings with this
Court.      See Br. Amici Curiae Of the American Association of Retired
Persons, The Center For Medicare Advocacy, Inc., et aI, in Sullivan,
supra,      at    7   (emphasizing         that,    because    "the Medicare program"
increasingly involves "beneficiary participation in private managed
care structures," the state action issue is increasingly" important
to a rapidly expanding number of individuals.").                         And the ruling,
despite the mootness of the actual controversy, threatens to have
continuing repercussions for an important federal program: HMOs may
well be deterred from participating in the new program by the Ninth
Circuit's constitutional holding.
       In    far      less    compelling           circumstances,       this     Court     has
unhesitatingly concluded that it was appropriate                             to vacate the
judgments below and remand the matter to the district court for
further proceedings in light of intervening events.                          Thus, in McLeod

injunction had been issued under Section 10 (j) of the National Labor
Relations Act because, after the lower courts passed on the issue,
a "supervening event" -- a new labor agreement -- had drawn into
question "the appropriateness of injunctive relief" vel non.                     Given
that change,    the court determined that the proper resolution was
to "set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeals with direction
to enter a new judgment setting aside the order of the District Court
and remanding to that court for such further proceedings as may be
appropriate in light of the supervening event."                         Similarly,   in
Calhoun v.Latimer, 377 u.S. 263, 265 (1964)                  (per curiam), the Court
determined that the school board's adoption of a new policy while
the case was pending on review had substantially altered the nature
of the controversy; the Court therefore "vacate [d] the judgment and
remand [ed] the cause to the District Court for further proceedings."
 Id. at 264; cf. Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 u.S.
156, 172 (1962)       (when confronted with intervening facts,                court of
appeals should not review administrative agency decision but should
vacate order and remand to agency for further consideration in light
of changed conditions).        Here, the new statute enacted by Congress
and the Secretary's new regulations promulgated thereunder likewise
fundamentally alter not only the relevant legal framework and the
nature of the dispute between the parties.                   Accordingly, a similar
order vacating the lower court judgments, and remanding the matter
to   the   district    court   for    consideration           of    those   intervening
developments,   is appropriate in this case as well. '4

     14 It is no answer to suggest that" the "state action" question
remains "live" under the new statute, even if changed facts alter
the due process analysis of the lower courts. This court reviews
judgments, not statements in opinions.       Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.

                                 CONCLUSION
     The Court should hold the petition pending decision in American
Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company v.                Sullivan,   et al.,   No.
97-2000 (argued Jan. 19, 1999).         Once the Court issues its decision
in SullJ..van, it should grant the petition, vacate the judgment below
as moot,   and remand to the court of appeals with instructions to
set aside the district court judgment and to remand the matter to
the district court for consideration of intervening statutory and
regulatory    changes    and,      to        the   extent     appropriate,     for
reconsideration in light of this Court's decision in Sullivan.


                                    Respectfully submitted.




In this case, the judgment of the district court commands the
Secretary to impose certain procedures on participating HMOs.     It
should go without saying that the change in procedures mandated by
the new statute dramatically affects the propriety of that judgment.
 After all, if the new procedures are constitutional, and no court
has determined that are not, then that judgment simply could not
be sustained. Moreover, it would ill serve the cause of judicial
economy for this Court to pass on a state action question
unnecessarily where the district court may, on remand, be able to
avoid that question through a fact-bound determination that, even
if . there were state action, then new procedures would provide
respondents with the process that is their due.
