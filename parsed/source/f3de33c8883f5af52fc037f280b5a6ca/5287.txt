                                     November 14, 1997


 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:         Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

 RE:           DPC Weekly Report



         Education: California Bilingual Education Ballot Initiative -        Opponents of
  bilingual education in California have submitted petition signatures for a baUot initiative
  that would end bilingual education programs and require that children be taught in
  English unless a parent requests bilingual instruction. DPC has been leading a White
  House and Education Department effort to monitor this situation and determine whether
  and when it might be appropriate to take a position on this initiative. Over the coming
  weeks we will continue to review the legal, educational and political issues involved, and
. present you with a detailed analysis.

        Education: Urban Education -- DPC staff met with senior representatives of several
 national organizations interested in urban education, including the Council of Great City
 Schools, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Urban League, the Rainbow
 Coalition, the AFf and NEA, and MALDEF. They were briefed on education proposals
 under consideration for FY 1999, including the CoUege-School Partnership initiative to
 increase coUege enroUment among low income and minority students by providing
 mentoring and other support service, and a standards-based reform initiative that would
 chaUenge urban districts to institute policies that end social promotions, require
 intervention in failing schools, and move incompetent teachers out of the profession. In
 general these proposals were weU received, though they provoked considerable debate
 about student accountability. The AFf felt strongly that even the mentoring initiative
 should include a requirement that students meet some academic performance
 requirements, while the civil rights groups were opposed to this in any form.




        Crime: Crime Statistics -- Tomorrow, the Justice Department will formally release
 new crime data from their annual National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The highlights
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
 of the new data were made part of this week's radio address. The survey confirms that crime is
 continuing to fall across the board and to the benefit of most Americans. Crime Victimization
 rates fell to their lowest points since the inception of the NCVS in 1973. Both the murder and
 violent crime rates plummeted 10% in 1996, and property crime rates fell 8%. The decreases
 are even more significant when viewed over time: since 1993, violent and property crime rates
 dropped 16% and 17% , respectively, and murder rates dropped a stunning 22%. Particularly
 encouraging is that during the same period, reductions in crime victimization rates were being
 experienced equally by men, women, and different racial and income groups throughout the
 country.

           Crime: Juvenile Crime Appropriations: - The final FY 98 Commerce, Justice
  Appropriations conference report contains significant new funding for our key juvenile crime
  priorities. The bill authorizes and funds a new $250 million Juvenile Accountability Incentive
  Block Grant-- 45% ($113 million) of which must be spent on prosecutors, probation officers, and
  juvenile gun and drug court programs. Our strategy and budget contained $150 million in direct
  funding for the same purposes. In addition, the FY98 Labor-HHS Appropriations conference
  report provides substantial new funding ($40 million) for afterschool programs through the 21st
  Century Schools Program at the Department of Education. We proposed $63 million for
. afterschool programs in our budget.

         Race: Race Initiative and Service - You should be aware of some interesting
 connections between the race initiative and service. The Corporation for National Service
 is about to award $225,000 in mini-grants to 70 communities to organize local days of service in
 observance of Martin Luther King Day. In 1994, Congress designated Martin Luther King
 Day as a day of service -- "a day on, not a day off" - in recognition of Dr. King's belief in
 service. Since then, more and more communities across the country have organized
 service projects that day. This is the second year that the Corporation has awarded
 grants. It received 500 applications, many more than last year.
        In addition, Harris Wofford is enthusiastic about the "Kindness and Justice
 Curriculum" being organized by a youth service group called "Do Something." The plan
 is for students across the country to do acts of kindness and justice in the two weeks
 leading up to Martin Luther King Day, discuss them in class, and post them on the Web.
 The group is sending materials to schools to encourage schools and teachers to participate,
 and it will present awards to the best programs. Dexter King, who is part of this effort,
 and others are asking us to promote the concept.

        Finally, we are also exploring potential actions in the Corporation's service-learning
 programs, where children serve together and then reflect on that experience in school, as
 well as highlighting successful AmeriCorps service projects that focus consciously on
 diversity as part of the service experience, like the CityYear program.

        Adoption: the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 -- On' Thursday, November 13,
 the Senate and the House of Representatives passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997,


                                               2
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
which represents an enonnous victory for your agenda to promote adoption and improve our
nation's child welfare system_ The legislation includes your priorities for child welfare refonn,
as outlined in your executive memorandum on adoption to members of your Cabinet (which you
issued in a radio address on December 14, 1996), and in the Adoption 2002 report that HHS
presented to you last Valentine's Day, February 14, 1997. We are working on a bill signing
ceremony with key Members of Congress, advocates and foster and adopted children in the East
Room next Thursday, November 20.

         Staff from the DPC, the First Lady's Office, and HHS have worked with bi-partisan
congressional staff on this legislation since you issued the executive memorandum on adoption
less than a year ago. As you know, Representatives Camp and Kennelly sponsored an adoption
bill which passed an bill last Spring and which you strongly endorsed. The Senate passed its
bill, sponsored by Senators Chafee and Rockefeller, on Saturday, November 8, 1997 -- after
much deliberation and negotiation. As you know, the First Lady was intimately involved,
helping to shape the substance of the legislation and making important calls to Members of
Congress (her leadership was noted in the public statements of the Members before the final
passage of the legislation).

       The legislation:
             Makes clear that children's health and safety are the paramount concems of the
              public child welfare system;
             Clarifies the "reasonable efforts" standard;
             Speeds up court hearings for children in foster care and requires that States initiate
              proceedings to tenninate parental rights after a child has been in foster care for 15
              of the previous 22 months, except in specified circumstances;
             Provides States with financial incentives to increase the number of children who
              are adopted (through bonus payments to States that increase adoptions of foster
              children above prior levels -- $4,000 for each adoption above the base number,
              plus an additional $2,000 for a total of $6,000 per special needs adoption (the full
              bonus outlined in the Adoption 2002 report);
             Directs the Secretary of HHS to rate State perfonnance on a number of factors
              including the number of adoptions and length of stay in foster care;
             Reauthorizes the Family Preservation Program (staving off an expected battle next
              year), while also expanding the goals of the program to include time-limited
              family reunification and adoption promotion and increasing its funding levels.
             Ensures health coverage for adopted children with special needs (by requiring
              states to provide coverage through Medicaid or the new child health program);
             Expands HHS authority to authorize child welfare waivers to states through child
              welfare and foster care demonstration projects (the Republicans had wanted to
              authorize unlimited waivers, and compromised at 10 additional waivers per year);
             Breaks down barriers to adoptions across State lines by making clear that States
              may not postpone or deny adoption while looking for an in-state placement when
              a suitable out-of-state adoption is possible;

                                                3
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


              Requires States to check criminal records of prospective foster or adoption parents
               (but allows Governors to request to opt out of requirement); and
              Authorizes HHS to provide $10 million per year of technical assistance to States
               to promote adoption, half of which must be used to help courts facilitate
               permanent placements.

        The bill authorizes $76 million over five years of additional funding (principally
representing an increase in the Family Preservation Program, the requirement of health coverage
for special needs adoptions, and technical assistance funding). The cost were off-set by a
temporary adjustment of contingency fund for State welfare programs, which the Congress plans
to take up next year for reform.

         Tobacco: Legislation in Congress on Tobacco - In response to your announcement of
a plan for tobacco legislation and the subsequent meeting with bipartisan Congressional leaders,
a number of bills have been introduced in the last few weeks. Senator Hatch has introduced
legislation that increases the cost of the proposed settlement from $368 billion to $397.5 billion,
raises the limits on company payments if underage smoking fails to reach target levels, but
differs with public health groups on FDA authority by not treating cigarettes as "drug delivery
devices." The bill bans future class-action suits against the companies and provides punitive
damage protection for past misconduct. Senator Kennedy's bill raises the cost ofthe settlement
to more than $600 billion, increases the tobacco tax by $1.50 over three years, and fails to
provide tobacco producers with protections against lawsuits. Senator McCain has introduced a
bill that is directly patterned on the settlement language itself. Senator Lautenberg has
introduced a bill that would cost $494 billion and give cigarette makers no relief from lawsuits.

        In addition to these comprehesive tobacco bills, more specific bills involving the
settlement have also been introduced. Several House members have legislation to limit fees
paid to attorneys involved in the settlement. Senators Ford and Lugar have bills that differ from
each other regarding the maintenance of the price support system for farmers and the buying out
of farmers' quotas. Also this week, Speaker Gingrich said the House may break the national
tobacco settlement into separate bills, such as teenage smoking and industry liability, and act on
each as a consensus emerges. Finally, Congressman Bliley held the first in a series of hearings
this week during which he publicly pressed the tobacco industry for the release of 864 documents
that are at issue in a lawsuit filed by the State of Minnesota.
