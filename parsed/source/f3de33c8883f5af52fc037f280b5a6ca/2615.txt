SCHOOL VOUCHER AMENDMENT PASSES IN THE SENATE:
During the debate on the budget resolution, the Senate passed an amendment, offered by Sen.
Lott, which provides education vouchers for children who have been the victim of violent crimes.
 The bill provides for budget authority for this provision in FY2000, but no outlays in any year.
The amendment passed by a 51-48 vote; no Democrat voted for the amendment, and four
Republicans (Chaffee, Jeffords, Collins and Spector) voted against it. Both Sen. Lott and Sen.
Dominici voted for the amendment.

The amendment was a surprise to almost everyone, and we are still not sure why it was drafted
with no budget but no outlay authority. The expectation is that it will easily be dropped in
conference. The main point seems to have been to provide an important symbolic victory. We
believe this is the first time a voucher provision has ever passed in the Senate.

NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS STUDY
Next Wednesday the Department of Education is scheduled to release the first year findings of a
planned 4-year study of charter schools and their impact on student achievement. The study
includes an annual survey of all charter schools every year for 4 years. The first year results, are
based on studies of schools in the ten states that had charter schools legislation when the study
began. Key findings include:

      Over half of all charter schools are newly created; almost one-third were pre-existing
       public schools; a little over one-tenth were pre-existing private schools.

      In most states, charter schools are at least as economically and racially diverse as the
       overall population in the state's public schools. In several states (e.g., Arizona and
       Colorado) charter schools are less diverse.

      The three most significant obstacles cited by charter school leaders are lack of start up
       funds, lack of planning time, and inadequate facilities. Only 6% said federal regulations
       were a significant barrier to getting underway.

REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA
You requested additional information in response to a May 16 Wall Street Journal article which
suggested that the overhauled IDEA does not go far enough in enabling school authorities to deal
with disruptions caused by students with disabilities.

The new bill continues to provide procedural safeguards for students with disabilities, in order to
protect their right a free and appropriate education. Within that framework, it strengthens the
ability of teachers and principals to deal with disruptive or dangerous students, including those
with disabilities. It does this by:

              making it easier for principals to remove children with disabilities who bring a
               gun, weapon or drugs to school, or who pose a danger to themselves, their

                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion



                   teachers or their classmates from the classroom, while continuing to provide them
                   with an education in another setting.
                  making it easier to address a child's behavior problems early on -- before they get
                   out of hand -- by requiring that these be considered in the development of an
                   Individual Education Plan, and by making the regular classroom teacher a part of
                   the team that develops the plan.

    These changes were worked out in a bipartisan, bicameral group that also included the
    Administration and representatives of the education and disabilities communities. While not
    ideal from anyone's point of view, it represents something that all parties could agree to.
    Especially since education has such a strong culture of regulation, especially in special education,
     the maintenance of procedural requirements for removing students with disabilities from
    school (which have been at the heart of the federal guarantee of access to education) the bill
    may be seen by some in the education community has still tying the hands of local
    administrators.
