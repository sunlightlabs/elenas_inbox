TEXT:
There is a deputies meeting on privacy today at 1 p.m. in Room 180.   Below
is the longer memo.  I have also faxed it over to you.  Here is the
prepared summary of the topics to be discussed:

Summary of policy options

1.      Privacy entity: Designate a White House policy councilor OMB to
increase coordination on privacy issues.

2.      Online privacy: Continue to press for industry self-regulation - with
the option for a legislative solution if self-regulation proves to be
inadequate.

3.       Privacy dialogue with state and local governments: Initiate a D&privacy
dialogueD8 with state and local governments about the privacy of personal
information collected by governments. Discussion could include: state
privacy laws, use of Social Security numbers, impact of new technology on
definition of D&public records.D8

4.      Public education: Work with the private sector and non-profits to
develop an advertising campaign to inform individuals about how to
exercise choice with respect to the collection and dissemination of their
personally identifiable information.

Areas of particular sensitivity

1.      Information about children: Call for legislation that would specify a
set of fair information principles applicable to the collection of data
from children (e.g. no collection of data from children under 13 without
prior parental consent) .

2.      Medical records: Call for legislation on privacy of medical records
consistent with HHS report.

3.         Financial records:

        Call for amendments to Fair Credit Reporting Act to limit the
D&affiliate sharing exception.D8 Businesses could share consumer
information for marketing purposes, but not for business decisions.   For


example, consumer information provided to an insurance affiliate could not
be used to deny a person a loan without FCRA protection.

        Authorize the Fed to write enforceable rules on inter-affiliate
information sharing.

        Determine whether Justice and FTC have adequate jurisdiction and
penalties to punish theft of personal financial information.

4.      Profiling: Call for legislation that would give the FTC the authority
to require D&profilersD8 to comply with a set of fair information
practices.  Profilers are in the business of compiling and distributing
electronic dossiers on individually identifiable consumers.

5.      Identity theft

        Endorse Kyl bill on identity theft, provided it addresses
concerns of Treasury and Justice.

6.      Social Security Numbers: Conduct a study that looks backward to discern
D&lessons learnedD8 from social security experience and looks forward to
avoid the same result with respect to new identification technologies
(e.g. biometrics).

MEMORANDUM FOR NECIDPC DEPUTIES

FROM:           Sally Katzen, Tom Kalil

RE:             July 8th Deputies meeting on privacy


       Attached is a paper on a set of policy options to address privacy issues that has been
prepared by the NEC/DPC Working Group on Privacy. This package is designed to:

      Address "cross-cutting" issues that affect a range of privacy concerns (privacy entity,
       privacy online, dialogue with state and local government, and public education);

      Target sectors or users that are particUlarly sensitive (children, medical records, financial
       records, profiling, identity theft, social security numbers);

      Address both "offline" and "online" privacy;

      Encourage self-regulation where possible and identify the need for legislation where
       necessary; and

      Maintain a balanced approach that recognizes the values associated with the free flow of
       information and with giving individuals greater control over their personally identifiable
       information.

       We would like to use the meeting tomorrow to determine where we have consensus and
whre there may be areas of disagreement. It is our intent to schedule a Principals meeting on
privacy as soon as possible.

RE:         Privacy - Legislative and Other Options


          This memorandum outlines a series of Administration proposals for enhancing privacy
. protection by acting in the folIowing areas:

  Creation of a Federal Privacy Entity
  Medical Records
  Profiling
  On-line Information About Children
  Government Information
  Credit Reporting
  Financial Industry
  Identity Theft
  Theft of Personal Information
  Public Education
. Social Security Numbers
  Commercial Marketing




                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dwnp Ccnvcl'5icn

    New technologies have made it easier to create, manipulate, store, transmit, and link digital
personally identifiable information. Many Americans believe that they have lost all control over
how personal information about them is circulated and used by companies. We can expect that
these issues will become more important and prominent with the advent of new technologies
such as the Internet, electronic commerce, and data mining.

    Privacy concerns often, however, have to be accommodated with competing values - such as
prevention of crime, prosecution of criminals, cracking down on "deadbeat parents," free
expression, an investigatory press, and the economic and commercial benefits that come from the
free flow of information.

    Attempting to centralize privacy policy development within the Administration would not
make any sense. Inevitably, many agencies will have to deal with some aspect of privacy policy
-- Education on student records, HHS on medical records, Transportation on Intelligent
Transportation Systems, etc.

    There is, however, an increased need for coordination across agency lines, precisely because
privacy is a cross-cutting issue. This would be particularly helpful in the following four areas:

       Representational- Better explain and promote the Administration's privacy policy
       domestically and internationally. Currently, the United States is not represented in many
       important international fora on privacy.

       Consumer Information - Increase public awareness of privacy issues and the rights and
       responsibilities of consumers, industry, and government. Use the "bully pulpit" to
       encourage best practices and criticize bad actors.

       Advisory - Provide/coordinate advice on privacy policy questions to government agencies
       and the private sector.

       Coordination - Ensure that agencies are addressing emerging privacy issues, and ensure
       greater consistency of Administration positions and policies.

   Option

    The Administration could create a Federal privacy entity located in the Executive Office of
the President.

    There are advantages and disadvantages to putting it in OMB, making it a new White House
office, or putting it under one of the existing White House policy councils. Since shaping
privacy policy requires accommodating different interests, it would be better if it were located in

                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
"privacy advocate" would be counter-productive.

   The entity should have a small staff -- since the intent is to have it playa coordinating role as
opposed to an operational role.


                                     HEALTH INFORMATION

    The confidentiality of health information is a matter of widespread national concern, and the
protection of this information has been a priority of the Administration. On September 11,
1997, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala recommended that Congress enact
Federal legislation to protect the confidentiality of health information by imposing duties on
those who hold such information and providing rights to the subjects of the information. She
proposed that the Federal law provide a floor of protection, and that States be permitted to, in
addition, provide stronger protections.

    Under the recommended legislation, health care providers, those who pay for health care, and
those who get information from those entities would have to permit patients to see their own
records, to keep records of disclosures and let patients know who has seen their records, and to
permit patients to file proposals for correction of erroneous records. All entities collecting or
maintaining information would have to advise patients clearly of their confidentiality practices
and of the patients' rights.

    Disclosures would be limited to those authorized by the patient, or those specifically
permitted in the legislation, including disclosures for important public purposes, such as
treatment and payment, research, public health, oversight of the health care system, and use in
law enforcement or other legal proceedings if permitted by other law. There would be strict
limitations on further disclosure in many of these instances. Within an organization,
information could be used only for purposes reasonably related to the purposes for which it was
gathered, and all disclosures would have to be limited to the minimum necessary to accomplish
the purpose of the disclosure.

    Entities receiving information pursuant to patient authorization would have to give patients a
statement of their intended use of the information, and would be civilly liable for uses in
violation of that statement.

    There would be civil and criminal sanctions for violations, such as improper disclosure and
obtaining information under false pretenses.

   Congress is now considering the recommendations.




                                                 3              Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


    Commercial "profilers" build dossiers about individuals by aggregating information from a
variety of database sources, including public and non-public records. Individual reference
services, sometimes called look-up services, represent a sub-set of the profiling industry. These
services provide information that assists users in identifying individuals, locating individuals,
and verifying identities.

   Best Practices Model - Individual Reference Services Group

    On December 17, 1997, a group of 14 Individual Reference Services (the Individual
Reference Services Group, IRSG) entered into an agreement on privacy practices with the
Federal Trade Commission. The IRSG program is based on compliance with certain principles,
including notice, disclosure, choice, security, and public education. IRSG members agreed to
acquire personal information only from reputable sources, to take reasonable steps to assure that
data collected is accurate, complete and timely for the purpose for which it will be used, to
correct non-public records when appropriate, and to limit distribution of non-public information
to subscribers with appropriate intended uses.

    The IRSG committed to implement a rigorous enforcement compliance method. The
enforcement program has two prongs. First, signatories' practices are subject to review by a
"reasonably qualified independent professional service." On the basis of established criteria, that
entity determines whether a signatory is in compliance with IRSG principles. The results of the
annual review are made public. Second, signatories who are information suppliers may not sell
information to look-up services that do not comply with the IRSG principles.

    The IRSG members agreed to provide individuals with access to information contained in
services and products that specifically identify them, unless the information comes from a public
record, in which case the companies will provide the individuals with guidance on how they can
obtain the information from the original source. FTC staff strongly disagreed with the access
provisions of the IRSG practices, and the Commission and IRSG agreed to allow 18 months
before revisiting the access issue. On the basis of the IRSG program and the commitment to
review access issues, the FTC advised the Congress that legislation on individual reference
services was premature.

   Legislative Option

    The Administration could embrace the IRSG approach and apply it more broadly by
supporting legislation giving the FTC authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to require those
in the business of compiling and distributing (or re-using for marketing purposes) electronic
dossiers on individually identifiable consumers to comply with a specified set offair information
practices. The grant of authority to the FTC could include a "safe harbor" provision -- profilers

the FTC would be presumed to be in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission Act.


                           ON-LINE INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN

    The solicitation of information from children presents a unique problem. Unlike adults,
children generally lack the ability to provide legally binding consent and may not be cognitively
capable of understanding the consequences of giving out personally identifiable information
online. Many companies presently collect information from children for a variety of reasons --
to contact a child to verify that they may have won a prize, to monitor children in chat rooms, for
statistical purposes or for direct marketing purposes.

    On June 4,1998, the Federal Trade Commission released a report to Congress, Privacy
Online, which surveyed 1,400 Web sites. Eighty-nine percent of children's sites surveyed
collect personal information from children. Although 54% of children's sites provide some
form of disclosure of their information practices, the Commission found that few sites take any



IDENTITY THEFT

       The term Aidentity theft@ generally refers to the fraudulent use of another person's
identity to facilitate the commission of a crime, such as credit card fraud. To commit
identity fraud, a criminal gathers information about a person and then uses the
information to adopt the identity of a victim.

       Under existing law, identity theft offenses are punished to the extent that they
include identification documents (i.e., forged or stolen documents) and an intent to defraud
the United States. Yet existing law does not reach identity theft that makes use of other
means of identification, such as a social security number or a mother's maiden name.

        For this reason, it would be helpful to change the law to recognize the potential
harm that could be done by offenders who commit identity theft with means of
identification, and to address other problems that have emerged as a result of a dramatic
increase in cases of identity theft.

       At the same time, legislation to criminalize identity theft must be carefully crafted to
avoid problems that could arise from the federalization of a large new class of crimes.

Senator Kyl is in the process of marking up S. 512, the Identity Theft and Assumption
Deterrence Act of 1997. After raising initial technical concerns about this bill, Departments of
Treasury and Justice have worked to provide amendments (to be considered during markup) that
would address any outstanding concerns.

       Recommendation

of sites even direct children to seek parental permission before providing personal information.
Only 7% of the sites said they would notify parents of their information practices, and less than
10 % provide for parental control over the collection and/or use of information from children.
The Commission recommended that Congress adopt legislation protecting children's privacy
online.

    Best Practices Model - Online Privacy Alliance

    On June 22, 1998 the Online Privacy Alliance issued specific guidelines for the protection of
children's' privacy online.

    Alliance members that operate sites directed at children under 13 have agreed (I) not to
collect online contact information from a child under 13 without prior parental consent or direct
parental notification of the nature and intended use of this information, induding an option for
the parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the activity; (2) to assure that
information collected will only be used to directly respond to the child's request and will not be

individually identifiable offline contact information from children under 13 without prior
parental consent; (4) not to distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information
collected from a child under 13 without prior parental consent; (5) not to give children under 13
the ability to post or otherwise distribute individually identifiable contact information without
prior parental consent - sites directed to children under 13 must take best efforts to prohibit a
child from posting contact information; and (6) not to entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a
special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in
that activity.

    Legislative Option

    The Administration has endorsed the FTC call for legislation with respect to children's'
privacy online. The Adminis.tration could call for legislation that would specify a set offair
information practices applicable to the collection of data from children and give the FTC
authority to promulgate rules based on such standards. The grant of authority to the FTC could
include a safe harbor provision - data collectors who belong to a self regulatory organization

postal service change-of-address records, voter registration records, bankruptcy and lien records,

identity to facilitate the commission of a crime, such as credit card fraud. To commit
identity fraud, a criminal gathers information about a person and then uses the
information to adopt the identity of a victim.

       Under existing law, identity theft offenses are punished to the extent that they
include identification documents (i.e., forged or stolen documents) and an intent to defraud
the United States. Yet existing law does not reach identity theft that makes use of other
means of identification, such as a social security number or a mother's maiden name.

        For this reason, it would be helpful to change the law to recognize the potential
harm that could be done by offenders who commit identity theft with means of
identification, and to address other problems that have emerged as a result of a dramatic

    Companies that share consumer information with their affiliates are not subject to the
controls of the FCRA. Based on the above definitions, these companies are not considered
"credit reporting agencies" because they are not providing the reports to a third party, but rather
to themselves. Additionally, the information shared is not considered a "credit report" because
the information is not compiled by a "credit reporting agency." The FCRA, moreover,
specifically excludes affiliate sharing from the definition of "credit report."

    The exclusion of affiliate sharing from the credit report definition and further regulation by
the FCRA was debated during the 1996 Amendments to the FCRA. The FTC strongly argued
that consumer information shared by affiliates should be subject to the protections of the FCRA.
The banking industry argued the opposite. The banking industry won; the FCRA specifically
excludes the information shared by affiliates from the definition of consumer report.

opposition to this issue, this proposal may be extremely difficult to effectuate. The FTC would
probably, however, support repeal of the affiliate sharing exemption.

  . Study Option

    As more databases are available directly to companies, and companies themselves share
information directly, there is some concern that the FCRA may become outdated and obsolete.
Companies, for example, will no longer purchase credit reports from a central bureau, but rather
will obtain information directly from the individual sources and created their own internal credit
reports. In the absence of traditional credit reporting agencies, the protections of the FCRA
would evaporate. The Administration could undertake a study to determine whether the FCRA
contains the protections needed in the electronic age.

marketing purposes (e.g., a credit card bank soliciting an affiliate broker-dealer's best customers
for a new platinum card) but also for security purposes (e.g., tracking a credit card holder's
spending patterns in order to detect immediately any unusual activity that might indicate fraud or
theft) and increasingly for risk-management purposes (e.g., a customer's record of payment on a
credit card apparently is quite useful in determining whether that customer is a good risk for auto
insurance). Such practices can be expected to continue, as the lines between various types of
financial services firms continue to blur and the firms continue to merge.

affiliate information sharing of personal information other than "experience" or "transactional"
information (which may be shared not only with affiliates but also third parties). For example, a
customer can prevent personal information contained in an account application from being

marketing purposes but not for fraud prevention or risk management purposes. This limited
right was also brokered as part of the 1996 Amendments to the FCRA.

for compliance with the Act; rather, they must await a complaint or other indication of trouble.
The banking regulatory agencies also are prevented from issuing regulations under the Act, but

    The Administration could seek legislation that makes it illegal to record social security
numbers on a check that is being approved for a purchase. This would mirror a law that was
passed several years ago that prohibited the recording of a credit card number onto a check when
the credit card was used as a piece of identification. Such legislation would neither make it
illegal for a merchant to ask for the identification, nor indicate that such a check occurred. The
law would merely prohibit writing the actual social security number on the check. Note,
however, that modem "telecheck" technology permits merchants to ensure that a personal check
is good without a Social Security number.

protect or disclose most personal infonnation. Many Americans are unaware of how their
personal infonnation is used, and they do not understand how to protect themselves or exercise
their ability to choose. Likewise, many businesses are unaware of consumer concerns about
privacy and have not thought through their infonnation handling practices in light of this
concern.

to infonn individuals about how to exercise choice with respect to the collection and
dissemination of their personally identifiable infonnation. Such a campaign could include all
advertising mediums - radio, television, print, and electronic.

    The use of Social Security number by the private sector in connection with a variety of
transactions allows profilers, marketers and others to combine discrete bits of information to
create a portrait of an individual. These portraits have legitimate uses -- law enforcement, credit
assessments, debt collection, etc. -- and we therefore must tread cautiously to avoid upsetting an
information structure that is fairly well established. The FTC recently indicated to Congress that
the use of a unique identifier like Social Security numbers may contribute significantly to the
accuracy of these portraits. In addition, the FTC indicated that "the cat may be out of the bag"
with respect to private sector use of social security numbers.

       Under existing law, identity theft offenses are punished to the extent that they

the United States. Yet existing law do'es not reach identity theft that makes use of other
means of identification, such as a social security number or a mother's maiden name.

        For this reason, it would be helpful to change the law to recognize the potential
harm that could be done by offenders who commit identity theft with means of
identification, and to address other problems that have emerged as a result of a dramatic
increase in cases of identity theft.

       At the same time, legislation to criminalize identity theft must be carefully crafted to
avoid problems that could arise from the federalization of a large new class of crimes.

    The marketing industry has made progress by adopting robust statements offair information
practices, but effective self-regulatory enforcement mechanisms are just beginning to emerge.

     The Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) announced on June 22, 1998, that it will
develop and implement a major privacy program through its subsidiary, BBBOnLine.
According to the CBBB press release, the online privacy program will feature: privacy

    Legislative Option

    The Administration could call for legislation that would specify a set of fair information
practices applicable to commercial marketers and give the FTC authority to promulgate rules
based on such standards. The grant of authority to the FTC could include a safe harbor
provision - marketers who belong to a self regulatory organization operating in accordance with
practices approved by the FTC would be presumed to be in compliance with the Federal Trade
Commission Act.
