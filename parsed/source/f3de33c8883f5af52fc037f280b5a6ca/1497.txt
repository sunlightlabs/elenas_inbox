MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:      GUIDANCE TO STATES REGARDING TWO WELFARE REFORM ISSUES

        States are currently seeking guidance on two welfare reform issues: whether they can
privatize certain administrative functions of the Food Stamp and Medicaid programs, and
whether worker protection laws -- particularly the minimum wage (Fair Labor Standards Act) --
apply to work programs under the new welfare law.

Privatizing Food Stamp and Medicaid Administration

       The new welfare law explicitly allows states to contract with private entities to
administer Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (T ANF). Now, Texas wants to
contract out not only T ANF but Food Stamps and Medicaid as well and Wisconsin wants to
do so for T ANF and Food Stamps. Federal approval for these requests will establish a
policy for other states as well.

        The states that want t~ privatize believe that a competitive contracting process will
result in greater program efficiencies while protecting recipients. (Private contractors
determining eligibility for Medicaid and Food Stamps would have to follow federal.
eligibility rules, since those programs remain federally guaranteed individual entitlements.)
 Organized labor is concerned that privatizing government functions will displace state
and local government workers (with a resulting loss of union membership). They also
charge that it will undermine quality and beneficiary rights to due process and
confidentiality. They fear that private firms will have an incentive to "cut comers" if they
determine eligibility for benefits.

     We all believe that allowing some privatization makes sense -- the question is how
much. Below, after some additional background information, we outline a
recommendation for your consideration.

Background
        Federal agencies and the state of Texas have been negotiating since June 1996 over
the state's proposal to privatize the administration of TANF, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and
certain other federally-funded nutrition programs. The state legislature passed the plan
with bipartisan support, with endorsements from Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and Comptroller
John Sharp. Under the Texas plan, private contractors would conduct the interview and
eligibility determination process, and the state would certify the final determinations. The
State also would retain control over the appeals and quality control processes. An
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                   2

estimated 15,000 state jobs would be eliminated or transferred to the private sector. The
state would require bidders to comment on whether they plan to hire displaced government
workers.
         Texas state officials are becoming increasingly impatient with HHS and USDA for
not yet having ruled on their proposal. In a recent letter to HHS, state officials threatened
to proceed with the project without Federal approval. State officials also point out that
they have pledged to reinvest the savings from their plan in additional health and human
services programs, and that these savings could provide health coverage for 150,000 Texas
children. Rep. Charlie Stenholm, one of the Administration's strongest welfare reform
allies, complained about the delay to Frank Raines in a February 24th letter, saying the
state of Texas is "willing to make accommodations to address administration concerns."
Secretary Shalala has promised Texas an answer by April 1.

        If the Administration does not allow private contracting for Food Stamps and
Medicaid, then states may drop plans to contract out TANF, since having separate
eligibility systems creates administrative difficulties. For example, it would require some
individuals to go to one location to apply for T ANF and another to apply for Food Stamps
and Medicaid. Having a one-stop eligibility center would mean it would have to run by
the government.

Recommendation
        Clearly, certain functions should continue to be performed by government employees --
appeals, due process, and the certification of eligibility itself, and the Texas proposal does
reserve these functions for government. Other "back office" functions can easily be privatized.
The question is where to draw the line in the functions that remain: the application process and
the interview. We should also ensure that contractors do not have perverse incentives to deny
benefits or allow excessive benefits.

         We recommend that we give the state guidance that makes it clear that the eligibility
determination itself must remain in the hands of public employees, but that the application,
interview, and other information-gathering can be done by private employees. This is consistent
with our current policy that allows private hospital workers to do initial Medicaid eligibility
work, up to the point of the eligibility determination. Under this scenario, we would allow the
state to proceed to the next step: release of the "request for offers" to potential bidders. We will
then have the opportunity to review the details of contract as the state selects a bidder.

        Given the strong bipartisan support for the Texas proposal, it is not credible for the
Federal government to assert that we are uniquely capable of identifying and defending the best
interests of clients. (We should note that, in recent weeks, there have been some concerns raised
by Democrats in the state legislature that the proposal may go too far.) Ifwe deny the Texas
proposal, Governor Bush will complain loudly that we are simply protecting union jobs while
costing the state taxpayers money. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the unions' concerns
about quality and erosion of clients' rights are valid, and it should be possible to construct the
contract so that firms don't have a financial incentive to deny benefits to clients.
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                               3

Application of Labor Laws

       As states begin to redesign their work programs to meet the increasing work
participation rates in the new welfare law, a critical question for both the labor movement
imd the states is whether worker protection laws -- particularly the minimum wage law
(Fair Labor Standards Act) -- protect welfare recipients who take part in workfare or
subsidized employment programs. For the Administration, there are questions of both
law (do we believe the law requires such worker protections to apply?) and of policy (do we
want these protections to apply?).

Background
       A review conducted by the White House and relevant agencies has concluded that
current law requires the payment of at least the minimum wage to most people in workfare
and wage supplementation programs. On this reading, participants in such programs
usually would count as "employees" under the Act, thus qualifying for minimum wage
protection. (A few might count as "trainees," not entitled to the minimum wage, under
normal labor law principles that apply in other circumstances as well.) In addition, the
interagency group believes OSHA, unemployment insurance, and anti-discrimination laws
will apply to welfare workers in the same way they do for other workers. The Treasury
Department has not yet decided whether monies paid to these welfare recipients will be
subject to FICA and other taxes, and we unfortunately do not believe the IRS will rule for
several weeks.

        Legally, the interagency group believes no other interpretation is possible, since the
new welfare reform law -- unlike past reform statutes -- is silent on the issue. Therefore
the existing labor laws must apply to the extent that welfare recipients meet the established
definition of "employee." Previous welfare reform laws exempted work programs from
certain worker protection laws. The 1988 Family Support Act, for example, required
states to pay the minimum wage for work programs but explicitly said that they need not
confer employee status to such workers. States did not need to pay more than the usual
grant amount for individuals in workfare because the law required individuals to work
only as many hours as their grant, divided by the minimum wage, would dictate, and it did
not allow states to subsidize private jobs by more than the usual grant amount.

Administration Position
        Thus, we believe that current law requires the application of worker protections to
welfare-to-work programs. Bruce has given the AFL private assurances that the
Administration will adopt this basic position, and the Vice President dropped some strong
hints to the same effect at the recent AFL meeting. Many governors will be very unhappy
with this result and they may implore the Congress to enact certain exceptions. Thus, the
Administration is likely to be faced with the policy question of whether we would oppose
any worker protection exemptions for welfare-to-work programs.

        We should expect the announcement of Administration policy to provoke strong
criticism from the states. On March 3rd, Governor Whitman wrote to the President
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                4

saying that applying minimum wage laws to workfare participants would "end welfare
reform as we know it" by placing states in the position of either failing to meet the law's
work requirements or incurring large new costs. Even The New York Times editorial
board, in discussing union plans to organize workfare participants, has opined that "what
they are doing does not amount to a job" -- a view consistent with what many States and
members of Congress believe. (Many expect welfare workers to be eligible to unionize.
Recent newspaper articles have suggested that some unions will undertake large-scale
organizing efforts targeting welfare recipients, and we probably should expect some of
these efforts to succeed.)

        The states are only partly right that the minimum wage will increase their costs.
Requiring the minimum wage will not make it more expensive for states to help welfare
recipients find unsubsidized private sector jobs, nor will it make it more expensive for
states to subsidize private sector jobs. But the minimum wage will increase the costs for
some states to run public sector workfare programs. Here's why:

       ·   In many states, the current cash welfare benefit will fall short of a minimum
           wage salary for 20 hours a week of work. As the work requirement in the law
           increases to 25 and then to 30 hours, and as the minimum wage also increases,
           more and more states will discover that their welfare grants are insufficient.

       ·   Some of these states will be helped by the fact they can use food stamps as
           payment for workfare for everyone but families with children under age six.
           (Current law allows food stamps to be used to subsidize private sector jobs for
           any food stamp recipient; however, only parents with children at least age six
           can be required to work in exchange for their food stamp benefits in a workfare
           program. Only time-limited waivers have been granted in the past).

       ·   Allowing states to count the value of other benefits -- child care, housing, or
           transportation -- toward the minimum wage would remove this problem, but
           this proposal raises a number of legal and policy questions that make it difficult
           (though not impossible) to pursue.

        Even if both T ANF and food stamp benefits are counted toward the minimum wage,
a number of Southern states will immediately come up short. As the minimum wage
increases and the work requirements become more severe, other states will join them over
time. This expense will encourage state efforts to find private sector jobs for welfare
recipients -- a policy we believe is justifiable. But it will make it more difficult for some
states to use public sector jobs as a last resort to help meet the work rates, thus making
many low-income Southern states susceptible to financial penalties.
