 TEXT:
 Here's a writeup of a race town hall. After you've looked at it; let me
 know what you think we should do next.  I am trying to get a read from
 Mike Cohen and Bill Kincaid on whether they think the Kindness/Justice
 curriculum is too goofy.



 Race Town Hall -- Service and Youth

 Goal:
 As part of the PresidentO,s dialogue with Americans on race, we would
 focus on community service and examine its potential to bridge the divide
 among people. When people serve together, it strengthens their sense of
 interdependence and responsibility for one another. This is particularly
 true of young people. Many young people participate in
 D&service-Iearning08 programs in school, where they serve together and
 then reflect on that experience.

 Potential Announcements:
  The President could announce $250,000 in mini-grants to xxx communities
 to organize local days of service in observance of Martin Luther King
 Day.  In 1994, Congress designated Martin Luther King Day as a day of
 service -- O&a day on, not a day off" -- in recognition of Dr. KingO,s
 belief in service.  Since then, more and more communities across the
 country have organized service projects that day. This is the second year
 that the Corporation has awarded grants.  It received 500 applications,
 many more than last year.   The President could also announce that he
 plans to participate in a service project in honor of MLK Day next year.

  We are examining the possibility that the President could embrace the
 D&Kindness and Justice Curriculum08 being organized by 0&00 Something,08 a
 youth service group.  Do SomethingO,s plan is for students across the
 country to 0&commit08 acts of kindness and justice in the two weeks
 leading up to Martin Luther King Day, discuss them in class, and post them
 on the Web.  The group is sending materials to schools to encourage
 schools and teachers to participate, and it will present awards to the
 best programs.

  We could announce an expansion of service-learning programs that focus on
 diversity.

  We could also explore the possibility of inviting Colin Powell to
 participate in the town hall.   Powell now chairs AmericaO,s Promise, the
 organization designated to follow up on. the PresidentsO, service summit
 held last April.



 Format of Town Hall Program
 We should select a site with significant AmeriCorps and/or service
 learning programs.  In advance of the event, we would arrange a service
 project for participants in the town hall.

  Architects of local AmeriCorps service projects that focus consciously on
 diversity as part of the service experience wbuld explain what they do and
 what problems they face. [The best programs in this vein are City Year and
 public Allies, but they may not have programs in the regions of the
 country being considered for the town hall.]  Young people from different
 backgrounds who have served in such programs could talk about their
 experience serving together, the good and the bad.

  We could have K-12 students and teachers from successful service-learning
 programs talk about what works.  We should focus on programs that ensure
 that those serving are a diverse group, and not simply a reflection of the
 population of the school.

  The President could challenge communities to participate in MLK Day, and
 he could challenge schools to participate in the Kindness/Justice
 Curriculum.
