                         Questions and Answers on the TobaccoHex-Dump Conversion
                                   November 5, 1997



Q:   Do you see any signs that Congress will pass your comprehensive tobacco legislation?

A:   Yes. There are promising signs that Congress will come together in a bipartisan fashion
     and pass tobacco legislation in the upcoming year. Shortly after I announced my plan for
     the reduction of youth smoking we had a meeting with the leaders of both the House and
     the Senate on this issue -- Republicans and Democrats -- and the response was very
     positive. Protecting our children is a goal we can all agree on. Several Senators have
     said they intend to introduce legislation, and there is a consensus that we have a unique
     opportunity if we act right now to control teen smoking.

     Of course, this is a complicated issue. It needs to be studied carefully. But we have
     great hopes that the Administration and Congress can work together to enact bipartisan
     legislation in the near future.



Q:   As the tobacco legislation moves through Congress, what are the elements you will not
     compromise on?

A:   When I announced my plan in September, I made clear that this was not about money, it
     was about children, and keeping teenagers from smoking. I will not compromise on that.
      To get the level of smoking reduced, I proposed a plan with five key elements:

    A comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties if targets are not
     met, a public education and counter advertising campaign, and expanded efforts to restrict
     the access of youth to tobacco products;

    Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products;

    Changes in the way industry does business, including broad document disclosure;

    Progress toward other public health goals, including reduction of second-hand smoke,
     expansion of smoking cessation programs, strengthening of international efforts, and
     funding for health research and other health objectives; and

    Protection for tobacco fanners and their communities.

     I think we need these elements to have an effective plan.

                                                                          ex- ump Conversion


Q:   What will happen if we fail to seize this opportunity?

A:   If current trends continue and nothing is done to curtail tobacco use in America, we can
     expect an additional 25 million painful and premature deaths among currently living
     Americans, including five million of our children. On average, smokers who die from
     smoking-related diseases will lose an average 12 years oflife, resulting in medical
     expenditures of$50 billion per year.


Q:   Why has tobacco become such an important issue to this Administration?

A:   We've been working on this for two years now. Each day 3000 young people become
     regular smokers, replacing many of the adult smokers who have quit or died. As the
     20th century comes to a close, we need to"right our past wrongs" and bring to a close a
     century of neglect in dealing with the greatest preventable cause of death in our society.
     We need to protect our children from being seduced, and then addicted, and finally
     afflicted. We need to enter the 21 st century with policies and programs in place which
     treat tobacco commensurate with the harm that it causes.
