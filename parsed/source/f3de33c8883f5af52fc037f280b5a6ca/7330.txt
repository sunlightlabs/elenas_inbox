Draft Proposals Regarding Reform to the H-IB Visa Program

The Administration has committed to pursuing both reforms to the H-IB visa
program and increased training opportunities for u.S. workers as part of
any legislation that would temporarily raise the annual cap on H-IB
visas. The following are some draft proposals for reform of the H-IB visa
program.



I.      Recruitment and Non-displacement of United States Workers Prior
to Seeking Nonimmigrant Workers


(a) IN GENERAL -- Section 212(n) (l)of the Immigration and Nationality Act
(8 U.S.C. 1182(n) (1)) is amended by inserting at the end the following new
subparagraph:

(E) (I) The employer, prior to filing the application, has taken good
faith, timely and significant steps to recruit and retain sufficient U.S.
workers in the specialty occupation in which the non-immigrant whose
services are being sought will be employed. Good faith steps to recruit
and retain shall be defined as:

(a)     the employer taking the following two actions in a manner
reasonably designed to recruit and retain U.S. workers:

(i)     widespread advertising of the relevant job openings to both
current and prospective employees (e.g., through AmericaO,s Job Bank,
participation in job fairs, the Internet, employer newsletters and
electronic communications, general circulation publications, professional
journals and magazines)" and
(ii)    offering meaningful monetary incentives to applicants (such as
paying above the prevailing wage, paying bonuses, or providing stock
options) above those already included in the base compensation package; or
offering training subsidies, or a training program, that provides the
means for its current employees to enhance their skills to qualify for
jobs in the specialty occupation in which the nonimmigrant will be (or is)
employed; and

(b)     The employer did not receive applications from any U.S worker
with at least substantially equivalent qualifications and experience to
the temporary foreign worker offered employment; or (ii) offered
employment to a U.S. worker with at least substantially equivalent
qualifications and experience to the temporary foreign worker offered


employment, but the offer of employment to the U.S. worker was refused;
and

(c)     Offering compensation at least at the amount required by
subparagraph (A).

  (E) (II) The recruitment requirements of this subparagraph shall not
 'apply to aliens with extraordinary ability, aliens who are outstanding
  professors and researchers, and certain multinational executives and
'managers described in section 203(b) (1).   The recruitment requirements of
  this subparagraph shall also not apply to a scientist, mathematician, or
  engineer who has attained at least a masterO,s degree or its equivalent in
  a scientific or engineering discipline, and who is coming temporarily to
  the United States to participate in a cooperative joint scientific
  activity carried out under an Agreement between the Federal Government and
  the alienO,s Government.

States worker, including a worker obtained by contract, employee leasing,
temporary help agreements, or otherwise displace any United States worker,
including a worker obtained by contract, employee leasing, temporary help
agreement, or other similar basis, who has substantially equivalent
qualifications and experience in the specialty occupation in which the
nonimmigrant will be (or is) employed; and

(F) (II) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term O&laid off,08
with respect to an employee, means the employeeD,s loss of employment,
other than a discharge for cause or a voluntary departure or voluntary
retirement.   The term D&laid off 08 does not apply to any case in which
employment is relocated to a different geographic area and the affected
employee is offered a chance to move to the new location with the same
wages and benefits, but elects not to move to the new location.

(G)     The employer offered compensation as required by subparagraph
(A) .

VIII.   New Visa Category Proposal

A new program (H-1C) that creates temporary visas for use only by
non-immigrants with very high skill levels.  In particular:

00      The program would be authorized for four years beginning in
FY1998.

00      There would be a maximum of 25,000 visas for FY1998, FY1999, and
FY2000, and a maximum of 15,000 visas for FY2001.

Only employers whose number of H-1B and 0&H-1C08 employees in the prior
year constitutes no greater than one-half of their U.S. based workforce
are eligible to apply.

00      Only individuals with a minimum of a masterD,s degree (or
equivalent degree) in math, science, or engineering; or a bachelorO,s
degree in math, science, or engineering and five years of experience in
the specialty occupation; or who will earn at least $75,000 per year
(exclusive of benefits) are eligible for an D&H-IC08 visa.
  ..
DO      Requires a $500 fee for each position for which an application
is filed for training, enforcement, and administration of the program.

DO      The D&H-1CD8 visas would be issued for a 3-year period, and
renewable for an additional 3 years.

DO      All of the requirements of the O&H-1C08 visa program would be
the same as would exist under the reformed H-IB program.
