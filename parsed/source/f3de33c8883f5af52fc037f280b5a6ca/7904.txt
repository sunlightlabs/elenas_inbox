                        Canadian Experience Proves that Significant
                         Price Increase will Reduce Youth Smoking


The Canadian Experience Illustrates that Youth Smoking is Responsive to Large Price
Increases

      The experience of Canada during the 1980s illustrates the profound impact that large
       price increases can have on youth smoking.

      In 1981, youth smoking was pervasive in Canada -- 43.5% of Canadian teens were
       current smokers (defined as having smoked in the last thirty days). The youth smoking
       rate during this period was about 50% higher than in the U.S.

      Over the next decade, Canada significantly increased the price of cigarettes. From 1981
       to 1989, the price increased by about 90%.

      These price increases were associated with enormous declines in teen smoking. From
       1981 to 1989, Canadian teen smoking rates fell from 43.5% to 22.6%, a decline of almost
       50%.

      The large declines in Canadian youth smoking rates are largely the result of price
       increases, as opposed to other initiatives designed to curb teen smoking. From 1981 to
       1989, Canada did not adopt changes to public policy in order to reduce teen smoking
       other than price increases.

The Tobacco Industry Agrees that Youths Are Price Responsive

      Recently released internal documents from Philip Morris demonstrate that the tobacco
       industry has known for years that youths are very responsive to price. One document,
       dated September 17, 1981, states "it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the
       smoking prevalence of teenagers". Another Philip Morris strategic planning document
       from the early 1990s states: "There is no question that increasing taxes will cause a
       decrease in smoking. This point is best illustrated by the present situation in Canada."
       In another document dated September 3, 1987, a Philip Morris analysis of price increases
       concluded: "price increases ... prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke ...
       We don't need to have that happen again."

The Scientific Consensus is Clear: Youths Are Price Responsive

      There is now a substantial scientific consensus that youth smoking is responsive to price
       -- for every 10% rise in price, youth smoking declines by 6-7%.
