TEXT:
Below is the draft House Floor SAP for the Interior FY99 Appropriations
bill. The House is expected to take up the bill around lOam Tuesday
morning. Therefore, we need your comments/clearance no later than 9:30am
Tuesday. Thanks.

H.R. 4193 -- DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
  AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana; Regula (R), Ohio)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
Administration's views on H.R. 4193, the Department of the Interior and
Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999. Your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.

         The Administration urges the House to pass a clean bill that does
not attempt to roll back environmental protections and circumvent the
proper public process by attaching riders to appropriation bills.
Regrettably, the Committee bill under-funds priority programs and includes
damaging riders, such as the provision concerning the Interior Columbia
Basin Ecosystem Management Project.   In addition, it is our understanding
that, if adopted, the rule for consideration of the bill will permit a
single Member to strike all funding for the National Endowment for the
Arts.   Based on these concerns, if the Committee bill, as modified by the
rule and associated motion, were presented to the President, the
PresidentD,s senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate certain of the President's priorities within the 302(b}
allocation such as funding for national park operations. However, the
allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary investments in
programs funded by this bill. As a result, a variety of critical programs
are under-funded.  The only way to achieve the appropriate investment
level is to offset discretionary spending by using savings in other
areas.  The President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary
spending for FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by
making savings in mandatory and other programs available to help finance
this spending.  In the Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad,
bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface
transportation programs together with mandatory offsets. The
Administration urges the Congress to consider such mandatory proposals for
other priority discretionary programs.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the Committee
bill. We look forward to working with the House to resolve these concerns
as the bill moves forward.

Departments of the Interior and Agriculture

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's funding of
maintenance programs, particularly those for health and safety, in
Interior's land management agencies.  However, the Administration strongly
objects to inadequate funding provided by the Committee for high priority
programs within the Department of the Interior and the Department of
Agriculture, including Committee actions that would:

  reduce by more than half the $270 million requested from the Land and


Water Conservation Fund to protect our national parks, forests, refuges,
and public lands, with Everglades land acquisition funds cut by 75
percent. This drastic reduction in funding would prevent the
Administration from making significant land acquisitions such as
Cumberland Island National Seashore in Georgia and West Eugene Wetland in
Oregon;

 provide no funding for the Millennium program protecting artifacts of our
National heritage (see discussion below);

 deny most of the requested $128 million increase for Interior and the
Forest Service to implement the Clean Water Action Plan;

 fail to provide the requested $15 million for the Disaster Information
Network providing enhanced data to protect Americans;

 deny $29 million of the $36 million increase requested for the Endangered
Species funding, including landowner incentive grants;

 fail to provide requested increases for the Bureau of Indian Affairs
education operations and construction, the Indian Country law enforcement
initiative, and the land consolidation' pilot project and other trust
system reforms;

 provide little or no funding elsewhere in California for hazardous fuels
reduction due to excessive funds made available to the "Quincy Library
Group," in California;

 make significant reductions to the Forest Service's Wildlife and
Fisheries Management, Rangeland Management, and Watershed Improvement
programs, which would limit rangeland vegetative restoration and limit
watershed improvements with approximately 12,250 fewer watershed acres
protected or restored; and,

 eliminate the Forest Service's Stewardship Incentive Program and
significantly reduce its Forest Legacy Program.  Both of these programs
support local communities and private landowners and effectively leverage
Federal funds.

        Forest Service General Administration. The rule would shift $67 million
from General Administration to wildland fire suppression. This is
unnecessary since the Committee mark is at the request level and a $250
million contingency is available for use if necessary.   Such a transfer
would deprive individual national forests of important on-the-ground
natural resource management capability, delay needed Forest Service
computer system and financial accountability improvements, and unwisely
eliminate key agency leadership positions.

        Priority Land Acquisition Funding. The Administration objects to the
Committee's continued inaction on the promised congressional release of
the $362 million appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund in
FY 1998. As requested by Congress, the Administration has submitted a 1
ist of proposed land acquisitions.  In response, the Committee has not
only held back the FY 1998 Title V funding but, also has funded some items
on the Administration's list with FY 1999 funding, resulting in critical
acquisitions planned for both years being delayed and unfunded.

        Millennium Program. The Administration strongly urges the House to
proviqe funding in FY 1999 for the "Millennium Program to Save America's
Treasures." The Committee has failed to provide any funding for this


important effort. The President's budget requests $50 million to increase
the Historic Preservation Fund to make a special effort to preserve our
history and culture as we enter the new millennium. This program is
designed to leverage Federal, State, and private funding to have the
greatest collective impact on our rapidly deteriorating national
treasures.

        Purchaser Road Credit Program. The Administration fully supports the
Committee's decision to eliminate the Purchaser Road credit program. The
Committee bill includes a provision that would ensure that the value of
road construction by purchasers continues to be included in calculations
for the Payments to States.  To permit increased certainty and better
local planning more directly, we urge the House to adopt the
Administration's proposal to provide a high, fixed level of payments to
States.

        Timber Sales. The Administration objects to the increase of $12 million
over the request for timber sales in order to produce 3.6 billion board
feet, 200 million board feet over the budget estimate.

Language Provisions

         The Administration strongly objects to certain language in the
Committee bill, including provisions that would:

 unwisely terminate the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management
Project in six Northwest States, forcing individual amendments to 74 land
management plans;

 remove 75 acres in Florida from the coastal barrier protection system,
providing taxpayer subsidies for private development of environmentally
fragile barrier islands;

 prevent the BIA and the Indian Health Service from entering into any new
or expanded self-determination "Section 638" contracts or self-governance
compacts with tribes, contrary to our government-to-government policy;

 prohibit improvements -- even planning or design of improvements -- to
Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House;

 transfer the jurisdiction over the valued Land Between The Lakes National
Recreation Area from the Tennessee Valley Authority, where it has been
successfully managed for over sixty years, to the U.S. Forest Service, a
disruptive change that would involve additional transition costs without
improving service; and,

 impose an excessive, strictly defined, road easement across the Chugach
National Forest in Alaska, thereby preventing the Government from making
modifications to protect the environment while authorizing environmentally
damaging management practices and undermining an ongoing discussion to
determine the most appropriate road corridor based on a 1982 agreement.

Indian Health Service (Department of Health and Human Services)

        The Administration is concerned that the Committee has not
included a $10 million increase requested for prevention and treatment of
alcohol/substance abuse and breast/cervical cancer, which is part of an
HHS-wide effort to reduce health disparities in minority populations. The
Administration intends to work with the Congress to fund these important
initiatives within funds available for the Indian Health Service. The


Administration is also concerned that the Committee has included
authorizing language, without hearings or tribal consultation, that would
require contract support costs to be distributed to tribes and tribal
organizations on a pro-rata (proportional) basis.

Department of Energy

         The Administration strongly objects to the House's severe
reduction to the Department of Energy's Energy Conservation program.
While the Committee mark appears to be $18 million higher than the FY 1998
enacted level ($630 million vs. $612 million), it includes $43 million for
a program that previously has been funded in the Fossil Energy R&D
account.   The House's funding for the programs traditionally included in
the Energy Conservation Account is $587 million, a cut of $25 million from
the FY 1998 level and a reduction of $222 million from the President's
request of $809 million. Within this reduction, particularly severe
damage is done to the Partnership for a New Generation of vehicles (PNGV),
for which the Committee mark is $14 million (roughly 10 percent) less than
the current appropriation and $45 million below the request.

        These cuts would eliminate all of the Administration's requested
increase in Energy Conservation for development of technologies to improve
industrial, transportation, and building efficiencies and to reduce carbon
emissions. The inclusion of several special-interest earmarks in the
Committee Report also would reduce the President's ability to gain maximum
benefit from the available funds.  The inclusion of the $43 million in the
Energy Conservation account to fund a utility-scale turbine program that
would continue to be managed by the Fossil Energy program is an
inefficient management practice that would dilute accountability and
should be avoided.

        The Committee mark eliminates all of the funding requested for the
Energy Information Administration to work on carbon emissions accounting
and analysis ($2.5 million), and eliminates all of the requested increase
in Fossil Energy R&D for high-priority carbon sequestration research ($10
million). The President's budget also requested $36 million for payment
to the State of California for the Retired Teachers System, which is not
included in the Committee mark.  The Administration prefers that this
payment be appropriated consistent with P.L. 104-106.

        The Administration would like to work with the Congress to restore
funding to these important Department of Energy programs as the bill moves
through the process.

National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities

        The Administration appreciates the Full Committee's restoration of
funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).  The Administration
strongly objects to striking NEA funding and strongly supports the
amendment to restore such funding.  We urge the House to provide funding
for NEA and NEH at the President's requested level of $136 million each
and for the Institute for Museum and Library Services at the requested
level of $26 million.

Smithsonian Institution

        The Committee's $397 million overall funding level for the
Smithsonian, which is $22 million less than the Administration's request,
would prevent the Institution from addressing current pressing needs.  The
Administration is concerned with the lack of support for the Smithsonian's


National Museum of the American Indian. The Administration encourages the
Committee to provide the $16 million request for the construction of the
Museum on the Mall, as well as the full $11 million requested for the
programs and operations of the Cultural Resources Center.  In addition,
the Administration urges that the $3 million request for digitization of
Smithsonian exhibits be restored.

John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts

        The Administration urges the House to provide the full $33 million
requested for the Kennedy Center.  In particular, we ask that the
Committee provide the full construction request of $20 million, which is
also included in the Administration's pending authorization bill.

Holocaust Museum

        The Administration urges the House to provide the full $32.6
million requested for the Holocaust Museum.

Infringement on Executive Authority

        There are several provisions in the Committee bill that purport to
require congressional approval before Executive Branch execution of
aspects of the bill. The Administration will interpret such provisions to
require notification only, since any other interpretation would contradict
the Supreme Court ruling in INS vs. Chadha.
