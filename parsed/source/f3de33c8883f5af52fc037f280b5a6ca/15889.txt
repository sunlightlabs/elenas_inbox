             MEMORANDUM FOR                  THE PRESIDENT

             FROM:                           Gene Sperling
                                             Bruce Lindsey

             SUBJECT:                        Product liability legislation

             I. ACTION FORCING EVENT: On May 1, on a strict party line vote, the Senate Commerce
             Committee reported out S.648, Senator Gorton's revision of the product liability bill you vetoed
             last year. Senator Rockefeller not only voted against S.648, but has made it very clear that he
             will not join until your concerns are satisfied, and Senator Gorton understands that without
             Senator Rockefeller's support, the bill cannot pass. On the other hand, Senator Lott has been
             pushing to bring the bill to the floor, leading Senator Rockefeller (together with Mr. Dingell) to
             press us to negotiate changes in the bill to meet your concern. They have suggested that if we
             are not ready to negotiate "soon," they will attempt to make the changes themselves, with no
             guarantee that you will, in fact, be satisfied. We believe Senator Lott can be held off until after
             the July 4 recess, but not much longer. Meanwhile, Senator Breaux is urging us to work with
             him on an alternative to the Gorton bill.

             II. BACKGROUND: The 104th Congress passed product liability reform law -- a part of the
             Contract with America -- by a vote of259 to 158 in the House and 59 to 40 in the Senate. On
             May 2, 1996, you vetoed the bill, citing eight issues:

                     Interference with state prerogatives in tort law
                     One-way preemption, where pro-consumer state laws were preempted, but laws that
                      limited consumer rights were not
                     The cap on punitive damages, particularly in light of the Statement of Managers, which
                      virtually directed judges not to use the "additur" provision included in the bill under
                      which caps could be superseded
                     Several -- not joint -- liability for non-economic damages
                     A too-short (15 years), too-broad (all products) statute of repose
                     Preemption of state negligent entrustment statutes, which make sellers of dangerous
                      goods (e.g., firearms and liquor) responsible for certain actions of the buyers
                     Failure to toll the statute oflimitations during the period of a stay issued by a bankruptcy
                      court
                     Application of the limits on liability of biomedical materials suppliers to negligent
                      suppliers



                                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                         ESDraft:March 19,2010 (9:22AM)

    The House failed to override your veto by a vote of258 to 163 to override. The House having
    failed to override, the Senate never took a vote.

    S.648 fixes the bankruptcy tolling problem, and makes an honest -- although not complete --
    attempt to respond to the negligent entrustment issue. Moreover, it lengthens the statute of
    repose to 18 years, and establishes two-way preemption in that case, so that shorter state statutes
    (and all state statutes that are set in years are shorter) would be lengthened. However, the bill
    does not respond to the two major problems you cited -- the cap on punitives and several liability
    for non-economic damages -- nor does it change the biomedical materials provision.

    Senator Rockefeller is clearly looking for guidance on how to resolve the punitives and
    non-economic damages issues to meet both the concerns and fact patterns in your veto message.
    However, he expects that once these issues are resolved, you will support the bill. Senator
    Breaux, on the other hand, would like to deal with this issue in an entirely different way, with a
    bill focused far more on reducing frivolous lawsuits and encouraging alternative dispute
    resolution. He would include a statute of repose that is more flexible than that in S.648, would
    establish uniform federal standards for punitives damages but no cap, and would no nothing to
    change state law concerning joint and several liability for non-economic damages. 1 It is unclear
    how far Senator Breaux can get in moving support off the Gorton bill without the
    Administration's support for his approach. Consumer groups and others are strongly opposed to
    any legislation in this area, and have stated they view you as "the last bastion against tort
    deform."

    Over the past six weeks, we have jointly run an interagency process to consider whether there
    might be ways to alter S.648 to respond to the concerns in your veto message in a manner that
    could be potentially acceptable to at least Democratic proponents of the legislation. Participants
    in the process included: OVP, NEC, DPC, OMB, CEA, White House Counsel, White House
    Legislative Affairs, Justice, Treasury, Commerce, and SBA and the Consumer Product Safety
    Commission. as an advisor. FDA is participating in the discussion of biomedical materials.




           1 As discussed below, many states, including California, already have several liability for
    non-economic damages.


                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                    -3-              ESDraft:March 19, 20lO (9:22AM)

  We have surveyed the law in all the states on the critical issues of punitive damages, joint and
  several liability and statute of repose, and have developed a number of alternatives in each area
  that we believe move the bill closer (and in some cases, all the way) to your goals but may have a
  chance of not being rejected out of hand by proponents. 2 These issues, our analysis, our
  proposals, and our recommendations are discussed individually below. 3 In general, we have
  requested guidance on a preferred proposal, and also on the extent to which we can negotiate.
  Our intention would be to try to negotiate first with Senator Rockefeller, but if that is a total
  failure within the parameters you layout, we would open discussions with Senator Breaux.

  While you did not ask us to go back to first principles and look at the Gorton bill as a whole -- in
  contrast to focusing on the items cited in the veto statement -- we think it important that you be
  aware that other portions of the bill may pose potential difficulty. In particular:
      In an attempt to preempt only portions of state law and procedure, it is possible the bill
         oversteps constitutional bounds with respect to federalism. We have asked OLC to
         consider this issue, but they will not render an opinion until they have had a chance to
         analyze the Supreme Court's upcoming opinion in the Brady bill case, which raises some
         of these same federalism issues.
      The bill's preemption language, which is meant to leave state law in place except where
         explicitly preempted, is unclear and needs to be revised. DOJ will develop language to
         deal with this, which we will offer the sponsors.
      The bill's treatment of "misuse or alteration" would in essence relieve a manufacturer or
         seller of responsibility for injury caused by foreseeable misuse of a product, such as using
         flammable cotton playwear for as sleepwear for children. The Consumer Product Safety
         Act makes provision for this eventuality. [We have had one discussion about how to deal
         with this issue, but have not yet reached an agreement.]

  III. MAJOR ISSUES PRESENTED:

  A. Joint and several liability for non-economic damages

  Over the last several years, tort refonn at the state level has essentially done away with the
  traditional rule of no comparative fault and full joint and several liability. (Only Alabama,
  Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia retain this combination.) Nine states4 have full joint and


          2  Based on discussions with the Center for Violence Policy, we have also crafted a more complete
  fix to the negligent entrustment provision. We believe there will be no problem getting the proponents to
  adopt this.

          3 A sub-group consisting of DOJ, CPSC and FDA is working on the biomedical materials issue.
  They will report back within two weeks.             .

          4 Arkansas, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
  Carolina and West Virginia


                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                         - 4-            ESDraft:March 19, 20lO (9:22AM)

        several liability, but include comparative fault, thereby reducing the defendants' joint
        responsibility by the measure of the plaintiffs responsibility. Thirteen states5 have pure several
        liability, for both economic and non-economic damages. 24 states have various hybrid forms,
        which are described in the attached Department of Justice memo. Note particularly that in
        California, defendants are only severally liable for non-economic damages.

        Both last year's vetoed bill and S.648 limit a defendant's responsibility for non-economic
        damages "in direct proportion to the percentage of responsibility of the defendant for the harm to
        the claimant." The trier of fact is required to assign this percentage taking into account the
        responsibility of all persons responsible, including those not before the court, such as settling
        defendants. While the preemption is two-way, since the provision is less plaintiff-friendly than
        virtually any other formulation, two-way preemption is largely irrelevant.

        In vetoing last year's bill with respect to this issue, you cited the provision's general effect of
        preventing "many persons from receiving full compensation for injury," noting in particular the
        problems created by insolvent defendants. You also cited the particular impact of a several rule
        for non-economic damages as unfairly discriminating against "the most vulnerable members of
        our society." You said, "Noneconomic damages are as real and as important to victims as
        economic damages."

        The formulations described below reduce the negative impact of imposing several liability for
        non-economic damages. However, any formulation that does not guarantee the plaintiff 100%
        of non-economic damages (where there is any solvent and available defendant) is discriminatory
        against non-economic damages in those states that retain joint liability for economic damages.
        Assuming you do not want to put several liability for economic damages into play, you should be
        aware that all of the options described -- except pure reallocation -- have this flaw.

        Informed by various state law provisions concerning joint and several liability, your advisors
        considered formulations for federal preemption involving the following concepts:
             Several liability with reallocation among remaining defendants (and plaintiff if the
               plaintiff is at fault) in the event the amount allocated to any defendant is uncollectible
               (thus guaranteeing plaintiffs lOO% recovery for the portion of the damage not their fault,
               but sparing low-fault, deep-pocket defendants the need to sue for contribution)
             Setting a level offault below which only several liability will apply (thus responding to
               the concerns oflow-fault deep-pocket defendants)
             Setting a threshold of fault below which several liability will apply, but with a multiplier
               (thereby guaranteeing the plaintiff some recovery where only the low-fault defendants are
               solvent)
             Guaranteeing the plaintiff a specified percentage of recovery of non-economic damages


              5 Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, North Dakota, Tennessee, Utah,
        Vermont and Wyoming


                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                                     HeX-Dump Conversion

       The extent to which plaintiff fault will be taken into account to reduce recovery for
        non-economic damages
       Special rules for small businesses, particularly as to responsibility for more than their
        share of damages
       Two-way preemption, which would be meaningful if federal law were less pro-plaintiff
        than some state laws

Working on the assumption that you wished us to develop proposals that include several liability
for non-economic damages -- so as to be able to convince those favoring product liability of our
good faith, but that are least restrictive of the rights of plaintiffs, your advisors developed the
following alternative formulations relating only to non-economic damages:

    Proposal! - ReaUocation6              .
     Joint and several if the plaintiff is fault-free
     If the plaintiff is at all at fault, liability is several, but if the plaintiff cannot collect from
       one or more defendant after a specified period oftime7, the plaintiff can petition the court
       for reallocation of damages not attributable to the plaintiff among the remaining
       defendants, but no defendant less at fault than the plaintiff may be charged with more
       than twice his proportionate share of damages
     This would be two-way preemptive
    Pros
     Preserves balance between faultless plaintiff and defendant with any fault in favor of the
       plaintiff
     Is generally consistent -- or at least not less pro-plaintiff -- with the laws of most states8
     Where plaintiff is at fault, less culpable defendants -- even if they are deep pockets -- will
       have their damages limited
     Of all the potential limitations, is most likely to retain 100% recovery for non-economic
       damages
     By retaining joint and several liability in many situations, should encourage settlement
    Cons
     May be viewed as excessively pro-plaintiff, and thus not a good-faith offer, particularly if
       it is two-way, thus increasing defendants' responsibility in states, such as California, with
       several liability for non-economic damages

        6   This is based on the statute currently in effect in Missouri.

         7 In Missouri it is 30 days, which may be too short to actually encourage the plaintiff to try to
collect; in Connecticut it is one year, which may be too long.

        8   Only plaintiffs with some degree of fault in the four states that retain traditional no comparative
fault/joint and several liability would be significantly disadvantaged; plaintiffs in the nine states with
comparative fault and joint and several liability could be somewhat disadvantaged. Plaintiffs in states
with any further restrictions would likely benefit.

        May limit plaintiffs recovery where plaintiff is at fault and there are multiple defendants
        Requires fact-finders in (the 13) states that currently do not have comparative fault or
         several liability to assign degrees of responsibility
        Shifts from defendants to plaintiffs the responsibility for collecting from each defendant,
         potentially adding to delay in recovering and increased expense
        As among defendants, it is unclear why the extent of the plaintiff's responsibility should
         have an impact on defendants' responsibility to pay the judgment

     Proposal2A - Guaranteed recovery, two-way preemption
      Joint and several liability of any defendant is than 30% at fault (taking into account the
        fault of the plaintiff and settling defendants)
      If any defendant is less than 30% at fault, that defendant's responsibility would be limited
        to a maximum of twice the defendant's proportionate share of non-economic damages
        except where a greater multiplier was needed to ensure the plaintiff recovery of at least
        50% of the assessed non-economic damages.

     Proposal2B - Guaranteed. recovery, one-way preemption
      Joint and several liability of any defendant is than 10% at fault (taking into account the
        fault of the plaintiff and settling defendants)
      If any defendant is less than 10% at fault, that defendant's responsibility would be limited
        to a maximum of twice the defendant's proportionate share of non-economic damages
        except where a greater multiplier was needed to ensure the plaintiff recovery of at least
        60% of the assessed non-economic damages.
     Pros
      Should be seen by proponents oflimitation as a good-faith offer, with real limits
      Preserves joint and several liability for defendants with significant degree of fault
      Ensures that no low-fault defendant will have to pay more than 50% (or 60%, if one-way)
        oftotal non-economic damages, and that in most cases they will be limited to their
        proportionate share
      Although it limits responsibility oflow-fault defendants, it guarantees that plaintiff will
        collect substantial portion of assessed non-economic damages (if there are any solvent
        and available defendants)
      The two-way preemption version would increase plaintiff s guaranteed level of recovery
        in states with several liability for non-economic damages (such as California and Illinois),
        and thus might be considered an acceptable tradeoff for limitation on guaranteed recovery
        in other states
     Cons
      Setting the guaranteed recovery level at 50% or 60% (or, in fact, any level lower than
        100%) maybe viewed as non-responsive to both the objections in the veto statement--
        not full recovery, and discrimination against non-economic damages
      Will require fact-finders in the 13 states that don't have both comparative negligence and
        several liability to make additional determinations

              Defendants who view themselves as likely to be low-fault deep pockets will object that
               their potential for payment of non-economic damages is so high that they cannot take
               limitations into account in either settlement discussions or purchase of insurance
              Small degrees of differentiation of fault -- e.g., between 9%. and 11 % -- could have major
               repercussions on responsibility to pay damages

       Your advisors recommend that proposal 1 be the first one we explore with proponents of product
       liability. It is by far the most consistent with the veto statement. If, however, it is rejected out
       of hand by product liability proponents, and you believe it is essential that we continue to
       negotiate, we would recommend Proposal2A, which includes two-way preemption. We should
       make it very clear that if forced to one-way preemption, we would only accept a proposal with a
       significantly higher level of guaranteed recovery for the plaintiff (e.g., 60%), and a significantly
       lower threshold of for imposition of several liability (e.g., 10%).

       Areas where we believe some negotiation could be possible include:
           Some decrease in the minimum level of recovery for two-way preemption (we would
              put an absolute floor at 50% for one-way preemption and 40% for two-way preemption)
           Some increase in the threshold for imposition of joint and several liability (we would put
              an absolute ceiling of 35% for two-way preemption and 15% for one-way preemption)
           Establishment of a limit on the liability of very small businesses (e.g., those with fewer
              than 10 employees) for amounts over their proportionate share of damages (we would
              suggest a limit of at least $200,000). Your advisors do not recommend this option.

                  Offer proposal 1 only; come back for further instructions if that is rejected

                  Offer proposal 1, but be prepared to move to proposal 2A if necessary, with leeway to
                  agree to a 40% minimum recovery level and a 35% threshold; come back for further
                  instructions if this is insufficient; do not negotiate anyone-way preemption or any
                  small business limitation

                  Offer proposal 1, being prepared to move to proposal 2A and then 2B if necessary,

      The process of awarding punitive damages and the amount of such damages have been the
      subject of some of the most intense controversy, with manufacturers asserting that unpredictable

  and unjustifiably large punitive damage awards have driven them out of markets and impinged
  on innovations, and consumer advocates asserting that only potentially unlimited punitive
  damages can deter hannful misconduct. Surveys suggest that neither the award of punitives nor
  the amount is skyrocketing in products cases. 9




           9 A soon-to-be-released Rand study has found an increase in the number and amount of punitive
  damage awards in financial fraud cases, such as cases involving insurance or financial products
  misrepresentation. This does not appear to extend to cases involving products as defined in the bill, which
  is limited to physical goods.

      Both last year's vetoed bill and S.648 cap punitive damages -- at the greater of two times
      compensatories (including non-economic damages) or $250,000 for most companies and the
      lesser of these two amounts for individuals and small businesses. Upon consideration of a list
      of eight factors lO, a judge could award damages in excess ofthe large business cap (but not the
      small business cap), up to the amount awarded by the jury, which would not be informed of the
      cap. 11 The "additur" provision explicitly constitutes one-way preemption -- it does not permit
      additur where state law otherwise limits punitive damages.

      The bills would also: (i) establish a uniform federal standard of proof of "clear and convincing";
      (ii) establish a uniform standard for award that conduct "carried out with conscious, flagrant
      indifference to the rights or safety of others was the proximate cause" of the harm; and (iii)
      authorize any party to request that punitive damages be considered in a separate proceeding
      (generally so that evidence of the defendant's financial condition would not be allowed into
      evidence during the liability and compensatory damages phase of the trial). It appears these
      standards and procedural rules are meant to constitute two-way preemption, except that they
      would not permit punitive damages in states where such damages are not allowed.

      In vetoing last year's bill, you stated that you "oppose arbitrary ceilings on punitive damages,
      because they endanger the safety of the public. Capping punitive damages undermines their very
      purpose, which is to punish and thereby deter egregious misconduct." You noted that the
      additur provision might have mitigated this concern, but the Statement of Managers virtually
      directing it not be used made it ineffective in that respect.




               10 The factors are: "(i) the extent to which the defendant acted with actual malice; (ii) the
      likelihood that serious harm would arise from the conduct of the defendant; (iii) the degree of the
      awareness of the defendant of that likelihood; (iv) the profitability of the misconduct to the defendant; (v)
      the duration of the misconduct and any concurrent or subsequent concealment of the conduct by the
      defendant; (vi) the attitude and conduct of the defendant upon the discovery of the misconduct and
      whether the misconduct has terminated; (vii) the fmancial condition of the defendant; (viii) the cumulative
      deterrent effect of other losses, damages, and punishment suffered by the defendant as a result of the
      misconduct, reducing the amount of punitive damages on the basis of the economic impact and severity of
      all measures to which the defendant has been or may be subjected ... "

               11 The judge would be required to hold a separate proceeding on awarding an additional amount,
      consider each of the items, and state the court's reasons for an award above the cap in findings of fact and
      conclusions of law. A separate finding on each factor is not explicitly required. The conference report
      on last year's bill, of course, virtually directed judges not to use this authority.

                                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

In considering alternative responses to the issue raised by the punitive damages cap, your
advisors considered the present state of state law and likely trends. In seven states punitive
damages are generally forbidden; in 16 others, they are capped in one way or another.
Twenty-seven states allow unlimited punitive damages in product liability cases. Most states
that allow punitive damages have adopted the "clear and convincing" evidentiary standard. While
the liability standards are less uniform, only a few states 12 allow the award of punitive damages
for reckless behavior without some other aggravating factor. We have not found any state that
requires that the conduct leading to the punitive damages be the "proximate cause" of the
plaintiff's harm, although the words "cause" and "result" are used. Bifurcated trials -- at least
on the.issue of the defendant's financial condition -- are allowed or required in 15 states.

The factors your advisors considered in developing alternatives were:
    Maintaining the quasi-criminal role of punitive damages to punish and deter egregious
        conduct
    Whether there are ways to reduce the perception that such damages are awarded
        capriciously and without uniform standards
    How to reduce the ''windfall'' nature of the award of punitives while retaining an
      . incentive for plaintiffs to press for punitives in appropriate cases
    Whether a limitation on punitive damages payable by small businesses is appropriate,
        even if a broader cap is not, and if so, how it should be structured
    The effect of provisions allowing judges to override caps
    Whether preemption should be one-way or two-way

Your advisors have developed four alternatives.

   Proposall - Procedural changes, coupled with a breach able cap for small businesses
    Support the provisions in S.648 providing for uniform federal standards of clear and
      convincing evidence and the right to request bifurcation.
    Support a uniform federal liability standard for punitive damages that would not include
      recklessness, but (i) would not require that the conduct that is the subject of the punitive
      damages is the "proximate cause" of the plaintiff's harm and (ii) would explicitly permit
      circumstantial evidence of intent or malice.
    Cap punitive damages at the lesser of twice compensatories or $250,000 for firms that
      have 10 or fewer employees and annual revenues of $1 million or less. The jury would
      not be told of the cap, and the judge could award damages in excess of the cap (but only
      up to the amount awarded by the jury) upon a finding that the capped amount was
      "insufficient to punish or deter."
    This would be two-way preemption, except that it would not require states that currently
      do not allow punitive damages in products cases to allow such awards

      By providing procedural uniformity, some of the concern about capriciousness in the
       award of punitive damages might be mitigated
     Consistent with both the law of most states and S.648 or earlier versions of products
       liability legislation
     Provides some protection for truly small businesses, responding to one ofthe complaints
       about the capriciousness of punitives
     Since businesses of the size described are rarely hit with significant punitive damages,
       since in most states the defendant's financial condition is already taken into
       consideration, there may be little practical negative effect.
     Unlikely to meet with serious opposition from any quarter (except those who favor no
       legislation at all)
     Allows the Administration to agree with some sort of cap
    Cons
     Agreeing to any cap at all breaks through a clear line we established last year of "no caps
       on punitives"; it may be very difficult to hold the line against expansion of this cap, either
       to larger businesses, or by limiting the judge's discretion
     Will almost certainly not be sufficient to respond to large manufacturer concerns that
       have led to the demand for a cap on punitives, and thus may not be considered a good
       faith offer
     Federal direction of state court procedure may be more constitutionally vulnerable than
       imposition of federal rights and responsibilities. 13

    Proposal 2 - Allocation of punitive damages between plaintiff and state
     Authorize the jury to impose punitive damages without any cap on large businesses; small
       business punitives would be capped as in Proposal 1
     Vest the plaintiff in a 25% share of the total punitive damages, which amount will be
       assumed to include attorney's fees (i.e., no additional attorney's fees will be payable out
       of the punitive award)
     The remainder ofthe award would be payable to the state whose substantive law applies
       to the determination of punitive damages.
     States would be forbidden to intervene in the proceedings at any stage.
     Combine this with the procedural reforms outlined in Proposal 1
     This would be two-way preemptive except (i) it would not require states that do not allow
       punitive damages in products cases to allow such awards and (ii) states would explicitly
       be allowed to opt out of the allocation to the state, in which case prior state law with
       respect to caps and allocation would apply

   Maintains the punitive and deterrent effect of punitive damages, enhancing their analogy
   to civil fines pursued by "private attorneys general"
 Gets rid of the windfall nature of punitive damages in excess ofthe plaintiffs share, but
   the share should still be high enough to encourage plaintiffs to pursue punitives in
   appropriate cases
 Provides some limit on damages for small businesses
 Depending on state decisions of how to allocate funds, may make additional money
   available (although only on an intermittent and unpredictable basis) for civil access by
   indigents or consumer protection efforts
 Because damages available to individual plaintiffs (and contingent lawyer's fees) are
   more restricted than the risk to the defendant, may encourage settlement
 Disallowing state intervention keeps transaction costs down and prevents situation in
   which state might want to discourage settlement because of the possibility of receiving
   punitive damages
 Protects the interest some states may have in not wanting to encourage award of punitive
   damages
Cons
 Would break through last year's clear line. concerning caps
 Does not respond to large manufacturers' complaint about the risk of having to pay
   excessive damages, as the total amount is uncapped, and thus may not be seen as a good
   faith offer
 May have perverse effects if judges refuse remittitur or juries increase awards because
   part of the money is "going to a good cause"
 Needs to be carefully drafted to avoid constitutional "takings" problems; several state
   statutes providing that a portion of the award goes to the state have been struck down on
   this basis
 There may be no political constituency for this, as plaintiffs' awards will be reduced and
   defendants' awards (except for small businesses) will not be limited

Proposal 3 - Advisory jury opinion with judicial determination
 The jury would render a solely advisory opinion on punitive damages
 The actual determination of punitive damages would be made by the judge
 The judge would be required to consider the factors in S.648, and would be required to
   explain why the judge's award differs (either higher or lower) from the jury's advice
 Combine with procedural changes from proposal 1
Pros
 The lack of a cap is consistent with your prior position
 In analogous to criminal law, by keeping the jury involved, but placing the decision on
   what is essentially a punishment in the hands of the person most experienced in deciding
   such issues, the judge
 Since historically, punitive damage awards that seem unjustified have stemmed from jury
   decisions, may increase rationality in the system

                                                                      '. "'-"'M! "'''cords Management System

      By adopting the S.648 factors, may be seen as a good faith offer, although it does not
       include a cap                               .
    Cons
     Takes away from the jury what has been regarded as a traditional jury function
     While judges may determine punitive damages in many states in cases where they are the
       trier of fact, only Connecticut and Kansas provide for initial judicial determination (in
       contrast to appellate review or remittitur) where a jury has sat
     Unlikely to solve concems of either proponents or opponents of caps
     May raise difficult Seventh Amendment issues ("no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise
       reexamined in any court of the United States than according to the rules of common law")

   Proposal 4 - Cap with easier breakthrough
    Cap punitive damages at the greater of $250,000 or twice compensatories (the lesser of
      the two for small businesses)
    Do not tell the jury of the cap
    Allow the judge to award punitive damages above the cap (for both small and large
      businesses) without an additional proceeding and on a simple finding that the capped
      amount is "insufficient to punish or deter," the standard in S.648, with no consideration
      of specified factors
    Insist that there be no legislative history suggesting this authority is to be used any more
      sparingly than implied by the statutory standard
    Couple this with the procedural changes described in proposal 1
    This would be two-way preemptive, except with respect to states that do not allow
      punitives in products cases at all
   Pros
    Closest to both S.648 and earlier versions of bill, and thus likely to be most easily
      regarded as acceptable by proponents
    Particularly given that there are few punitive damage awards in excess of the cap and that
      judges now have remittitur authority, this would likely have little practical impact on
      actual awards
    The procedural changes may produce more uniformity across the country
    Making the additur provision two-way preemptive is a real improvement for plaintiffs
      compared to S.648
   Cons
    This looks like a cap on punitive damages, which you said you opposed; "no caps on
      punitives" has been used as a shorthand description of the Administration's firmest
      position
    It may actually be a cap with judges reluctant to award punitives
    Holding the line on the legislative history can be very difficult, particularly if the statute
      is acceptable in all other respects

Your advisors recommend proposal 1 be the first one we explore with proponents of the
legislation. While proposal 2 responds to the part of the issue where defendants have the most


                                                                         Aulomatad Recorcls Management System

sympathetic case -- the windfall to plaintiffs and their attorneys -- and your advisors favor it as
good public policy, it is complex and injects serious new issues into the discussion. On the
other hand, we believe it is superior to the remaining two alternatives, and would suggest putting
it on the table if proposal 1 is rejected. By moving beyond the concept of caps, proposal 2 may
generate more serious discussion about what the issues really are and how to resolve them.
Proposal 3 might be an easy compromise if people really want to move away from capping
punitives, but want some protection against juries run wild. We would only put proposal 4 on
the table as an absolute fall-back, although we realize there is a further fall-back: putting some of
the factors back into the statute, although simply as things to consider.

At its starkest, a statute of repose bars litigation after a product has been in service a specified
period of time. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia currently have statutes of reposed
for product liability; 17 of the states and the District restrict lawsuits after a specified number of
years (ranging from 5 to 15) and the remainder use some variation of "useful life" as the bar. In
1994, you signed legislation establishing a preemptive 18-year statute of repose for general
aviation.

The bill you vetoed last year included a preemptive IS-year statute of repose for all products.
The statute would, however, only have preempted states without any statute of repose, or with a
statute longer than 15 years. Shorter state statutes would have remained effective. Your veto
message referenced the length of the statute, the fact that it was broadly inclusive (you cited
handguns), and the fact that the preemption was only one way. The Senate bill from the I04th
Congress had covered only durable goods in the workplace and had an 18-year one-way
preemptive statute.

        S. 648, as reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee on a voice vote, includes a fully
        (two-way) preemptive 18-year statute of repose, covering all products except: (i) motor vehicles,
        vessels, aircraft and trains used to transport passengers for hire; (ii) products that cause toxic
        harm; and (iii) products with express written warranties that exceed 18 years.

        Your advisors considered several alternative formulations of statutes of repose, with the main
        variables being:
             Whether any statute of repose would be "two way," lengthening shorter statutes as well as
                imposing or shortening longer ones
             Whether there should be a bright line -- such as a number of years -- or a standard more
                linked to specific types of products -- such as ''useful safe life"
             Whether any bright line would be rebuttable, and if so by what standard of proof
             The breadth of coverage, for example, all consumer products or only durable goods in the
                workplace
             Whether there should be exceptions, such as for toxic substances
             The relationship between the statute of repose and the statute of limitations

        Working from the current version of S.648 and your veto message, we recommend the following
        formulation:
            Two-way preemption of state law (as in S.648)
            18 year statute of repose (as in S.648)
            Which a plaintiff may overcome by clear and convincing evidence that the product had a
               longer useful safe life (not included in S.648, and responsive to the victim of the
               hay-baler accident cited in the veto message and to accidents involving products clearly
               intended to be longer-lived, such as elevators and most firearms)
            Covering only durable goods in the workplace (narrower than S.648, retaining plaintiff
               rights concerning consumer goods in states without any statute of repose and responding
               to your concern about handguns)
            With further exceptions for toxic substances, vehicles used in transportation for hire, and
               express warranties (as in S.648)
            And with a provision that extends the statute to allow full benefit of the two-year statute
               of limitations after injury or discovery of harm in, for example, year 17 (not in S.648, but
               not expected to be a problem)

        Arguments for and against this formulation are:
          Pros
           By building on S.648, demonstrates good faith to proponents of that legislation
           Two-way preemption is responsive to principles of veto message, and also lengthens
             statute in the 22 states that have them
           Number of years is longer than in any current state statute
           Rebuttable presumption protects workers injured by products clearly intended to be
             longer-lived

           Bright line number of years, combined with clear and convincing standard, means
            manufacturers will be free from arguments about whether something was intended to
            have a useful life slightly longer than 18 years
           By restricting statute to durable goods in the workplace, consumers in states without
            statutes of repose retain their access to court for injuries from long-lived or
            intermittently-used consumer goods such as cedar chests and camping and baby products
           Until late last year, all formulations of this statute had been limited to durable goods in
            the workplace, in part because those injured in such accident will at least have received
            some compensation through workers compensation
           Expands on an already-existing federal liability scheme -- workers compensation
           Exceptions protect access to court in latent defect cases

       Cons
        Opponents of product liability reform will oppose any statute of repose as limiting
          plaintiffs' rights in states without such statutes
        Combination of two-way preemption and bright line (even with rebuttable presumption
          and limitation only to durable goods in the workplace), will restrict the access of some
          injured parties to court
        Proponents of S.648 may regard rebuttable presumption and limitation to durable goods
          in the workplace as unacceptable limitations, particularly given that they extended the
          statute from 15 to 18 years and made preemption two-way in response to the veto
          message

    Although we believe the formulation proposed is both fair to plaintiffs and responsive to
    manufacturers, we suggest the following as room for negotiation, and request your authorization
    to allow negotiations within this framework:
         Reduction in time to not less than 15 years, if all other elements remain as in our proposal
         Expansion to consumer goods other than firearms, coupled with (i) a longer period of
            time and (ii) reduction in the burden of proof on ''useful safe life" to "preponderance of
            the evidence"
         One-way preemption, as long as it does not affect any state with no statute of repose
            (which is consistent with our intention not to require states that do not currently allow
            punitive damages to authorize them)

       Decision - Statute of Repose

               Offer proposal as recommended above, with authorization to negotiate within
               parameters recommended

               No negotiation permitted; come back to me with any and all counter-offers

               I do not like this proposal. Let's discuss

    IV. DECISIONS:

               Go ahead with negotiations with Senator Rockefeller, based on the decisions above.
               Be prepared to trade among the three issues, with proposal 1 on joint and several the
               most important thing to try to get. Do not indicate our support for the bill as a whole
               until we've reviewed the entire package together.

               I don't really think there is any way to square our differences with Senator
               Rockefeller. Please inform him of this, and start working with Senator Breaux.

               We need to talk about this.
