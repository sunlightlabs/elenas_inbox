                 DECLINING MINORITY ADMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA

Background: According to figures released by the University of California, minority admissions to
            most University of California institutions have dropped dramatically this year absent
            affirmative action. For example, at the Berkeley campus, minority admissions have
            decreased 57% for black students, 40% for Hispanic students, and 39% for American
            Indian students from last year's rates. At UCLA, minority admissions have
            decreased 43% for black students, 33% for Hispanic students, and 43% for American
            Indian students.

Question:     How do you respond to today's reports that minority admissions to California's
              universities have dropped dramatically?

Answer:       The Administration is extremely concerned about the decline in the numbers of
              African-American, Hispanic, and Native American students admitted to universities
              in California as a result of Proposition 209 and the University of California Board of
              Regents' decision to prohibit the use ofproper!y constructed affirmative action in
              admissions. Educational opportunity is the touchstone of the American dream and
              the key to America's continued strength in the 21st century. At a time when our
              nation is becoming more and more diverse, we must not close the doors of
              educational opportunity to our students of color. Furthermore, because students
              learn from each other as well as from their professors, diversity on campus is a vital
              educational resource that strengthens the educational experience for all our students.
              For these reasons, every American should be concerned about the developments in
              California.

Question:     How do you respond to those who say that the drops in minority admissions only
              indicate the extent to which race was being used to admit underqualified minority
              students?

Answer:       I strongly disagree with that analysis. According to today's Washington Post, the
              University of California at Berkeley had to reject more than 800 minority applicants
              who had perfect 4.0 high school grade point averages and SAT scores of 1200 or
              higher. These minority students are exceptionally qualified for any college or
              university in the country. Furthermore, we as a nation must realize that diversity and
              excellence go hand in hand; they are fully compatible and indeed complementary
              goals. Any educator will tell you that students learn from each other as well in their
              classes and from their professors-- that's why diversity is important.

Question:     What is your administration doing to address this problem?

Answer:       Weare working on several fronts to address this issue:

             We will continue to strongly support proper! y constructed affirmative action
              programs in higher education. For example, we will continue to intervene in
              litigation in support of appropriate affirmative action programs and to challenge the

                                                 1

             Hopwood decision.                               Hex-Dump Conversion

            The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education will continue to
             investigate complaints concerning current admissions policies, including those at
             three University of California law schools, to determine whether they violate federal
             civil rights laws by discriminating against minority students.

            We will continue to press higher education officials to maintain and expand diversity,
             and we will offer assistance to them to do so. For example, we have called on
             colleges and universities burdened by new legal restrictions to develop new and
             creative approaches to achieving diversity, such as aggressively recruiting in
             secondary schools with high percentages of minority students and forming
             educational partnerships with such schools.

            Finally, the President has recently announced a dramatic array of education policy
             actions that will improve educational opportunity and outcomes for all Americans
             and thereby strengthen the pipeline of students progressing from K-12 education to
             college. These initiatives include:

                    High Hopes --a $140 million investment in the FY 1999 budget -- that
                    promotes partnerships between colleges and middle/junior high schools in
                    low-income communities. These partnerships will provide students with
                    vital support services -- including tutoring, counseling, and mentoring and
                    with information on college options, academic requirements, costs, and
                    financial aid to help students stay on track through high school graduation and
                    college.

                    Education Opportunity Zones -- This proposal will devote $1.5 billion over
                    5 years to help high poverty urban and rural school districts help their students
                    reach high standards, by proving resources to strengthen accountability, better
                    train teachers and principals, and provide students who need it with extra help
                    through after school and summer school programs.

                    Small Class with Qualified Teachers -- In order to provide all students with
                    a solid foundation and improve reading in grades 1-3, the Administration is
                    proposing a $12.4 billion initiative over 7 years to help local schools hire
                    100,000 teachers to provide students with small classes and well-prepared
                    teachers.

                    Teacher Preparation and Recruitment -- President Clinton has proposed a
                    $350 million initiative to attract nearly 35,000 outstanding new teachers into
                    high-poverty schools in urban and rural areas over the next five years. In
                    addition, it will upgrade the quality of teacher preparation at institutions of
                    higher education that work in partnership with local schools in inner city and
                    poor rural areas.

Hispanic Education Action Plan -- The Administration's FY99 budget
provides substantial education investments in programs that are targeted to the
needs of Hispanic students, including increases in Bilingual Education,
funding for Hispanic Serving Institutions, TRIO college preparation programs
and migrant education programs.
