                                                                          H~Xo~\llnp ~GlwetSion
RE:              SKILLS SHORTAGES

DATE:            February 27,1998

At Tuesday's (3/3) meeting we plan to continue the discussion of skills shortages. We plan to discuss
both potential long-term solutions as well as potential short-term strategies. In particular, the organization
of the meeting will look something like:

       Highlight current political and economic contexts

                        Growth in demand for workers with IT skills

                        What's happening in health care? Other industries/occupations?

                        Hl-B issue


       Potential short-term solutions that would involve business

                        What are we currently doing in partnership with companies? (DOL, Education,
                         Commerce)

                        What can businesses potentially do?

                                         Better employee outreach/improve partnerships with local
                                                                         colleges (both 2- and 4-year)

                                         More outreach to under-represented groups (minorities, women,
                                          persons with disabilities)

                        What questions do we have for companies?

                                         What is it they need? (What kinds of workers? How highly
                                          skilled? Do they need for them to complete 4-year, 2-year,
                                          6-month programs?)

                                         What sorts of programs might make sense?


       Potential. long-term soI~tions

                        What is the current state of play?
           industries/occupations/regions of the country? (BLS)

          What are we currently doing to inform individuals about "growth"
           industries/occupations/regions of the country?

          What are we currently doing to train individuals for "growth"
           industries/occupations/regions of the country? (DOL, Education,
           Commerce)

   Where should we go from here?

          Better training?

          Better information? (Including should we consider an additional index to
           the BLS employment projections? Should we attempt to improve the
           BLS employment projections?)
