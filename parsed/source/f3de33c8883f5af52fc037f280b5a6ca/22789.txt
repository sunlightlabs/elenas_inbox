                                   President Clinton and Vice President Gore
                               Investing in Smaller Classes and Modern Schools in
                                                           February 19, 1999


         President Clinton is urging Congress to pass his education agenda to reduce class size to a national average of
         18, modernize 6,000 schools nationwide, strengthen accountability and make the needed investments to bring
         our schools into the 21st century,

         Reduced Class Size in the Early Grades
         Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide more personal attention to students and spend less time
         on discipline; this helps students to learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. In his 1998
         State of the Union address, President Clinton proposed to help local school schools hire 100,000 well-prepared
         teachers in order to reduce class size in grades 1-3 to a national average of 18, and make sure that every child
         gets a solid foundation in the basics .. Last year, the President's signed into law the first installment of his seven
         year, $12.4 .billion proposal to hire 100,000 new teachers. For the first year, $1.2 billion was provided to help
         local communities hire about 30,000 teachers. The result:

                   In July,   will receive $ million to hire new teachers for the upcoming school year.

         Now Congress must provide the next installment of$1.4 billion to help hire 38,000 teachers in the second year:

                 Under President's Clinton's proposal, would receive $ million in fiscal year 2000.


         New Classrooms and Modernized Schools
         President Clinton's balanced budget proposes Federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds to
         build and renovate public schools. It is imperative that the Congress act on the Administration proposal to help
         schools provide well-equipped classrooms to accommodate smaller class sizes. Under President Clinton's
         proposal:

               Federal tax credits would be provided to pay the interest on of School Modernization Bonds to build
                and renovate schools in

               Additional Federal tax credits would be provided to pay the interest on of Qualified Zone Academy
                Bonds, which help support innovative public-school and business partnerships.


         Ensuring Accountability
         In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced a package of accountability measures designed
         to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to ensure that school districts and states provide
         students with a high quality education. While insisting that states and local governments retain primary
         responsibility for education, President Clinton called on Congress to make sure federal dollars support what
         works and not what doesn't. His proposal emphasizes reforms that a growing number of states, cities, and
         schools across the nation are implementing and that are producing clear results. Specifically, the President
         announced that he will send to Congress legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act
         to ensure that schools end social promotion; teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned; states
         turn around their lowest-performing schools; parents get annual report cards on school performance; and
