                                    March 8, 1997

Announcement

Today, President Clinton will direct each head of a Federal agency or department to use all
available hiring authorities to hire and retain welfare recipients in jobs in the government.
Specifically, the President would like to expand the use of the Worker-Trainee Program
and other excepted service and competitive hiring processes, and would like agencies to
prepare individualized plans for hiring welfare recipients. Further, the President will ask
agencies to take explore and report on ways to help low-income employees access the
Earned-Income Tax Credit (EITC), transportation subsidies, and affordable child care.

Background

Since the President signed the historic welfare reform law, he has urged businesses,
non-profit organizations, and religious groups across the nation to help make its promise of
opportunity real by offering jobs to welfare recipients.

The hiring power of these groups is great: There are 826,000 U.S. businesses with more than
20 employees; 1.1 million nonprofit organizations (not including congregations); and 205,583
congregations with more than 100 members. Including the Federal government in this effort,
increases the hiring power even more.

By taking this action, the President ensures that the federal government, in its role as
employer, contributes to the greatest extent possible to this national effort.

Welfare Reform Accomplishments

The following statistics highlight Clinton Administration accomplishments on welfare
reform. We are making great progress, but there is more to do.

·      Already, the welfare rolls have dropped by almost 18 percent from the March 1994 peak.
       As of November 1996, there are 2,500,000 fewer people on welfare than the day the
       President took his first oath of office -- the biggest drop in history -- and the rolls
       continued to drop.

·      The poverty rate is down, decreasing by 2.9 million people between 1993 and 1995 after
       four straight years of increases.

·      Over the past four years, the Administration has toughened child support enforcement,
       increasing collections by 50 percent. That's an increase of about $4 billion from $8 billion
       to $12 billion.

·      The teen birth rate declined four years in a row by a total of eight percent between
       1991-1995.

                       Making Work Pay For Low-Income Federal Emn~i!esnp Conversion

The President's directive asks appropriate agencies to take three steps that will assist all
low-income federal employees, whether or not former welfare recipients. Following is an
explanation of the existing government services in these three areas and the rationale for agencies to
expand their use of each.

Notifying Those Eligible About The EITC

The President directs each agency head to notify all employees eligible for the Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) of both their eligibility and their ability to receive EITC monies each month in their
paychecks.

The EITC is available to low-income individuals with incomes up to $25,760 who have at least one
child living with them in a home in the United States. The credit is based on a percentage of the
employee's earned income. An eligible employee can claim the credit on the individual income tax
return at the end of the year or the employee may receive advance payments with her pay.
Payment of the advance EITC is limited to 60 percent of what an eligible employee would receive if
she has only one qualifying child. For 1997, the maximum amount that may be advanced is $1,326.

While agencies are currently encouraged to notity eligible employees about the EITC and the
payment options, not all agencies do so. By directing each agency to notify its eligible employees
about the EITC, the Federal government will ensure that its low-income employees receive the
EITC in the manner that best enables them to cover costs such as child care, transportation, and
housing, without which an employee may not be able to enter or remain in the labor market.

Encouraging Agency Use of the Federal Fare Subsidy Program

The President directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to issue guidelines that address
whether agencies may offer fare subsidies based on the employee's income.

The Federal Fare Subsidy Program is one of several programs Federal agencies have the option to
offer employees as part of the 1993 Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act. As of 1994 (the
most current data available) ten agencies offered direct fare subsidies to over 30,000 employees to
encourage them to use mass transit. The maximum allowable subsidy under the law is $60 a
month, though an agency can choose any subsidy level up to that. The General Services
Administration-facilitated program is currently under used.

If the GSA finds that agencies may offer fare subsidies based on an employee's income, the finding
will reduce the agency's cost of engaging in this program thereby enabling more agencies to
participate while helping low-income workers with the cost of transportation to and from work.

Finding Affordable Child Care

The President directs the GSA, after consultation with all federal agencies, to report on plans to assist
low-income federal workers in finding affordable child care. In particular, the directive asks that
attention be paid to the option to contract with local resource and referral agencies.

The Federal government currently offers agencies two specific options to offer all employees access
to child care: the authority to contract with private child care service providers to run on-site child
care centers, and the option to contract with local child care resource and referral agencies that will
connect Federal em ployees to accessible and affordable child care. The Department of Defense also
runs its own child care center and offers child care subsidies to its employees (an option not
available to other Federal agencies) as allowed under the Military Child Care Act of 1989.

There are over 200 agency-sponsored child care centers around the country and more are being
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
    built. However, while capacity is available in agency-sponsored child care centers the cost of care is
·
    often too high for those in lower income brackets. It is for this reason that the President is asking
    agencies to report on plans to expand the use of their option to contract with local child care
    resource and referral agencies.
