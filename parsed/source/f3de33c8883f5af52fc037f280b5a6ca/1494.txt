     Bruce -- Thursday at 10:00 you are scheduled to attend a DPC principals
     meeting reo outreach strategy for NEXTEA.  I have met with DOT, HUD, DOL,
     HHS, NEC, and OMB staff about ways to promote the President's welfare to
     work transportation proposals.  Here is a one page description of our
     proposal and some outreach ideas.

     1)   What do you think?

     2) NEC staff would like me to share this with them so they can show Gene
     before Thursday:s meeting -- is that okay with you?

     Welfare to Work Transportation Proposals

     The Administration has proposed two welfare-to-work transportation initiatives:

           NEXTEA includes a six-year, $600 million grant program to help states, localities, and
            non-profit organizations develop transportation services to help welfare recipients and
            other low income workers get to jobs.
           The President's budget includes a $10 million expansion ofHUD's Bridges to Work
            demonstration project, which connects residents of five cities (Baltimore, Chicago,
            Denver, Milwaukee, and St. Louis) to suburban jobs and employment-related support
            services to help keep them in the workforce. The projects, developed by
            Philadelphia-based PubliclPrivate Ventures, are supported by private foundations as well
            as HUD and are run by local public-private consortias.

     There is at least one proposal in Congress:

           Senator Specter, Santorum, and others plan to introduce a bill which would authorize
            $250 million a year for a "reverse commute pilot program" modeled after the
            Public/Private Ventures program.

     Possible Outreach Activities/Events/Executive Actions

     There are several types of activities we could consider:

           Administration officials could conduct a briefing for groups concerned about welfare
            reform to inform them of the Administration's NEXTEA and budget proposals.

           The President could hold a White House meeting to highlight the need for transportation
            assistance in the welfare-to-work effort. He could promote his proposal and possibly
            issue an executive order (suggested by a consortium of state transportation officials)
            which would require better coordination of existing federal human service transportation
            programs. Meeting invitees could include:
                   Business, nonprofit, and transportation executives involved in the Baltimore,
                    Chicago, Denver, Milwaukee, and St. Louis Bridges to Work program;
                   National labor and business leaders interested in transportation issues;
                   Bipartisan Congressional sponsors of welfare to work transportation initiatives
                    (i.e., Senators Specter and Santorum);
                   Researchers from PubliclPrivate Ventures, who could possibly release a report on
                    the Bridges to Work program. (The organization plans to release a report in the
                    next month or so but since it examines only at the first six months of program
                    operation, it is unlikely to contain news.)

           The President or Administration officials could visit a transportation site in Baltimore,
            Chicago, Denver, Milwaukee, or St. Louis.
