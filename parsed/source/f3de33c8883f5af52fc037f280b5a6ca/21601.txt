      Last tenn, we attempted to include in the omnibus appropriations package a change to the
       INS's registry date that would have allowed those in the country prior to January 1982 to
       apply to for legal penn anent residency. We were unsuccessful.

      We have engaged in discussions with the Department of Justice to detennine whether
       there are any administrative options that could appropriately address the concerns of those
       who were deterred from applying for amnesty during the 1987-88 window.

Hondurans

      As you know, the Administration fought hard to achieve greater fairness for all foreign
       nationals, including Hondurans, with pending immigration cases who were adversely
       affected by the 1996 changes in rules related to suspension of deportation. While we
       were pleased that the Congress decided to offer relief to some nationalities through
       NACARA, we were disappointed that others were left out. We will continue to urge
       Congress to reconsider the exclusion of these other groups ..

      In addition, we agree that our immigration and refugee policies should treat similarly
       situated people similarly. After careful review, we have concluded that some of the
       Hondurans who came to the U.S. during the 1980s share some ofthe characteristics of
       those Salvadoran and Guatemalan who also sought the protection ofthe U.S. during that
       period.

      Thus, we are prepared to work with Congress to develop an appropriate legislative
       solution for those Hondurans who are in the same position as Salvadorans and
       Guatemalans granted relief under NACARA.

      However, we continue to hold the view that the situation of Hondurans in the United
       States does not warrant the exercise of the President's extraordinary authority to direct the
       Attorney General to delay their deportation.
