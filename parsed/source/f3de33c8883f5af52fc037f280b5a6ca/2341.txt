                    CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
          NATIONAL METHAMPHETAMINE STRATEGY UPDATE
                          MAY 21,1997

Announcement:
Today, in a meeting with Mayors to discuss drug policy, President Clinton announced that
methamphetamine use dropped in 8 key cities and that seizures of the clandestine labs used to
produce methamphetamine increased by 170% in 1996.

Background
Methamphetamine is a synthetic stimulant drug that is cheaper than cocaine in many markets,
produces a longer high than cocaine, and. can produce extreme aggressiveness and irrational
violence.

      Methamphetamine use is dangerous and spreading. While use of the drug has
       historically been concentrated in the West and Southwestern regions of the U.S., it is now
       spreading to the Midwest and the East. Methamphetamine is produced in clandestine
       laboratories, which carry an enormously high risk of fire and explosion.

      President Clinton's Methamphetamine Strategy. The President's April 1996 Strategy
       assessed the methamphetamine threat and established an action plan to avert its further
       spread. In October 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Comprehensive
       Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996-- which incorporates many elements of the
       President's Strategy, including increased penalties and regulatory provisions for precursor
       chemicals. New penalties are scheduled to take effect on November 1, 1997.

Clinton Administration: Taking Action Against the Spread of Methamphetamine
      Increased Seizures. DEA Clandestine Laboratory Enforcement Teams seized 879
       clandestine methamphetamine laboratories in 1996-- a 170% increase over the number of
       labs seized in 1995. Current projections indicate an even higher number of seizures
       will be achieved in 1997.

      Preliminary 1996 Data Shows Meth Use Down. Data from the National Institute for
       Justice 1996 Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) show that in 8 western cities (Dallas, Denver,
       Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, and San Jose) methamphetamine
       use declined between 7 and 52% from 1995 levels. San Antonio showed a modest
       increase: from 1.5% in 1995 to 2.1 % in 1996. 1996 DUF data also indicate that adult
       female arrestees use methamphetamine more than male arrestees, and white arrestees
       were more likely to use the drug than African-American and Hispanic arrestees.

      Targeting the Midwest. In 1996, the Office of National Drug Control Police (ONDCP)
       designated a five-state region in the Midwest (Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and
       South Dakota) as a High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) to address
       methamphetamine use, production, and trafficking. In December 1996, a joint effort
       between the DEA, U.S. Marshals, and state and local law enforcement within the HIDT A
       resulted in the conviction and life sentence of a methamphetamine trafficker in
