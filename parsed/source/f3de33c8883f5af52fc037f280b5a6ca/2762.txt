CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS


        ..     Family and Medical Leave Act, February 5, 1993
               This is an historic effort that allows working Americans to take leave up to 12
weeks          to care for a sick relative or a new child without the fear of losing their job. Over
42             million workers are covered by the new law and it is estimated that as many as
2.5            million workers will take advantage of it annually.

              Student Loan Reform Act, August 10, 1993
               The new direct student loan program will enable more than 16 million borrowers
to             consolidate their guaranteed loans into direct loans. Borrowers will benefit from
lower          fees and the option of income contingent repayment -- taxpayers will save as
much           as $12 billion in seven years.

             Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, August 10, 1993
              After a decade of failed attempts, President Clinton championed the passage of
this          legislation which uses tax incentives and flexible grants to promote economic
        empowerment and private-sector job creation in 104 distressed communities across
        America. Over 500 communities took up the "EZ" challenge, developing
        comprehensive strategies and forging unprecedented partnerships for community

             National Service Act, September 21, 1993
              In 1995, 25,000 AmeriCorps members (more than served during the largest year
of            the Peace Corps) tutored students, immunized children, reclaimed parks and
patrolled              streets -- and received education awards that make college or job training
more          affordable. AmeriCorps is scheduled to increase to 50,000 members in FY1996,
with          a total of almost 100,000 Americans serving our country in the first three years.

              The Brady Act, November 30,1993
               After stalling for several years in Congress, the Brady Bill became law under the
       leadership of President Clinton. The Act requires a five-day waiting period during
       which all potential handgun purchasers are required to submit to a background check.
       $100 million was appropriated for implementation in FYI995 and another $50 million
       is authorized for this year. So far, the Brady Law has stopped more than 60,000
       fugitives and felons from purchasing handguns.

               Goals 2000: Educate America Act, March 31,1994
                The Goals 2000 bill assists communities and states with funds to develop and
        implement their own school improvements based on local, "bottom-up" initiatives.
        Improvements will include ways to strengthen academic achievement, improve
        discipline, increase parent involvement, better utilize technology, and improve
        teaching. Over 47 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and 7 territories have
        received federal grants.
               School-to-Work Act, May 4,1994
                This landmark legislation provides venture capital to spark a nationwide system
for             moving America's young people smoothly from the classroom to a job with a
future.                 Since 1994, many states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,
have received           funds for planning their school-to-work programs, 27 states now have
school-to-work                 state implementation grants, and 21 urban-rural-high poverty areas
have received           grants. In May 1995, over 11,000 students, 2,730 schools, and over
41,000 employers               were involved in school-to-work after just one year.


      The Crime Bill, September 13, 1994
       The $30 billion Crime Bill attacks crime by adding 100,00 police officers, funding
       comprehensive prevention programs and building more prisons. The legislation also
       includes strong punishment for criminals by implementing "three-strikes-and-you're-out"
       for repeat violent offenders. Half the nation's law enforcement agencies -- jurisdictions
of     all sizes -- have received grants to hire more than 31,000 new police officers.

        in San Francisco, 10% in San Antonio, and 9% in Los Angeles County. [Washington
Post,   August 16, 1995]

       Assault Weapons Ban, September 13, 1994
        President Clinton successfully challenged gun interest to ban 19 specific types of deadly
        assault weapons while simultaneously protecting hunters rights by exempting over 650
        hunting rifles.

     Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act, September 23,
      1994
      This legislation creates a national network of non-traditional grassroots community
      lending institutions and will inject $4.8 billion of capital into economically distressed
urban and rural areas.
