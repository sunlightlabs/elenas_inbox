                                           Reducing Violence in the Lives of Children
                                                     December 29,1998

                 Announcement: President Clinton will launch a new Children Exposed to Violence Initiative
                 (or CEVI) designed to improve the justice system's response to children who are victims and
                 witnesses to violence. CEVI will include four components: (1) improving law enforcement
                 response; (2) reforming state and federal laws on child abuse and neglect; (3) increasing public
                 awareness; and (4) strengthening local prevention and intervention. To get this new effort
                 underway, the President will aiso announce the availability of $1 0 million in "Safe Start" grants
                 from the Justice Department. These new funds will help up t015 cities reduce the impact of
                 family, school and community violence on young children in their communities.

                 The Need for Action

                       Too many child victims. Not only do adolescents (12- to 17-year olds) represent
                        approximately 25 percent of all violent crime victims nationally, but millions more are
                        exposed to violence in other ways as well. In fact, of the nation's 22.3 million
                        adolescents, almost 9 million have witnessed serious violence -- with nearly 2 million
                        suffering from .post-traumatic stress disorder.

                       Child victims more at risk. Equally troubling is the fact that children who are abused,
                        neglected and otherwise victimized or exposed to violence are more likely to become
                        criminals themselves. They are more than 50% as likely to be arrested while a juvenile
                        -- and nearly 40% as likely to be arrested when they become adults. They are also at
                        significant risk for substance abuse, mental illness and suicide.

                 What CEVI Will Do

                       Improve Law Enforcement Response. CEVI's first goal will be to improve the justice
                        system's overall response to child victims and witnesses. This means providing law
                        enforcement agents, prosecutors, victim and witness coordinators, and court personnel
                        with the critical information and training they need to prevent against the "secondary
                        victimization" of child victims and witnesses. To meet this need, CEVI will produce and
                        distribute specialized training videos, best practice manuals, and other in-the-field user
                        guides -- such as Forming a Multidisciplinary Team to Investigate Child Abuse, which
                        will be released by the Justice Department today. CEVI will also work to help state and
                        local law enforcement utilize Child Death Review Teams to investigate suspicious child
                        fatalities; expand victims assistance programs; help create "Court Schools" that acclimate
                        children to the courtroom setting; and other similar programs.

                       Reform Laws Dealing with Child Victims and Witnesses. As part of CEVI, the
                        Justice Department will develop federal and model state legislation that increases
                        penalties for violent crimes affecting children, demands accountability from those who
                        kill children through abuse or neglect, and generally improves the court system's ability
                        to address the unique needs of child victims and witnesses.

                                                                                 Automated Records Management :,)~\em
                                                                                 H~\_n!:rll' Conversion

             Increase Public Awareness. CEVI will sponsor a National Summit on Children
              Exposed to Violence and hold follow-up forums to help implement recommendations
              from the Summit. The Summit will be co-hosted by the Department of Health and
              Human Services, major child advocacy organizations, the American Bar Association, and
              many others. Its goal will be to bring together experts in law enforcement, mental
              health, child development, and other related fields -- and to jointly develop a blueprint for
              national, state and local action that will address the issue of child victimization.

             Strengthen Prevention and Intervention. One ofCEVI's most important goals will be
              to help develop and promote local initiatives that: (1) prevent violence against children by
              promoting parent education; (2) intervene and provide services to children exposed to
              violence; and (3) support children within the justice system. A good example of such an
              initiative is the New Haven Child Development/Community Policing (CD-CP) program.
              A partnership between the New Haven Police Department and the Yale University Child
              Study Center, the New Haven CD-CP cross-trains law enforcement and mental health
              professionals and coordinates their response to children in violent situations: Over the
              past few years, the Administration has provided seed funds to help bolster the work of the
              New Haven CD-CP and to help replicate its success in other cities (e.g., Charlotte, NC;
              Nashville, TN; Baltimore, MD; and Chelsea, MA). Today, the President will announce
              the availability of $1 0 million in "Safe Start" grants to help up to 15 more cities
              implement proven initiatives like the New Haven CD-CPo
