                           MEDICARE COMMISSION TALKING POINTS

     Senator Breaux has made a constructive contribution toward addressing the challenges
     facing Medicare. After more than a year of work, the Medicare Commission has helped to
     focus long-overdue attention on the need to modernize the program and prepare it for retirement
     of the baby boom generation. Some of its recommendations should be seriously considered by
     the Congress. The President wants to thank Senator Breaux, Congressman Thomas and all the
     members of the Commission, particularly his appointees (Laura Tyson, Stuart Altman, Bruce
     Vladeck and Tony Watson), for all their hard work.

     The Breaux-Thomas plan, however, falls short in a number of key areas and therefore the
     President cannot support it. In January, the President ou~lined the principles that he would
     use to evaluate the Commission's work product. This plan does not appear to include elements
     that are essential to strengthening Medicare and better preparing it for the twenty-first century.
     In particular, the plan:

           Does not provide necessary new revenues for Medicare and passes up an historic
            opportunity to dedicate 15 percent of the surplus to the program. Every
            independent Medicare expert agrees that the program cannot provide the baby boom
            generation with Medicare benefits without substantial new revenue. Unfortunately, the
            Commission plan does not provide these new revenues. Instead, it recommends waiting
            to act until Medicare's solvency is at risk. But waiting will make the problem harder to
            solve and shift more of the burden to our children. This is why the President proposed to
            dedicate part of the surplus to Medicare immediately, to save some of to day's prosperity
            for tomorrow's needs.

           Increases Medicare eligibility age without a policy to protect against large increases
            in the numbers of the uninsured. As you know, the President is deeply concerned
            about the increase in the uninsured population, particularly among older Americans.
            That is why he proposed allowing some people ages 55 to 65 to buy into Medicare.
            These problems will only get worse under a proposal that postpones Medicare eligibility
            without providing premium assistance for alternative health coverage.

           Proposes a premium support model that could adversely affect premiums for the
            traditional Medicare program and its current package of guaranteed benefits. The
            President is committed to adding competition and private sector approaches to the
            Medicare program, but will not risk harming the existing program or its beneficiaries.
            Senator Breaux's premium support model has the potential to increase premiums for the
            traditional Medicare program or undermine its current package of benefits. The
            President cannot support the plan while such questions about this proposal remain.

           Provides inadequate coverage of prescription drugs. While the President recognizes
            Senator Breaux's leadership in acknowledging the need for prescription drug coverage,
            the Commission's proposal does not provide an accessible, affordable option for all
            beneficiaries. Most respected health economists agree that the current system's
            patchwork coverage of prescription drugs is highly inefficient and expensive. Senator
            Breaux's proposal goes part of the way but not far enough to reform this system.
                                              Hdx-Dump Conversion

The President will build on the Commission's work and develop and propose a plan that
can go the next step in attracting even greater consensus. He has instructed his health care
advisors to take the best ideas from the Commission plan, from members of the Commission not
voting for its plan, and from other members of Congress to craft a proposal that can receive
bipartisan support and truly prepare Medicare for its future challenges. Medicare.is not and
should not become a partisan, political issue and the President is determined to work across party
lines to strengthen and improve the program this year.
