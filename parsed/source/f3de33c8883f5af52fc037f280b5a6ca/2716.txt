TEXT:
Attached, for your review, are two versions of the one-pager for the press
folks; the two differ only in the last section, "Strengthening IDEA for
the Future." The longer version (#2) incorporates a document that we
prepared back in May and goes into more detail on discipline.   The shorter
version (#3) is a little closer to the signing statement.   I think I
prefer #2.  I will leave hard copies of both on your chair, along with a
copy of the draft signing statement and backup material from Education/Pat
Lewis that Diana and I began the evening working with.==================== ATTACHMEN

A Strong Commitment to Disabled Children and Their Parents. Today President Clinton will
sign legislation reauthorizing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
strengthening and reaffirming our Nation's 20-year commitment to disabled children and their
parents. The IDEA demonstrates the Administration's strong support for people with
disabilities, helping ensure that children with disabilities are included in all facets of community
life and are able to become independent and productive citizens.

Continuing Progress on Raising Standards in American Education. The new law is a step
forward for the President's efforts to raise standards and improve American education. The
upgraded IDEA reflects key principles from the Administration's reauthorization proposal, with a
stronger emphasis on educational results and better support for parents. The reauthorization
also protects the safety of all students in the classroom while retaining the essential rights and
protections of disabled students. In addition, the new IDEA has a modified funding formula to
reduce incentives to inappropriately identify children as having a disability.

Bipartisan Cooperation to Achieve Important National Goals. In his State of the Union address,
the President stated that "politics must stop at the schoolhouse door." The legislation the
President is signing today shows what is possible when Democrats and Republicans put aside
their differences and work to prepare America for the 21st Century.

IDEA: Building on a History of Success. Prior to enactment of IDEA as the Education for the
Handicapped Act in 1975, approximately 1 million children with disabilities were shut out of
schools and hundreds of thousands more were denied appropriate services. The legislation has
changed the lives of these children. Many are learning and achieving at levels previously
thought impossible. As a result, they are graduating from high school, going to college and
entering the workforce as productive citizens in unprecedented numbers.

      Nine percent more children with disabilities graduated from high school between 1984
       and 1992.

      Nearly half of all adults with disabilities have successfully completed course-work in
       colleges and universities.

      Youth served under IDEA are employed twice as often as their predecessors, older
       Americans with similar disabilities who were not served under the law.

Strengthening IDEA for the Future. While IDEA has achieved a great deal, we can and must do
better. The new legislation strengthens IDEA in several ways:

      Higher expectations and a stronger emphasis on educational results. The new IDEA



                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
    children to participate and progress in the general curriculum. The new law also
    reaffirms that all children with disabilities must be included in State and district
    assessments of student learning, with appropriate accommodations where necessary. In
    addition, the reauthorized IDEA ensures regular education teachers will be involved in
    planning and assessing children's progress and supports quality professional development
    for all personnel involved in educating children with disabilities.

   More information and better support for parents. Under the new IDEA, schools will be
    required to include parents in meetings to determine student placements. Moreover, the
    new law requires that parents receive report cards on the progress of their children as
    frequently as parents of non-disabled children.

   Protecting the safety of all students in the classroom while retaining the essential rights
    and protections of disabled students. As proposed by the Administration, the new IDEA
    expands the authority of school officials to remove a child for up to 45 days for
    misconduct involving weapons or illegal drugs. The new law gives hearing officers the
    authority now reserved to courts to remove a child whose continued presence would pose
    a substantial risk of injury to the child or others. The reauthorization also makes clear
    that educational services may not be terminated for any child with a disability, overriding
    a recent 4th Circuit decision on cessation of services.

   Reduced costs, paperwork, and litigation. The new IDEA gives school districts financial
    relief through new cost-sharing provisions, and reduces paperwork for teachers, school
    districts and States. In addition, parents and school authorities will be able to resolve
    disputes through new mediation mechanisms.

   Improved funding formula. As proposed by the Administration, the reauthorization
    makes changes in the IDEA funding formula to diminish incentives to
    inappropriately identify children as haviqg a disability, although these changes
    would only take effect in future years as appropriations reach higher levels.

    education;

   Supports quality professional development for all teachers who work with special
    education students and ensures regular education teachers are involved in planning and
    assessing children's progress.

   Reduces paperwork and increases administrative flexibility;

   Promotes mediation to resolve disagreements between parents and schools.
