                         REFORMING THE JOB TRAINING SYSTEM
                                                  March 6, 1998




    "Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have
    today into one single O.I. Bill for Workers, a simple skills grant so people can, on their own, move
    qUickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures. "
                                                                        President Clinton
                                                                    January 27, 1998



With A Vote Scheduled For The Week of March 16th, The President Calls on the Senate to Pass
Job-Training Reform. In' September 1997, the Senate Labor Committee unanimously approved the bill,
S. 1186: Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This bill builds on the President's 1995 proposal for a
GJ. Bill for America's workers to reform the web of job training and adult and vocational education
programs and help prepare the American workforce for the 21 st Century. Senator Lott has indicated that
this bill will come to the floor the week of March 16th. Today, the President calls on the Senate to pass this
important legislation organized around his four basic principles:

        Empowering Individuals. Through Skills Grants, report cards to inform consumers' choices, and
        universal access to core services like job-search assistance, job training reform will empower
        individuals, providing adults seeking training or retraining control over their own careers. This
        customer-driven system replaces the decades-old tradition of making job training decisions for
        adults through bureaucratic systems. This individual empowerment will make the job training
        system more responsive to the skill needs of the market.

        Streamlining Services. Through the consolidation of myriad individual training programs into a
        single system and through the nationwide implementation of One-Stop Career Centers (centers that
        consolidate multiple training and employment programs at the "street level"), this reform effort will
        streamline the job training system. Over the past few years, the Administration has entered into
      . partnerships with over 40 states to build a One-Stop system, and today, there are over 500 in
        operation. This reform would expand One-Stops nationwide.

        Enhancing Accountability. Through tough performance standards - for both governors and
        localities - and by requiring training providers to be certified by, for example, the Higher
        Education Act (HEA), this reform enhances accountability. Performance measures will include
        rates of job retention, earnings, and job placement.

        Increasing Flexibility. Job training reform would provide additional flexibility. For example, the
        Secretary of Labor will have permanent authority to waive burdensome Federal job training rules in
        exchange for performance improvements. This will allow states and local areas to implement
        innovative job-training programs.

A Bill Incorporating These Principles Has Already Passed The House. In May 1997, the House -
with overwhelming bipartisan support - passed a job training reform bill (H.R. 1385: The Employment,
Training, and Literacy Enhancement Act) which incorporates these principles: it allows for individual
empowerment through career grants; it establishes a "full-service" employment and training delivery system;
it establishes indicators of performance to hold states and localities accountable; and it includes additional
flexibility through waiver authority.
                                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                 AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK:
       15 Million New Jobs, Wages Are Rising, and Unemployment Down To A 25-Year Low
                                                March 6, 1998

Today's Report Shows That Wages Are Rising, Unemployment Is Down To A 25-Year Low, and
310,000 New Jobs Were Created Last Month Alone. In 1992, the American economy was barely
creating jobs and the unemployment rate was 7.5 percent. Five years ago, President Clinton put in
place a bold new three-part economic strategy of cutting the deficit to help reduce interest rates and
spur business investment; investing in education, health care, science and technology so that America
was prepared to meet the challenges of the 21 st century; and opening markets abroad so that American
workers would have a fair chance to compete and win across the globe. Today's report shows that this
economic strategy is working for America's workers.

      Unemployment Down to 4.6 Percent -- its Lowest Level in 25 Years.     In 1992, the unemployment rate
       was 7.5 percent. Today, the unemployment rate is 4.6 percent -- its lowest level since 1973. The
       unemployment rate has been below 6 percent for 42 consecutive months and at or below 5 percent for 11
       months now with no signs of inflationary pressures.

      Over 15 Million New Jobs Under President Clinton. Since President Clinton took office, the economy has
       added more than 15 million new jobs -- a faster annual rate of job growth (2.6 percent per year) than any
       Republican Administration in 75 years.

      Fastest Real Wage Growth in Over 20 Years. Last month, average hourly earnings increased 0.6
       percent, and over the past year, average hourly earnings have increased 4.1 percent - far faster
       than the rate of inflation. In 1997, real average hourly earnings increased 2.3 percent - that's the
       fastest real wage growth since 1976. After falling in the 12 years before President Clinton took
       office, real earnings are up since January 1993.

      Highest Share of New Jobs in Private Sector in 75 Years. Since President Clinton took office, the private sector
       of the economy has added nearly 14 million new jobs -- with more than 3.0 million jobs added in the past
       year. Under President Clinton, 93 percent of the 15 million new jobs have been in the private sector -- that's
       the highest percentage since Warren G. Harding was President in the early 1920s.

      Turning the Comer in Basic American Industries. Under President Clinton, basic American industries,
       such as construction and autos, are coming back and leading the world.

       o   1.4 Million New Construction Jobs. After losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous
           four years, nearly 1.4 million new construction jobs have been added since January 1993 -- that's a
           faster annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S Truman was President.

       o   149,000 New Automobile Jobs -- Leading The World Once Again. After losing 35,000 jobs in the
            auto industry during the Bush years, we have 149,000 new auto jobs under President Clinton. For
            the first time since the 1970s, America has led the world in auto production for four years in a row.

       o   614,000 New Manufacturing Jobs. After losing 2.1 million manufacturing jobs during the 12 years
           before President Clinton took office, the economy has created 614,000 new manufacturing jobs since
           January 1993.

      Booming Job Growth Has Helped Lower Unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics.
       Under President Clinton, the African-American unemployment rate has fallen from 14.1 percent to 9.7
       percent. And the Hispanic unemployment rate has dropped from 11.3 percent to 6.8 percent -- as low as
       it's ever been. But we still have more work to do, since these unemployment rates are above the national
       average.
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
   With Low Unemployment, Core Inflation Is The Lowest In 32 Years. In 1997, the core inflation rate,
    excluding the volatile food and eriergy components, was just 2.2 -- that's its lowest level since 1965.
