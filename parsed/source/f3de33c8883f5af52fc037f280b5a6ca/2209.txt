ALREADY SCHEDULED:

    FOP Event (5/15) -- 1) $1.2 million in new scholarships to the children of law
     enforcement officers slain in the line of duty, 2) new Brady forms (to prevent repeat
     of Empire State Building shootings), 3) new statistics on number of officers killed in
     line of duty, and possibly 4) announcement of completion by National Institute of
     Justice of prototype "smart gun" (gun that can be fired only within a certain
     distance of a wristband worn by owner, to protect police officers from being shot by
     their own guns).

    Mayors' Drug Conference (5/21) -- 1) Crackdown on narcotics money laundering by
     expanding the Geographic Targeting Order (successful program requiring financial
     institutions in New York to report information about certain cash transmissions to
     Columbia); 2) DOJ/ONDCP report marking one-year anniversary of President's
     methamphetamine strategy, plus call for follow-up initiatives, and/or 3) report on
     President's pilot program for drug testing in the federal criminal justice system,
     which will describe the success of the program and may call for its expansion.

    Education Town Meeting (5122) -- State sign-ons to our standards/testing plan.
     West Virginia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, are definite; New York, New Jersey may come
     through as well (Missouri and Vermont now seem unlikely).

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS:

EDUCATION:

    Charter school report. Ready for release. A first-year evaluation of what is working,
     and what charter schools need to succeed (the answer is start-up funds, which the budget
     agreement may provide). Could be 5/17 Radio Address.

    DoE "tool-kit"/guide for schools on testing, raising standards, etc. This will be
     based on lessons learned from TIMMS. DoE had proposed issuing this on July 1; Cohen
     is checking to see if this could be ready for town hall.

    Bill-Signing of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Bipartisan special
     education bill, which could pass as soon as 5115. (Should probably be full-blown bill
     signing, for disability community and to stress that education is bipartisan.)

    Read*Write*Now/summer reading initiative. In mid-May, DoE is planning to
     launch the summer reading component of America Reads, to combat summer
     fall-off in reading and reach 1.5 million children with the help of reading and
     tutoring groups.

    100,000 High-Tech Computers Donated to Schools. OVP thinks we can soon join
     with a group of CEOs from the President's Corporate Commission on Educational
     Technology to announce an effort by the companies to bring advanced computer
     technology to our schools by donating 100,000 connected multimedia computers to

                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
      ready until June.

     Hispanic Dropout Report. In late May, the Department of Education will release
      the latest Hispanic dropout report. The report will likely contain mixed news, but
      will be accompanied by an action plan to attempt to tackle the high Hispanic
      dropout rate. (NEC is working on this.)

     Next Generation Internet. NSF will be ready to announce grants connecting 35
      universities to its high-speed network (part of the President's Ncxt Generation
      Internet initiative) in late Mayor June. Could be VOPTUS event.

LAW ENFORCEMENTIF.O.P. EVENT (5/15):

     HUD housing incentives for law enforcement officers to live in their communities.
      I) "Homes for Peace Officers" plan, to give 40% discount on single-family homes in
      major cities for police and firefighters who live in communities where they work; and 2)
      new low-interest loans to facilitate home-ownership for police and teachers who agree to
      live where they work. (DPC is still working on these.)

WELFARE-TO-WORK/CEO EVENT (5/20):

     Welfare-to-Work Transportation Announcement. The President could announce
      pilot grants to 25 states to develop welfare-to-work transportation grants. At the
      same time, he can promote his proposal, contained in his NEXTEA bill, to provide
      $600 million for this purpose.

RADIO ADDRESS OPTIONS:

5117 Radio Address: - - - - - - -
5/24 Radio Address (Memorial Day): _ _ _ _,-----__
5/31 Radio Address (morning of West Point speech): _ _ _ _ _ __

     Child Support legislation. The President can announce (1) transmittal to Congress
      of an HHS report showing that child support collections have increased by 50% in
      the last four years; (2) Treasury Department action, in response to a prior Executive
      Order, seizing certain federal payments that otherwise would have gone to
      delinquent parents; and (3) transmittal to Congress of legislation making it a felony
      to cross state lines to evade child support obligations. POTUS has said he wants to
      do this.

     Sex Offender Registry. We can announce that the interim National Sex Offender
      Registration system -- which POTUS directed the Attorney General to develop last
      summer -- is now up and running. At the same time, POTUS can sign an Executive
      Order instructing the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense to ensure that sex
      offenders released from federal and military prisons are listed in the national
      registry.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
    we build it up in Morgan State speech (definitely won't be ready for speech).
    (Report should be favorable, and consistent with POTUS statement on subject.)

   New legislation on genetic screening. Would place limits on the use of genetic
    information by insurance companies for underwriting purposes. (Could be Radio
    Address or separate event, or included in Morgan State speech.)

MISCELLANY:

   Public Interest in Digital Television Advisory Committee. Sometime before June,
    OVP says we will announce the chairman and members of this new advisory
    committee on public interest standards for digital television. This could give us an
    opportunity to emphasize the President's commitment to free TV, or speak about
    children's TV in the digital age.

   Private Sector Summer Jobs Kick-Off. Will be announced by Labor in late Mayor
    June. Possible DC event with principal other than POTUS? (OPM will be helping
    federal agencies hire about 1,000 DC youth through a separate effort.)

   Fighting Fraud, Abuse and Crime in Public Housing. HUD has several things in the
    works, including: 1) announcement of one-strike-you're-out policy for bad HUD
    landlords; 2) "Get Tough" campaign on public housing personnel who have defrauded the
    government (they are barred from working with the government), and 3) "Get Tough"
    campaign to fight drug dealers, gangs, and violent criminals in public housing. (DPC is
    still working on this.)

   Ryan-White Anniversary. May 20th is anniversary of POTUS signing.                  Possible
    statement for specialty press?

                  POSSIBLE POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR JUNE
                     (in addition to above options not used in May)

       Results of Presidential directive to improve math/science education. A plan for
        improving K-8 math and science education is being developed by an interagency working
        group in response to the POTUS's 3/6 directive (in Michigan state legislature speech).
        Early June seems to be the earliest this can be ready. Could be announced at proposed
        611 0 event for National Math/Science Teachers of the Year.

       New Child Care Regulations. HHS is proposing a regulation on the welfare law's
        child care provisions, which includes extending basic health and safety standards to
        nearly all federally funded child care.

       American Heritage Rivers. Announce details of initiative and ask communities to
        begin nominating rivers for designation. CEQ suggests early June announcement
        in Mt. Vernon near Potomac River.

       New Pension Legislation. Should be ready sometime in June.             NEC is working
        with Treasury, Labor, PBGC, and others on this now.

       Internet V-Chip. When the Supreme Court rules on the Communications Decency
        Act (expected before June 30th) we can challenge makers of Internet browsing
        software to follow Microsoft's lead and include technology that gives parents control
        over what their kids can access on the Internet. Announcement could include
        rating and enforcement components.

       Connecting Children's Hospitals to the Internet. Assuming we are ready to begin
        this effort, the President could visit one of the first hospitals connected.
