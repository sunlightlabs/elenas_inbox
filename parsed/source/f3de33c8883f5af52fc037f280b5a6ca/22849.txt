          PRESIDENT CLINTON AND FIRST LADY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
              LAUNCH THE INSURE KIDS NOW CAMPAIGN PROMOTING
                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE OUTREACH
                            DRAFT: February 23, 1999

Today, the President and the First Lady, along with Governors Carper and Leavitt and Secretary Shalala,
launched the nationwide "Insure Kids Now" campaign designed to enroll every eligible but uninsured
child in Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Building on his efforts to
ensure that it is easy and accssible for families to enroll their children, the President has engaged a
broad-based, bipartisan, public-private coalition to use whatever means possible to educate and assist
families in insuring their children. This includes launching a nationwide, toll-free number set up by the
National Governors' Association in partnership with the White House and Bell Atlantic, allowing
families to get essential information; airing public service announcements on TV and radio; placing the
toll-free number on corporate products; enlisting grass-roots organizations to get the word out; and
stepping up activities by over 10 Federal agencies that interact with working families. Altogether, these
actions will make a major contribution towards the President's goal of covering up to 5 million uninsured
children.

CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE INITIATIVE
The President and First Lady have made improving children's health a priority. Studies show that
children without health insurance are more likely to be sick as newborns, less likely to be immunized as
preschoolers, and less likely to receive medical treatment when they are injured.

   Historic, new options for children. The President, with bipartisan Congressional support, created
    the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1997, which devotes $24 billion dollars
    over the next five years for health coverage for children. Today, 47 states have implemented CHIP
    and expect that they will enroll over 2.5 million children when fully operational.

   Greater challenge: enrolling children. Ensuring that all eligible children get enrolled in health
    insurance is a formidable challenge. Barriers like complicated applications, lack of coordination
    between children's programs, and the perception that working families are not eligible prevent
    uninsured children from getting the coverage that they need. To remove these barriers, the President
    has taken numerous actions to encourage states to streamline their application and enrollment
    processes, accept mail-in applications, and place eligibility workers in convenient locations. He also
    ordered 8 Federal agencies, through their hundreds of programs that serve working families, to
    aggressively assist in enrolling children.

NEW, NATIONWIDE "INSURE KIDS NOW" OUTREACH CAMPAIGN
Building on last year's efforts, today the President and First Lady launched the "Insure Kids Now"
public-private campaign. For the first time, major TV and radio networks, corporations, health care
organizations, religious groups, and other community-based organizations can join Federal agencies in
raising awareness of the importance of children's health insurance.

   Launching "1-877-KIDS NOW" Hotline. Today, Governors Carper and Leavitt unveiled 1-877
    KIDS NOW, a new toll free number developed by the National Governors Association in partnership
    with Bell Atlantic and the Administration, that provides state-specific information about Medicaid
    and CHIP to families in all 50 States. Families calling the line will speak with a person who can
    provide information about eligibility criteria, benefits, and how to apply for coverage. Beginningin
                           Hex-Dump Conversion
    October, HHS will assume responsibility for this line.

   Running public service announcements on national television about Insure Kids Now.
    Beginning tomorrow, to help surround families with information about Insure Kids Now, NBC, ABC,
    Univision, Turner Entertainment, the National Association of Broadcasters, and ViacomlParamount
    will air public service announcements providing information about the importance of health
    insurance and promoting the Insure Kids Now number.

   Airing radio advertisements about Insure Kids Now. Today, the Deparment of Health and Human
    Services (HHS) will begin funding radio ads on Insure Kids Now in 45 States and DC, starting with
    California, Utah, Colorado, Alabama, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina, New Jersey,
    Connecticut, and Maine. Later this year, Radio Disney and Bonneville will run similar ads
    nationwide. Radio advertisements reach over 77 percent of consumers daily, making them an
    incredibly effective way to reach the millions of families with children who are eligible for Medicaid
    or CHIP. In addition, when radio and television are used together as part of a larger educational
    campaign, over 70 percent of people remember the visual images of the television advertisement
    when hearing the radio advertisement.

   Publishing editorials and writing articles about Insure Kids Now. This spring, USA Today will
    publish an editorial and Blue CrosslBlue Shield will publish a full page advertisement in the April
    issue of Time Magazine on children's health insurance. In addition, Pfizer, the American College of
    Emergency Physicians, the American Nurses Association, the United Way, American College of
    Physicians, the National Collaboration for Youth, the Association of State and Territorial Health
    Officials, Wyeth Lederle, Kaiser Permanente, Volunteers of America, the March of Dimes, the Points
    of Light Foundation, Hope for Kids, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the National Education
    Association, and religious organizations from across the country have agreed to put information on
    Insure Kids Now in their product handbooks, circulars, and mass mailings, as well as distributing
    posters featuring the Insure Kids Now number to their clients and constituents. Print media is an
    effective educational tool, especially when used together with other media, because it allows the
    reader to reread and thoroughly digest the information.

   Printing the Insure Kids Now toll free number on commonly used products. Public service
    announcements and advertisements are only one component of a successful communications
    campaign. Building on a series of commitments made in 1998, K-Mart, General Motors, the
    American Dental Hygienists Association and American Medical Response have joined the Insure
    Kids Now campaign and have pledged to put the new toll free number on grocery bags, toothbrushes,
    diaper boxes, pharmaceutical products, child safety seats, and on the sides of buses.

   New Federal efforts to promote children's health insurance outreach. The President has both
    legislative and administrative proposals to help enroll children in Medicaid and CHIP, including Over
    $1.2 billion in his FY 2000 budget for children's health outreach, through proposals that will help
    states access additional funding for successful outreach activities, and new actions by the Federal
    Task Force on children's health outreach, including launching the new "InsureKidsNow.Gov"
    website today that provides information about state programs and the Administration's public-private
    outreach campaign; distributing 145,000 posters to over 20,000 health centers, providers, and other
    grantees; sending 92,000 USDA employees information about outreach on March 8 on their wage and
    earning statements, including the national toll-free number; and sending a letter and posters with the
    Insure Kids Now number from the Department of Justice to all 170 sites in Operation Weed and
'"'   ,                         Automated Records Management System
