DRAFT

June     , 1999

(Senate)



S. 1122 - DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 2000
(Sponsor: Stevens (R), Alaska)

        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdrninistrationO,s views on S. 1122, the Department of Defense
Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the Senate Appropriations
Committee.   Your consideration of the AdrninistrationO,s views would be
appreciated.

        The Committee has developed a bill providing requested funding for
many of the AdrninistrationO, s priorities. We appreciate the Committee" ,s
decision to address readiness and modernization efforts.   However, S. 1122
raises several budgetary and policy concerns, outlined below.

Funding Levels

        The Committee bill provides funding requested for many of the
AdrninistrationO,s priorities.  We appreciate the CommitteeO,s decision to
provide the AdrninistrationO,s overall FY 2000 request of $262.9 billion.
In addition, we are pleased with the CommitteeO,s decision to fully fund


the military pay raise, personnel benefits, and critical readiness
programs at requested levels. However, the Administration is concerned
that the Senate bill, which exceeds the PresidentD,s budget by nearly $1.4
billion, will drain critical resources from other programs.  When combined
with expected defense increases in other Senate bills, defense funding
would exceed the PresidentD,s request by about $5 billion.  The
Administration believes that the PresidentD,s budget request correctly
addresses the many needs of the military and that this additional funding
is not necessary.

Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund

        The Administration opposes the $300 million reduction to the
request for the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF)
The Committee rightly notes that it is difficult to develop standardized
budgeting procedures for contingency operations due to the inherent
uncertainty of these operations. This uncertainty, however, prescribes
that funding should remain in the flexible OCOTF account to cover
unforeseen costs that emerge over the course of a year, even if it is in
excess of currently identified requirements. Reducing the OCOTF account
would only make it more difficult for the military services to cover
contingency operations costs as they emerge, potentially jeopardizing
military readiness. Therefore, the Administration urges the Senate to
restore the OCOTF account to the requested level. The Administration, of
course, will continue to work with the Committee to improve accounting for
contingency operations costs and spending.

Rescissions & Other Reductions

        The Administration is concerned about some of the rescissions and
reductions in the billD,s general provisions.   The Committee bill would cut
$209 million for civilian personnel under-execution, even though the
Department projects minimal under-execution.   The Senate Committee also
has cut $250 million for fuel savings, though recent changes in world fuel
markets indicate that prices are likely to increase. These reductions
would under fund pressing defense readiness programs in the PresidentD,s
request. We will, of course, work closely with the Congress on
constructing these provisions in order to preserve a prudent balance of
defense priorities.

Incremental Funding of LHD-8 Amphibious Ship

        The bill would provide $500 million for advance procurement and
construction of LHD-8, a large-deck amphibious ship for the Marine Corps.
The bill also directs that the Navy fund the balance of the acquisition
costs incrementally.  The Administration opposes incremental funding of
major weapon systems, including construction of ships.   Incremental
funding would make completing construction of this program dependent upon
the action of future Congresses. Moreover, to continue construction of
LHD-8, the incremental funding approach would require the Navy to identify
funds for LHD-8 in each year of its long-range plan that are not currently
budgeted. These funds would have to come at the expense of other
important programs.   The Administration supports acquisition of LHD-8 and
plans to fully fund this ship in FY 2005, when construction is required to
begin in order to meet current ship replacement schedules.

Unrequested Funding for Modernization

        The Administration opposes funding increases proposed for
procurement ($2.4 billion) and research, development, test, and evaluation


($1.9 billion) programs. The PresidentD,s budget represents a careful
balance between readiness and modernization programs that supports current
needs and long-term modernization priorities in the context of overall
government priorities. Unrequested items funded by the committee include
$300 million for the National Guard and Reserve Equipment account and $87
million for one EC-130J aircraft for the Air Force.



Chemical Demilitarization Program

        The Committee's reduction of $145 million to the request for the
Chemical Demilitarization Program prior to identification and
implementation of cost-saving measures is problematic. A reduction of
this magnitude would cause a breach in the Chemical Weapons Convention
deadline for the destruction of these chemical weapons.  Furthermore, the
reduction would increase life-cycle costs and increase the risk to local
communities surrounding the chemical storage sites as the destruction of
these chemical agents is delayed.  The Administration strongly urges the
Senate to provide the $1.169 billion requested in the PresidentD,s FY 2000
Budget.

Combating Terrorism

        The Administration objects to the $339 million increase to the
$1.0 billion request for combating terrorism, an allocation that could
unintentionally reduce critical readiness spending.

Remote Area Denial Artillery Munitions

         The Administration strongly opposes the committeeD,s deletion of
Remote Area Denial Artillery Munitions production funding.   RADAM is an
artillery-delivered, anti-armor munition that is essential to Army and
Marine Corps maneuver warfare capabilities as well as to their ability to
protect troops in combat.   RADAM is also essential to ending u.s.
anti-personnel landmine (APL) deployments outside of Korea by 2003, a key
foreign policy goal. As the current artillery-delivered, anti-armor
system is removed from service, RADAM will be the only system available to
provide u.s. commanders the same force protection and maneuver warfare
options in the future.   Deletion of RADAM production funds will result in
either a failure to meet our policy objectives regarding APL or in
exposure of u.S. troops to unacceptable and unacceptable degradation of
u.s. ground combat capabilities.

Network Technologies

        The Committee bill makes cuts to two important technology
programs:  $25 million to the AdministrationD,s $70 million request for 0000,
s Extensible Information Systems/Deeply Networked Systems program; and, $9
million to the $40 million request for the Next Generation Internet (NGI)
program. As we enter an era of information-based warfare, it is crucial
that DoD remain at the forefront of networking research.   The Extensible
Information Systems is a major part of the President~,s Information
Technology for the Twenty First Century initiative to accelerate
information technology research.  The DoDO,s NGI is part of the
Government-wide Next Generation Internet initiative to 'develop
technologies to make Internet-like communications faster.   Each reduction
represents, in addition to the defense effects, a seven-to nine-percent
reduction in spending for the inter~agency initiatives.   Failure to
provide the requested funding would result in delayed progress and lost
·

    leadership for DoD in these areas.

    Objectionable General Provision

            Section 8073 of the Committee-reported bill would prohibit the use
    of funds to transfer defense articles or services to another nation or to
    an organization in connection with international peacekeeping or
    humanitarian operations, unless the President gives 15 days advance notice
    to Congress. The provision includes no waiver for national security
    emergencies such as providing weapons to troops supporting U.S. forces
    engaged in hostilities.  Because the provision intrudes on the President ,s
    authority as Commander-in-Chief, the Administration would construe it as
    permitting such expenditure, with the notification occurring as soon
    thereafter as possible.
