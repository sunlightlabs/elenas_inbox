     Supplemental Security Income NewChildhood Disability Standard
     February 6, 1997


     The welfare law required SSA to provide a new tightened definition of childhood disability for
     the SSI program, which provides monthly cash payments and Medicaid for low-income disabled
     children. SSA was challenged with formulating a standard that both meets the intent of Congress
     to tighten eligibility and ensures that severely disabled children and their families are protected
     under the new law. SSA is announcing that standard at 2 PM today.

     SSA's Standard:

           The Administration is confident that the standard in the regulations SSA has developed
            meets the letter and the spirit of the law in ensuring that needy children with severe
            disabilities are protected.

           Numbers: Of the approximately 950,000 children currently receiving benefits, CBO
            estimated that between 100,000 and 260,000 children would lose benefits under the new
            eligibility definition in the welfare law. SSA estimated last year that 190,000 children
            would lose benefits; SSA estimates that under its new standard the total number of
            children who will be removed from the rolls is 135,000 -- in the low range of CBO's
            initital estimates for the law.

           Type ofDisability. Most of those affected under SSA's standard can be categorized as
            children with less severe mental impairments -- such as less severe learning disabilities or
            behavioral disorders. The new rules provide guidelines for evaluating more severe .
            impairments -- such as Down's Syndrome, severe mental retardation or autism -- to
            ensure that such children remain eligible under the new standard. Because disability
            determination is a complex issue, regulations in this area are difficult and complicated.
            For a description of the more specific details of the regulation, the SSA Commissioner
            should be contacted.

     Medicaid Coverage:

           The President is also proposing a legislative change to soften the impact of the eligibility
            changes. The legislative change would allow disabled children who lose their SSI
            eligibility under the new definition of childhood disability to retain their Medicaid
            health coverage -- so that the medical needs of these families continue to be met.

     Ongoing Evaluation:

           SSA will track the effects of the implementation of this law. If they discover that
            revisions or improvements in the law are needed, they will recommend such changes.
