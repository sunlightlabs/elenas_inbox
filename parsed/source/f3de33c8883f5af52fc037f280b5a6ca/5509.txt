MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         BRUCE REED
              GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:      New AIDS Initiative

Overview

        We have developed an $115 million initiative for your FY 1999 budget to improve AIDS
treatment and prevention programs. This increase would go to expand programs that are critical
to preventing and treating this epidemic, including the AIDS Assistance Drugs Programs
(ADAP) which extends life~saving new treatment therapies to low-income and underserved
populations. It would focus on three populations: women, minorities (the two populations with
the fastest growing rate of AIDS), and children.

Background on AIDS Funding

        Since you came into office, you have dramatically improved programs that extend
treatment and prevention for people with AIDS. You have ensured that Medicaid covers
protease inhibitors (a significant step for AIDS treatment, as Medicaid provides health coverage
for half of all people with AIDS). Ryan White Programs have increased by 200 percent since
FY 1993, funding for research at NIH has increased by 50 percent, and funding for the ADAP
program has increased 450 percent since 1996.

        However, the AIDS community was extremely critical of the Administration in the last
budget because we failed to propose major increases in discretionary spending, and the Congress
far out spent us in this area. Moreover, this spring the Vice President asked the Health Care
Financing Administration to look into the feasibility of doing a budget neutral Medicaid
demonstration to extend life saving therapies to Medicaid patients earlier, when treatments are
thought to be more effective. After much analysis, HCF A concluded that even a modest
demonstration would be quite costly and could not meet its budget neutrality requirements.
Nevertheless, the Vice President's request raised expectations in the community, and they are
disappointed that we will not be able to take such an approach. There is no doubt that the AIDS
community is watching the Administration's actions closely, particularly with regard to the
FY 1999 budget, and will push for your continued support for AIDS research and treatment.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
The Proposal

        The AIDS office is recommending, and we agree, that you propose an $115 million
increase in your FY 1999 budget. (OMB is currently recommending $100 million). This
funding could be spent in a number of ways. We could break out spending between existing
discretionary programs that emphasize prevention and treatment. We recommend a substantial
increase in the ADAP program (around $70 million) as new treatments of this disease are
increasingly proving effective and have not been extended to many who need them. We would
also recommend modest increases to cities, states, and community health centers, all of whom are
overwhelmed by this epidemic as well as the CDC prevention education programs, which could
specifically focus on improving education for minorities and young people.

       In response to the criticism HHS is receiving with regard to their finding that a budget
neutral demo is not possible, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle is in the early stages of having HCFA
determine if it is possible to develop legislative options for a modest Medicaid demonstration to
expand eligiblity to Medicaid for people with HN earlier in the progression oftheir disease. By
proposing legislation, this demonstration would not have to be budget neutral. It would be
capped to a few states (and more likely communities within these states) and would cost $40-$50
millionover five years (or $8 to $10 million per year). If we develop such an approach, we
could lower the discretionary dollars to $100 million. It would also send a signal that the
Administration is willing to consider changing Medicaid to respond to the new treatment needs
of this epidemic. We would have to find some Medicaid savings to finance that proposal.

       Although the $115 million that we are suggesting falls far short of the unrealistic $400
million the AIDS advocates are pushing, it is a significant investment with justifyable policy that,
according to the AIDS office, should be sufficient to help quiet any major criticism from the
community.
                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                        December 4, 1997               Hex-Dump Conversion


MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:       Race and Health Initiative

Overview

        As a major component of your race initiative, we have developed a proposal that would
commit the nation to an ambitious goal of seeking to eliminate racial disparities in health care by
the year 2010. There are severe disparities in a number of critical health areas for
African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. In some cases these
minority groups suffer from diseases as much as five times as often as whites. To effectively
reduce these disparities will require a Department-wide effort to find innovative approaches and
apply them nationally across all health programs. The FY 1999 budget could take a
two-pronged approach to this issue: (1) expanding our most effectiv<: public health programs and
directing them to focus specifically on the problem of eliminating these disparities; and (2)
funding competitive grants to thirty communities and monitoring them closely to improve our
knowledge on how to close these gaps. New strategies learned through these grants would then
be applied at a national level.

Racial Disparities in Health Care

        The initiative would focus on the most severe racial disparities in the following health
areas: infant mortality, cancer, heart disease and stroke, AIDS, immunizations, and diabetes.
Some of these disparities are quite startling. For example, infant mortality rates are
2 % higher for Mrican-Americans and 1% times higher for American Indians and many Hispanic
groups. For cancer, Vietnamese women suffer from cervical cancer at nearly five times the rate
of whites, while Latinos have two to three times the rate of stomach cancer. African-Americans
have a 35 percent higher cancer death rate. For example, African-American men under the age
of 65 get diseases such as prostate cancer and heart disease at nearly twice the rate of whites,
while Native Americans suffer from diabetes at nearly three times the average rate, while
African-Americans suffer 70 percent higher rates. Racial and ethnic minorities account for
25 percent of the population yet make up 54 percent of all AIDS cases. The demographic changes
that are anticipated over the next decade magnify the importance of addressing some of these
disparities. As these minority populations with poorer health status are expected to grow, we
have an <?pportunity to dramatically improve the future of the nation's health if we can find
effective ways to close these gaps.                                                  .


                                                                       Automated Records Management System
    Validation
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
           Proposing the ambitious goal of reducing these dramatic health disparities would receive
    overwhelming support from the public health community, by groups such as the American Public
    Health Association, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society as well as
    from minority groups such as the Intercultural Cancer Council, the American Indian Healthcare
    Association, the National Hispanic Council on Aging, the National Council of Black Churches.

    Proposal

            HHS is proposing to spend $200 million in FY 1999 for this initiative, while OMB is
    currently recommending $30 million and supports using these dollars to build on existing
    programs rather than the grant proposal discussed below. We believe that we can develop a
    strong initiative with $100 million in your FY 1999 budget. This funding would be
    supplemented by a few other initiatives, such as the proposed increases in AIDS funding, some
    of which will be targeted specifically to minorities.

    ·      Improving Effective Public Health Approaches to These Problems. We recommend
           that you propose $70 million to apply some of our most effective public health
           approaches directly to reducing these disparities. These public health programs have
           strategies that have proven effective as well as longstanding relationships with the
           minority health community and other community organizations committed to addressing
           these problems. Partnering with these organizations, these programs would build on
           their existing new knowledge and proven public health strategies to focus on how to
           eliminate these disparities.

    ·      Thirty Community Grants to Develop New Strategies to Eliminate Disparities. To
           eliminate racial disparities in health care will require developing new approaches to
           reducing these disparities, as we currently do not have the answers as to how to solve
           many of these problems. We recommend you propose $30 million to target thirty
           communities that develop innovative and effective ways to address these disparities.
           Each community, chosen through a competitive grant process, would develop
           intensely-focused efforts to address one of the six health areas. HHS would develop a
           working group that includes outside minority health experts to assist and monitor these
           communities and apply approaches across all health programs. They would also hold
           periodic meetings and conferences to educate the public health and minority community
           about new effective strategies to reduce these disparities.

    ·      Begining Today to Reduce Disparities. To ensure that we begin this initiative
           immediately, we are identifying ways in which the FY 1998 increases in these areas can
           be used to begin to address racial disparities. For example, AIDS education and training
           centers are beginning a new partnership with the Indian Health Service to develop new
           approaches to educate health providers about training and prevention. Also, the National
           Cancer Institute will expand efforts to help recruit more Hispanics into clinical trials.
