MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed
                         Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:               DPC Weekly Report


      Health Care -- Unveiling of the Budget's indusion of Jeffords/Kennedy and other
work incentives initiatives for individuals with disabilities: On Wednesday, you will
participate in a bipartisan event to unveil the Administration's new, $1.7 billion (over 5
years) work incentive initiative for individuals with disabilities. Your package includes
funds to finance: (1) the Jeffords-Kennedy Work Incentives Improvement Act, which
provides disabled persons wishing to work and retain health coverage the ability to buy
into Medicaid (at the states' option) and Medicare; (2) a new tax credit for work related
impairment expenses (such as transportation and personal assistance services that are
essential to enabling people to work); and (3) a new $35 million initiative that would help
fund assistive technologies that are critically important to empowering individuals with
disabilities to be able to work. Your proposal will receive strong support from the
disability community, but its pro-work nature is also extremely attractive to the
Republicans. Because of strong, bipartisan interest from the Finance Committee and the
Labor and Human Resources Committee, the Jeffords-Kennedy and the other components
of this initiative have an excellent chance of passing this year.

         Health Care -- Medicare managed care payment regulation and HMO withdrawals:
BBA '97 requires HCFA to announce its plan to implement a risk adjustment payment
mechanism for Medicare managed care plans by next Friday. Risk adjustment payments
were passed to compensate plans that are serving disproportionately sicker patients, as well
as to lower those payments for those plans who are serving disproportionately healthy
beneficiaries. Since currently available data still indicate that HMOs are attracting fairly
healthy populations, the implementation of this new system would, in most cases, reduce
payment rates to plans -- by as much as 15 in 2000. The HMOs are now suggesting
that, if this system is put into place, much greater numbers of participating plans will be
forced to leave Medicare. In the wake of last year's HMO withdrawals and pressure from
Congress to increase the payment rates, we have decided to phase in the risk adjustment
over a 5 to 6 year period in order to ease the financial impact these provisions will have on
the industry. We have the administrative authority to do this. While not immediately
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                                                                  2

and completely implementing this system this year will save the industry hundreds of
millions, if not billions of dollars, it will probably still seek additional redress (including
repeal) by the Congress. However, we believe a modern Medicare program needs a risk
adjustment mechanism in place to more accurately reimburse its plans.                  We are
encouraging HHS, however, to announce this action with a series of "carrot and stick"
initiatives aimed at avoiding additional withdrawals.

        Health Care -- Medicare Commission update: The Medicare Commission met
earlier this week. Since it has at most two meeting left before its March 1 reporting
deadline, the press is paying greater attention to its progress, especially its premium support
idea. Premium support is a term coined by Reischauer and Aaron to described a
combined defined contribution and defined benefits model. . In practice, this means that
beneficiaries would still be entitled to a minimum set of benefits, but the government
payment for those benefits would be limited in some way. Coverage of this policy
discussion suggests that the Commission is much closer to agreement than is the case.
Many issues remain unresolved and there has yet to be independent scoring by CBO
(which has declined to work for the Commission) or HCFA Office of the Actuary (which
hopes to complete its estimates in two weeks). There is growing consensus among all
members that there should be a prescription drug benefit. However, there is no
consensus over its design, financing, management, and scope (i.e., do all beneficiaries or
only those in managed care receive it). There is also private acknowledgment by virtually
all members (and a public statement from Bruce Vladeck) that significant new revenues are
needed to extend the life of the Trust Fund for any period of time. Chairman Breaux is
calling on us to give technical assistance as he develops his mark, which he said would
include the set of principles to guide reform developed by Congressman Dingell.
However, Dingell and other Democratic appointees remain concerned that they will be
asked to vote for premium support that does not meet these principles. There will be a
principals' meeting next week to coordinate our public position and ongoing working
relationship with the Commission.

        Crime -- Victims: On January 25, the Vice President will announce over $300
million in FY 99 Justice Department funds to provide assistance for victims. Funds from
the Crime Victims Fund help to support nearly 3,000 victims service agencies nationwide,
such as domestic violence shelters, child abuse and sexual assault programs, and programs
to assist survivors of homicide. Money in the Crime Victims Fund comes solely from
fines paid by criminal offenders, collected by U.S. Attorneys, federal courts, and the
Bureau of Prisons. Over 90 percent of the funding available in the Fund go toward state
victim compensation and assistance programs. The remainder is used for training,
technical assistance, and demonstration projects. All 50 states will receive funding,
including: $43 million for California; $17 million for New York; $23 million for Texas;
$15 million for Florida, $12 million for Illinois, and $3 million for Arkansas.
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                         3


             Welfare -- More People Are Working: On December 30th, we released the first
     work participation data under the welfare refonn law and the final numbers turned out to
     be better than we reported in the December 11th weekly -- all 36 states plus D.C. who were
     subject to the 25 percent work participation rate for FY 1997 met the target (West
     Virginia's data is still incomplete but HHS is working with the state to obtain final data).
     Nationwide, 28 percent of all adults on welfare were participating in a direct work activity
     or another welfare-to-work activity such as job search or vocational education. The
     percentage of welfare recipients in direct work activities (employment, work experience,
     and community service) has tripled since 1992. Census data confinns a dramatic shift
     towards employment among welfare recipients, with the percentage of single women on
     welfare who were working increased by half, from 40 percent in 1992 to 60 percent in
     1997. In addition to more people on welfare working, estimates based on Census data
     show that 1.5 million individuals who received welfare in 1997 were working in March
     1998 -- a 28 percent increase since March 1996.

            Immigration -- Central America: On December 30, 1998 the Attorney General
     designated Honduras and Nicaragua for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for a period of
     18 months. This action will pennit nationals from Honduras and Nicaragua to remain in
     the U.S. and receive work authorization during this period. Though the conditions in El
     Salvador and Guatemala are not severe enough to warrant a TPS designation, the Attorney
     General also decided to extend the stay of removals of EI Salvadorans and Guatemalans for
     60 days -- until March 8, 1999 -- in order to preserve the status quo in these countries while
     the U.S. continues its reconstruction efforts.

              We are also moving forward with our plans to work with Congress to obtain
     legislative parity for those Salvadorans and Guatemalans covered by the Nicaraguan
     Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). As you recall, NACARA,
     enacted in late 1997, authorized virtually automatic pennanent status for Nicaraguans and
     Cubans living in the United States, while providing Salvadorans and. Guatemalans with
     only an opportunity to be considered under the more lenient (pre-1996 Act) rules for
     suspension of deportation (a fonn of immigration relief leading to pennanent status). Our
     proposed legislation would provide equivalent treatment for Salvadorans and Guatemalans
     to what the Nicaraguans and Cubans received under NACARA.

             Tobacco -.: Meeting with State Attorneys General: We and Bruce Lindsey met
     this week with Mike Moore, Christine Gregoire, and Dick Scruggs to discuss tobacco
     strategy. They would like to work with us on a bipartisan basis to enact legislation to let
     states keep all the tobacco settlement funds so long as they spend a portion of the funds on
     public health and children's programs such as child care. They also think it may be
     feasible to attach language reaffirming FDA's authority over tobacco products and
     increasing the per pack tobacco excise tax. However, they wamed that there would be
~   "   . ,                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                                                                                4

              fierce resistance to any federal efforts to administratively recover funds by withholding
              Medicaid dollars. As you know, the Justice Department and HHS believe we are legally
              obligated to recoup the federal share of Medicaid recoveries. We plan in the budget to
              assume no recoupment in FY 2000 to provide time for us to agree wi th the states and the
              Congress upon a mutually acceptable menu of programs on which funds would ·be spent.
              However, beginning in FY 2001, we would recoup the full amount of the federal
              government's claim against the states (57 percent of their recoveries), about $4 to $5
              billion a year.. We believe this is not only consistent with our legal obligations, but will
              provide an incentive to enact a mutually acceptable menu in the next year.

                      The budget will also include an excise tax of 55-cents per-pack beginning in FY
              2000 (raising about $6.5 billion each year) as well as the acceleration of a previously
              enacted 15-cent per-pack increase to FY 2000 (adding a $1 billion or so in the first and
              second years). These funds will reimburse the federal government for the tobacco-related
              health costs in the Department of Defense, Veterans Administration, and the Federal
              Employees Health Benefits Program.. Finally, the budget will include $20 million for the
              Justice Department to bring suit against the tobacco industry for Medicare costs.

                     Food Safety - Food Additives: The Food and Drug Administration announced
              this week that it will expedite review of petitio.ns for food additives that could cut the risk
              of foodborne illness caused by dangerous contaminants such as Salmonella and
              Cyclospora. Currently, the food additive petitions are considered in the order in which
              they are received and can take years to be approved. The FDA estimates that of the
              hundreds of food-additive applications now pending, only a few are designed to improve
              food safety. Foodborne illnesses cause an estimated 9,000 deaths and 33 million illnesses
              in the United States each year. The announcement was described in a short article in
              Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.
