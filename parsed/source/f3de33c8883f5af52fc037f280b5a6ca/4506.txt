  TEXT:
  If you want paper for our 10:30 meeting on FLSA, here's a one-pager that
  is part background, part talking points.  (Apparently Rahm and Craig Smith
  are going up to Vermont to be with the Governors this weekend, so we need
  to produce general talking points for them.)

                                        New Shaw Draft

Background: Rep. Shaw is trying to forge an alliance between Governors and Congressional
Republicans on workfare and Fair Labor Standards Act requirernents. Governors of both parties
are concerned about the cost of compliance with FLSA and other labor laws, including payment
of the minimum wage, and the cost of FICA taxes for workfare participants. Shaw is trying to
get Governors to endorse a new draft bill.

   Shaw's new draft tries to reclassifY people in workfare programs as ''trainees.'' This would
    deprive them of the protections of the FLSA, including the minimum wage, and other labor
    laws, including full health and safety protections and protection against discrimination.

   It would also significantly weaken the welfare law's tough work requirements for people on
    welfare who perform "community service." Instead of being required to work for 20 hours
    a week in 1998, someone doing community service would only have to work as many hours
    as the state could afford at the minimum wage. The balance of a recipients' time could be
    spent on job search and education activities.

    We are also concerned that the definition of community service is so broad that it could
    include nearly all subsidized work, allowing low benefit states to require less than 20 hours
    of work from nearly all their "working" recipients. DOL is also concerned that it would
    weaken labor protections for those performing community service.

   The bill would also exempt community service positions from FICA and unemployment
    taxes, which we indicated during the balanced budget negotiations that we were willing to
    do. In fact, we agreed to such an exemption as part of a last-minute compromise on the
    Balanced Budget Act that fell apart for other reasons.

Talking Points:
   Worker protection laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, should apply to workfare
    participants in the same way they apply to other workers. No one doing real work should
    be paid a subminimum wage or should be subject to health and safety hazards.

   Rep. Shaw's latest proposal would deprive workfare participants of those protections,
    including payment of the minimum wage.

   It would also weaken the welfare law's tough work requirements -- requirements that were
    part oflast year's bipartisan agreement to reform welfare, and which states have only just
    begun to implernent.

   Paying working welfare recipients the minimum wage and giving them other worker
    protections will promote the goals of welfare reform, because it will give them the ability to
    support their families and break the cycle of dependency.

   The Administration is prepared to work with states to ensure that they can comply with the
    law, without undue financial burden, and meet the welfare law's work requirements.
