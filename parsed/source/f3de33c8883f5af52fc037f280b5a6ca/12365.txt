Here's my first take on this.  I'm not sure if you want to lay things out
this way or not.  Let me know what you think.

Two points: (1) The explosives piece is not totally new.   It was burried
in our international crime bill that received very little attention. (2) I
imagine you'll need to raise the long guns piece w/Podesta and the rest of
the WW management types. Controversial stuff, but definately gets to the
heart of the whole issue.  If we don't support the long guns piece, we'll
have to come up w/some language to cover borns, destructive devices.
They're captured by the definition of 'firearms," but not by McCarthy's
assaults provision.

               THE GUN ENFORCEMENT AND ACCOUNT ABILITY ACT
                               April 27. 1999

Today, President Clinton will propose new legislation to strengthen federal firearms laws
and make it more difficult for kids and criminals to have access to guns and explosives.
The President's proposed bill -- The Gun Enforcement and Accountability Act -- will
include new proposals to ban juvenile possession of semi-automatic assault rifles Iand other
long guns], require Brady background checks for the purchase of explosives, and help law
enforcement trace more crime guns to their source.

BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE BRADY LAW. Since taking effect in 1994, the
Brady Law has prevented over a quarter of a million felons, fugitives, mentally unstable persons,
and other prohibited purchasers from buying handguns. In November 1998, the National Instant
Criminal Background Check System (NICS) took effect, allowing access to a fuller set of
records that law enforcement officials can use to conduct checks of all prospecti ve gun purchases
-- not just for handguns. To date, NICS has conducted over 2.6 million background checks on
gun purchasers, and has stopped over 27,000 illegal gun sales. The President's legislation will
propose strengthening the Brady Law by:

      Extending the Brady Law's requirements to purchases of explosives. Under
       current law, no Brady background check is required to buy explosives. The
       President's bill will help cut off easy access to explosives by requiring Brady
       background checks before the sale of explosives, and by extending the same
       prohibitions in our gun laws to prospective purchasers of explosives. The bill will
       also prohibit convicted felons from purchasing any quantity of black powder, which
       is used to make most pipe bombs, and require explosives dealers to keep records of
       their sales of black powder.

      Closing the gun show loophole on Brady background checks. In 1998, there were an
       estimated 4,442 gun shows held in states across the country. An estimated 25-50 percent
       of the firearms sold at these gun shows are sold by unlicensed sellers arid not subject to
       background checks. As a result, gun shows can provide a forum for illegal firearms sales
       and gun trafficking. In fact, a recent review by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
       Firearms (ATF) of314 gun show investigations found that 46 percent of these
       investigations involved the purchase or sale of firearms by felons, and 34 percent
       involved the sale of firearms later used in serious crimes, including homicides. To end
       this policy of firearms being sold at gun shows on a "no questions asked" basis, the
       President's bill will require: (I) Brady background checks on all firearms transferred at
       gun shows, with the assistance offederally-licensed dealers; (2) Vendors to report
       information on firearms sold at gun shows to the ATF, so that they can be traced by law
       enforcement if they are later used in crimes; and (3) Gun show promoters to register with
       the ATF and notify it of all gun shows.

      Making the Brady waiting period permanent. The Brady Law's waiting period
       requirement expired last November when the NICS took effect. Although the NICS has
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

       generally improved law enforcement's ability to conduct background checks, a permanent
       waiting period will allow local law enforcement officers to check additional,
       non-computerized records, as well as provide cooling-off time for handgun purchases.
       Accordingly, the President's legislation wilJ: (1) require a minimum 3-day waiting period
       for all handgun purchases; (2) add up to an additional two days to the waiting period if
       law enforcement officers need more time to clarify arrest records; and (3) require gun
       dealers to notify local law enforcement officials of alJ proposed handgun purchases.

      Extending the Brady Law to violent juveniles_ Although violent youth convicted in
       adult courts are barred from owning firearms as adults, the same is not true for
       youth convicted of serious violent crimes in juvenile court. Violent juveniles should
       be treated as adults for their adult crimes, and stopped from getting weapons to
       hurt again. The President's legislation will permanently ban all violent juveniles
       from buying guns, so that they cannot purchase a gun on their 21st birthday.

RESTRICTING YOUTH ACCESS TO GUNS. Keeping guns out of the hands of
juveniles has been one President Clinton's top priorities. He fought for and signed
legislation prohibiting the juvenile possession of handguns, requiring "zero tolerance" for
guns in schools, and establishing the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) to
help identify and arrest adults who traffick guns to children. The Gun Enforcement and
Accountability Act will do even more to restrict unauthorized youth access to guns by:

      Banning juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles [and other long guns).
       In 1994, President Clinton fought for and signed the Youth Handgun Safety Act,
       which generally banned the possession of handguns by juveniles under the age of 18,
       and prohibited adults from transferring handguns to a juvenile -- except for in
       limited circumstances and with written parental consent. It remains legal,
       however, for juveniles under the age of 18 to posses -- and if they are over 18 to buy
       -- semiautomatic assault rifles manufactured before the Assault Weapons Ban went
       into effect [as well as rifles, shotguns and other long guns.) The President's bill will
       propose extending the provisions of the Youth Handgun Safety Act to assault rifles
       [,.shotguns, and all long guns.)

     Holding adults responsible for child access to guns. Child Access Prevention (CAP)
      laws promote gun safety and responsibility by holding adults responsible if they allow
      children easy access to loaded firearms. According to a study published by the Journal
      ofthe American Medical Association, CAP laws help reduce fatal unintentional shootings
      by an average of23%. The President's legislation will impose felony penalties on adults
      who knowingly or recklessly allow a child to have unlawful access to a gun that is later
      used and caused death or injury.

     Requiring child safety locks for guns. Child safety locking devices can reduce the
      unauthorized use of handguns, by a child at play or a teen looking to commit a
      crime. Many youth have to look no further than their own home to get their hands
      on a gun: it is estimated that one third of all privately-owned handguns are left both
                                                                          Hex.Qump ConvelSlOn

       loaded and unlocked. To address this problem, the President's bill will require
       federally-licensed firearms dealers to provide a child safety lock with every gun they
       sell.

      Increasing penalties for transferring guns to juveniles. The President's bill will
       increase penalties for adults who transfer handguns to juveniles knowing that they
       will be used in a violent crime -- establishing a new mandatory minimum sentence of
       at least 3 years and up to 10 years.

CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL GUN TRAFFICKERS In 1996, President Clinton
launched the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative in 17 cities to help trace crime guns to their
source, as well as identify and arrest the adults who traffick firearms to our children. Since that
time, YCGrr has been expanded to 20 more cities and conducted more than 200,000 traces for
local law enforcement. Additionally, over the last 2 years the President has proposed hiring
more than 280 new ATF agents and more than 40 new federal prosecutors to arrest gun
traffickers and violent criminal, and crackdown on illegal gun sales.

      Allowing law enforcement to trace all firearms used in crimes. Under current law
       federally-licensed gun dealers are not required to keep any records pertaining to the sale
       of used firearms. As a result, it is much more difficult for law enforcement to trace used
       firearms that are later used in crimes. The President's legislation will require that federal
       gun dealers keep the same records for both new and used gun sales -- and report the
       manufacturer, model, and serial number of all used guns sold to ATF's National Tracing
       Center.

      Doubling the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII). Over the past 2
       years, the President has expanded the YCGrr initiative to 37 cities -- helping them to trace
       all crime guns to their source, to identify illegal gun markets, and to crackdown on gun
       traffickers. Last year, ATF initiated over 300 investigations in these cities, which
       involved over 3,300 illegally trafficked firearms. The President's bill will increase the
       number of cities participating in YCGn over the next 4 years to a total of 75

      Increasing penalties on gun kingpins. To send a strong message to gun runners
       that their illegal gun trafficking will not be tolerated, the President's bill will double
       the maximum penalty for illegally selling firearms without a license without a
       license (from 5 to 10 years of imprisonment), and enhance the current penalty for
       offenses where over 50 firearms have been illegally trafficked.

STRENGTHENING THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. In 1994, the President fought for and
signed into law legislation to ban the manufacture and importation of the 19 deadliest assault
weapons, their copies, and large capacity ammunition clips. Last year, the President also to took
action to ban the importation of over 50 models of modified assault weapons. The President's
bill strengthens the assault weapons law by:

      Banning the importation of all large capacity military clips. Although the 1994
                                                               Hex-Dump ConversIon

assault weapons law banned the future domestic manufacture and importation of
large capacity military magazines (LCCMs) that hold more than 10 rounds of
ammunition, LCMMs manufactured before the law's enactment were grand
fathered. Because of the difficulty in determining when LCMMs manufactured by
foreign companies were made, it has become relatively easy for foreign gun
manufacturers to circumvent the ban on LCMMs. As a result, the President's bill
will close this loophole by banning the importation of aU large capacity clips --
regardless of when they were manufactured.
