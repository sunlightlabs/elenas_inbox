PRESIDENT CLINTON AND FIRST LADY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON HOLD ROUNDTABLE ON
EQUAL PAY AND URGE PASSAGE OF PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT
WITH NEW WAGE COLLECTION PROVISION
April 7, 1999

 Today at the White   House, President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton will host a   rountable with working women and business leaders to
discuss the need to   ensure that every working American receives equal pay
and
equal opportunity.    A recent report of the President's Council of Economic


Advisors found that, although the gap between womenD!,s and menD!,s wages
has
narrowed substantially since the signing of the EqUal Pay Act in 1963,
there
still exists a significant wage gap that cannot be explained by differences
between male and female workers in labor market experience and in the
occupation, industry, and union status of jobs they hold.

 The President will reiterate his call for prompt passage of the Paycheck
Fairness Act, which would strengthen wage discrimination laws and provide
for
additional training and public education efforts on equal pay. The
President
also will announce that Senator Tom Daschle, the chief sponsor of the
Paycheck
Fairness Act, will include a new data collection provision in the bill.
That
provision will direct the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
to:
(1) determine what additional data is needed to enforce the federal wage
discrimination laws effectively and efficiently, and (2) issue a
regulation to
provide for collecting this data. Finally, the President will urge
Congress to
provide the $14 million he requested for the Equal Pay Initiative in his
Fiscal
Year 2000 budget.

Paycheck Fairness Act with New Data Collection Provision

The President again will urge Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act,
legislation introduced by Senator Tom Daschle and Congresswoman Rosa
DeLauro,
which would strengthen laws prohibiting wage discrimination. The
legislation
will be reintroduced with a new data collection provision added.  This
legislation includes:

New Pay Data Collection Provision. This provision would require the EEOC to
complete a survey of data currently available for use in enforcing federal
wage
discrimination laws and to identify additional data collections that would
enhance enforcement of these laws.  In addition, the provision would call
upon
the EEOC to determine the most effective and efficient means possible to
collect pay information from employers and issue a regulation, within
eighteen
months, to collect pay data identified by the race, sex, and national
origin of
employees.

Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The legislation would
provide
full compensatory and punitive damages as remedies for equal pay
violations, in
addition to the liquidated damages and back-pay awards currently available
under the EPA.  This proposal would put gender-based wage discrimination
on an
equal footing with wage discrimination based on race or ethnicity, for
which


uncapped compensatory and punitive damages are already available.

-more-

Non-Retaliation Provision. The bill would prohibit employers from
punishing
employees for sharing salary information with their co-workers. Many
employers
are currently free to take action against employees who share wage
information. Without the ability to learn about wage disparities, it is
difficult for employees to evaluate whether there is wage discrimination.

Training, Research, and Pay Equity Award. The bill would provide for
increased
training for EEOC employees to identify and respond to wage discrimination
claims; research on'discrimination in the payment of wages; and the
establishment of an award to recognize and promote the achievements of
employers in eliminating pay disparities.
