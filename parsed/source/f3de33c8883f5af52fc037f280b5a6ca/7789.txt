                       The Commerce Committee Manager's Package
                         will Dramatically Reduce Youth Smoking

The Commerce Committee manager's package contains significant improvements over the
underlying bill which will help to reduce youth smoking and to protect the public health. With
these improvements, the bill meets each of the President's principles for comprehensive tobacco
legislation. The improvements include:

Tougher Lookback Surcharges:

      The manager's amendment contains an uncapped company-specific surcharge of$l,OOO
       per youth smoker for every youth smoker by which the company misses its youth
       smoking targets. This surcharge represents twice the lifetime profits that a company
       eams from any youth smoker. The companies will not be able to pass these
       company-specific surcharges onto price, because any price differential between
       companies will dramatically affect their share ofthe adult market.

       At the levels specified in the manager's amendment, company specific surcharges will
       reduce profits by $640 million for every 10 points. The Treasury Department and OMB
       estimate that a 20-point miss in 2003 would represent one-third of total industry profits.
       By affecting their bottom line in this dramatic fashion, the company-specific surcharges
       in the manager's amendment will provide a significant incentive for tobacco companies
       to change their behavior and reduce sales to children.

      The manager's package also raises the cap on industry-wide lookback surcharges from
       $3.5 billion per year to $4 billion per year. The Treasury Department and OMB estimate
       that iftargets are not met and the full $4 billion industry-wide surcharge is levied, the
       price of a pack of cigarettes will rise by about 35 cents.

Enhanced Environmental Tobacco Smoke Protections:

      The manager's package provides that a state can opt out of the national environmental
       tobacco smoke standard only if the state is able to demonstrate to OSHA that it has an
       ETS standard at least as protective of the public's health.

Spending:

      The manager's package contains key provisions to fund important public health
       programs, health research, and assistance for farmers. It also provides funding to states
       to be used for a variety of programs, including child care.

      Approximately 22 percent of expected revenues from the legislation will go to fund
       research at NIH, CDC, and AHCPR. Another 22 percent will fund smoking cessation
       programs, prevention and education programs, international tobacco control efforts, and a
       variety of enforcement efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize smuggling
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
      and crack down on retailers who sell tobacco products to children. All proceeds from
      lookback surcharges will go to prevention and education programs.

     Forty percent of expected revenues will go to states, with half unrestricted and half to be
      used for designated purposes -- the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the Safe
      and Drug-Free Schools Program, Eisenhower Grants, child welfare programs (Title
      N-B), the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Title V Program, Substance Abuse grant
      programs, and a limited match for the Children's Health Insurance Program. This entire
      list is directed at the health and well-being of children and families most in need of
      assistance.

     The remainder of expected revenues from the legislation will go to protect tobacco
      farmers and to provide assistance to their communities, through the mechanisms of the
      LEAF Act.

     Excess revenues will go to the Medicare program.

Improved Liability Provisions:

     The manager's package ensures that the bill's liability provisions (i.e., the settlement of
      state lawsuits and the annual damages cap) apply only to companies that agree to accept
      sweeping advertising restrictions and to comply with important provisions of the law (i.e.,
      lookbacks and annual payments), even if those provisions are invalidated by the courts.

     The manager's package raises the annual liability cap from $6.5 to $8 billion (indexed for
      inflation), the same amount as the cap in the Chafee-Harkin bill. It also removes liability
      protections for parent companies and affiliates; ensures that the industry's attorneys will
      be subject to suit as under current law; and allows plaintiffs claiming injury from disease
      to use evidence of addiction in their lawsuits.

     The manager's package strengthens the provisions in the bill that link liability protections
      to the achievement of youth smoking targets. Under the amended legislation, a company
      that misses its targets by 20 percenf or more has the burden of showing both that itdid not
      engage in affirmative misconduct and that it used best efforts to reduce youth smoking in
      order to escape the loss ofliability protections.

Elimination of Antitrust Exemption:

     The manager's package eliminates the blanket antitrust exemption contained in the
      underlying bill, which was not necessary to achieve the goals of the legislation and could
      have had anti competitive effects.
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

                            Company-Specific Youth Lookback
                          Surcharge will Change Industry Behavior

        The uncapped company-by-company surcharge of $1 ,000 per youth smoker contained in
the Commerce Committee manger's package will provide a significant incentive for tobacco
companies to change their behavior and reduce sales to children. Industrywide surcharges are
passed directly to price, and are designed to drive up the price to discourage teens from smoking.
 Company-specific surcharges are designed not to drive up the price of cigarettes, but to come
straight out of the companies' bottom line ifthey sell to children. Companies cannot pass
company-specific surcharges onto price, because any price differential between companies will
dramatically affect their share of the adult market.

      Without a company-specific surcharge, any company can still make a profit by selling to
       kids. The $1,000 per youth smoker surcharge contained in the manager's amendment
       will force a company to surrender twice the lifetime profits it makes from addicting a teen
       in the first place.

      This penalty is uncapped, and will take a large bite out of after-tax profits. The total
       after-tax profits of the domestic tobacco industry are $5 billion ($7.5 billion pre-tax).
       The Department of Treasury estimates that after-tax profits will drop to about $3.4 billion
       by 2003 (in constant dollars) under the McCain bill. The company-~pecific surcharges
       reduce the companies profits by about $640 million for every 10 points. A 30-point miss
       would reduce profits by over $1.9 billion, which is more than half of projected profits. A
       60-point miss would reduce profits by $3.8 billion, which amounts to more than projected
       total profits.

      These penalties are large enough to prevent companies from being able to pass them onto
       price. Assume, for example, that the total volume of cigarettes sold in 2003 is 15 million
       packs (about halfway between CBO and OMB estimates). Because Philip Morris's
       market share is 50%, or 7.5 million packs, a 30-point miss would cost the company about
       $1.2 billion. If Philip Morris passed that amount along to price, it would have to raise
       the price of Marlboros by 16 cents a pack, or $1.60 a carton. A similar price differential
       between Philip Morris and RJR cigarettes in 1993 cost RJR so much of its adult market
       share that the company has never recovered.

      In addition, any company that misses its targets by more than 20% stands a significant
       chance oflosing its liability protections altogether under the manager's amendment. As
       amended, the bill provides that a company that misses its targets by this amount has the
       burden of showing both that it did not engage in affirmative misconduct and that it used
       best efforts to reduce youth smoking in order to escape the loss of liability protections .




                                                                 ....
                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
Stronger Anti-Smuggling Provisions:

      The manager's amendment will strengthen the anti-smuggling provisions in the bill, so as
       to prevent the emergence of contraband markets. The bill, as amended, will create a
       "closed distribution system" for tobacco products so that only licensed entities can sell or
       buy products; it will provide states with resources to establish or improve retail licensing
       systems; it will require manufacturers to mark packages for export to prevent their
       diversion; and it will establish and enforce strong penalties for violations. A very similar
       sys,tem has worked to control smuggling of alcoholic beverages for over sixty years.

                     The Commerce Committee's Manager's Package
       Funds Critical Public Health, Health Research, Farmers, and State Programs

The Commerce Committee's manager's package funds critical funding for public health, health
research, farmers and farming communities, and the states, including significant funds for child
care.

Public Health Programs: 22 percent of funds (about $14 billionl5 years)

The bill funds critical public health programs, including tobacco prevention and education
programs, cessation programs, counter-advertising, Indian health services, international tobacco
control efforts, and a variety of enforcement efforts at both the federal and state levels to
minimize smuggling and crack down on retailers who sell tobacco products to children.

Health Research Programs: 22 percent offunds (about $14 billion/5 years)

The bill provides 22 percent of funds for research at the National Institutes of Health, the
National Science Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research. The bill would also fund a demonstration to permit Medicare beneficiaries
to participate in certain federally sponsored cancer clinical trials.

Farmers and Communities: 16 percent offunds (about $10 billion/5 years)

The bill provides 16 percent of funds to assist the transition of both flue-cured and burley
tobacco growers and their communities. The bill contains $28.5 billion for tobacco farmers and
their communities over 25 years, including payments for lost tobacco quota; payments for sale of
quotas; payments for community economic development block grants; a worker transition
program; and higher education assistance programs.

Grants to States: 40 percent offunds (about $26 billion/5 years)

Recognizing the important role states have played in enabling this legislation, the manager's
amendment provides that 40 percent of funds be transferred to the states, $196.5 billion over 25
years, with half unrestricted and halfto be used for designated programs for the health and
well-being of children and families most in need:

              Child Care and Development Block Grant
              Maternal and Child Health Block Grant
              Child welfare (Title IV -B)
              Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration grants
              Safe and Drug-Free Schools
              Professional Development (Eisenhower) grants
              Match for the Children's Health Insurance Program (limited to 6 percent of
              restricted funds)
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

If states were to spend their restricted funding in proportion to current federal expenditures, and
use 6% for the Children's Health Insurance Program, at least 40% ofthe funds, or over $5 billion
over five years, would go to child care.

Medicare: Additional Revenues                                                              .,

In the event that the bill generates more receipts than estimated, the balance of funds will be
directed to the Medicare HI Trust Fund.

                             The Manager's Amendment Narrows
                              the Scope of Liability Protections
                                  for the Tobacco Industry

Senator McCain's Manager's Amendment contains key improvements in the bill's civil liability
provisions. As amended, the bill establishes a higher, $8-billion-per-year cap on damages,
which will be available only to tobacco companies that finally change the way they do business
by agreeing to restrict advertising to youth and abide by the terms of the legislation rather than
tying it up in court. The new version of the bill also removes special protections for parent
companies of tobacco manufacturers.

The Manager's Amendment significantly improves            0" the bill reported out of the
Commerce Committee by:

      Ensuring that the bill's liability provisions -- i.e., the settlement of state lawsuits and the
       annual damages cap -- apply only to companies that agree to accept sweeping advertising
       restrictions and to comply with the key terms of the law, even if those provisions are
       struck down;

      Raising the annual liability cap from $6.5 billion to $8 billion (the same amount as in the
       Chafee-Harkin-Graham bill), with all damage judgments to be paid by the industry;

      Strengthening the provisions in the bill that link liability protections to the achievement
       of youth smoking targets, by removing liability protections from a company that misses
       its targets by 20 percent or more unless it proves that it used best efforts to reduce youth
       smoking;

      Permitting suits against parent companies and affiliates of tobacco manufacturers, as well
       as their attorneys;

      Ensuring that individuals with tobacco-related disease can use evidence of their addiction
       in suits against tobacco companies; and

      Ensuring that tobacco companies cannot escape their obligations by making fraudulent
       transfers or declaring bankruptcy.

Moreover, the Manager's Package retains important features of the bill reported out of
Committee:

      The bill contains no limits on class action lawsuits and does not limit the amount that
       anyone can recover from a tobacco company; and

      The bill assists plaintiffs who have minimal resources in suing big tobacco companies by
       recognizing two well established facts -- that nicotine is addictive, and that the use of
       tobacco causes a wide array of diseases.

                       The Commerce Committee Manager's Package
                        Contains Tough Anti-Smuggling Provisions


The Commerce Committee manager's package creates a strong licensing and enforcement system
that will minimize smuggling by creating a closed distribution system for tobacco products,
labeling all products for export, and imposing tough penalties on manufacturers and other firms
involved in smuggling.

An Effective Licensing System is the Key to a Closed Distribution System: To prevent black
market activity, the manager's package regulates tobacco products in a manner similar to the way
the federal government has regulated alcoholic beverages for over 60 years.

Under this closed distribution system, only manufacturers, wholesalers, exporters, importers, and
distributors that hold a federal license would be allowed to engage in those businesses. Licenses
would be issued based on certain specified criteria and could be revoked or suspended for certain
specified violations. Those conducting business without a permit would be subject to civil
monetary penalties of up to $10,000 per offense, a prison term of up to five years, and property
forfeiture. Tobacco companies implicated in smuggling would lose their liability protections.
Licensed entities would be authorized to sell tobacco products only to other licensed entities.
Licensing of retailers would be done by the states.

Additionally, all tobacco product packages would be marked with a serial number to facilitate
tracking, and all exported packages will be labeled FOR EXPORT FROM THE UNITED
STATES to prevent them from being smuggled back into the U.S. and sold illegally.

A Closed Distribution System will Prevent Black Market Activity: A closed distribution
system will ensure that products moving outside the legal channels of distribution can be easily
earmarked and targeted for prosecution. This system would drastically limit smugglers' ability
to enter products into a legitimate distribution channel. Potential black marketeers would not be
able to move products through legitimate wholesalers or distributors. Nor would they be able to
sell products to retail consumers at local convenience stores or other licensed retail outlets.
Instead, without a way to place contraband in the market legally, smugglers would have to sell
cigarettes outside channels of legitimate distribution. This would be very risky and criminal
provisions and penalties would act as a significant deterrent to persons contemplating the
unlawful diversion of tobacco products.

Funding for Enforcement: The manager's amendment authorizes funding for anti-smuggling
enforcement as part of the public health spending account and enables the Secretary of the
Treasury to collect fees to cover enforcement costs.

                              Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation
                                 will Not Cause Bankruptcy

Claims by the tobacco companies that the McCain bill will drive them into bankruptcy are not
convincing for two key reasons. First, the legislation is designed to facilitate the pass-through of
manufacturer payments to the prices of tobacco products, minimizing the impacts on the profits
of the manufacturers themselves. Second, the industry has a significant cash flow and net assets
to absorb the reduced volume as prices rise.

The Payments are Made by Tobacco Consumers, Not Tobacco Manufacturers: The primary
goal of comprehensive tobacco legislation is to reduce youth tobacco use. The single most
effective means of accomplishing this goal is to raise the price of tobacco products. As a result,
the McCain legislation and other bills facilitate the pass-through of industry payments to the
price of tobacco products. Mechanisms such as the allocation of industry payments by market
share, and volume adjustments which reduce industry payments as volumes fall, will ensure that
these payments are made by consumers, not manufacturers.

Payments Made by Tobacco Consumers Have Modest Impact on Manufacturer Profitability:
The opinion of the objective experts at the Federal Trade Commission is that even large price
increases will have little impact on profits. They find that the AG settlement, which raised
prices by 62 cents, lowered the profitability of the tobacco industry by only about 15%. By their
method, the $1.10 price increase in the McCain bill would lower profitability by less than 25%.

The Tobacco Industry Has Substantial Financial Resources: The U.S. tobacco industry is
large, well-diversified, and financially strong; the operating earnings for the top five tobacco
manufacturers was $23.6 billion. The industry leader, Philip Morris, is particularly well
positioned to absorb decreases in their domestic tobacco earnings:

      Their stock is currently valued at almost $100 billion.
      They had $4.7 billion in domestic tobacco operating profits in 1997.
      They also had operating profits of$4.6 billion on their international tobacco business.
      They are also a well diversified company that has operating profits of almost $5 billion
       from other lines of business such as food and beer.

Even the most vulnerable in this industry, RJR Nabisco, has substantial financial resources:

      For 1997, RJR Nabisco's domestic tobacco business had operating profits of $1.5 billion
      The company also has a rapidly growing international business which had $670 million in
       operating profits in 1997.
      In addition to their tobacco businesses, RJR Nabisco has a substantial asset: its holdings
       of 80 percent of Nabisco, valued at almost $10 billion dollars. This exceeds by $5
       billion the company's outstanding debt (excluding Nabisco).

                             The McCain Bill's Price Increase will
                           Substantially Reduce Youth Smoking and
                                  Prevent Premature Death

The single most important step we can take to reduce youth smoking is to raise the price of a
pack of cigarettes significantly. The Treasury Department analysis has found that the $1.10
price increase in the McCain bill will, by itself, reduce youth smoking by 32% in 2003. Taken
in conjunction with a conservative estimate of the impact of the other non-price provisions in the
legislation, such as access and marketing restrictions, the overall impact is an average 42%
reduction in youth smoking and premature deaths in every state.

Why do we need to significantly increase the price of cigarettes to prevent youth smoking?

According to the Treasury Department, the per-pack price 톓ncrease in the McCain bill combined
with advertising and access restrictions will result in an average reduction of 42 percent in
underage teenage smoking in the year 2003. The percentage reductions in underage teen
smoking and resulting premature deaths range from 33-36 percent in states like Washington,
Massachusetts, and Michigan, to 47-51 percent in states like Wyoming, Tennessee, and
Kentucky. Fifteen states will see reductions above 45 percent in 2003.

Over the next five years, the number of young people kept from smoking would be about 3
million young people for the country as a whole. Individual states will see reductions ranging
from a few thousand in the smaller states up to about 248,000 in California and 205,000 in
Texas. And about a million young people will be saved from premature death, including 56,000
in Florida, 57,000 in Ohio, 37,000 in Michigan, 83,000 in California, and 24,000 in Missouri.

Can one million lives really be saved over 5 years if Congress passes comprehensive
legislation?

The Treasury Department's analysis shows that the McCain bill's price increase of $1.1 0 per
pack over five years coupled with sales and advertising restrictions will reduce underage smoking
by nearly half, stopping 3 million teens from smoking and saving a million lives over the next
five years. This analysis includes a conservative estimate that advertising and access provisions
will reduce teen smoking by 15 percent. The rest of the reduction is attributable to the price
increase.

Don't some experts say a price increase will have no effect on young people's behavior?

In fact, there is a substantial consensus in the economics literature that price increases have a
dramatic impact on youth smoking. The model used by the Treasury Department reflects that
consensus. Indeed, an independent analysis from the Congressional Budget Office recently
reviewed the literature and concluded that youth smoking is very responsive to price.
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
Doesn't the international evidence contradict this contention?

Again, the clear consensus of the U.S. literature, as confinned by CBO, is that youths are very
responsive to price in their decisions to smoke. International comparisons are much less
infonnative for the response of youths in the U.S. to price changes. If one insists on
international comparisons, perhaps the best one to use is Canada, were a doubling of the price of
cigarettes over the 1981 to 1991 period led to a 50% fall in youth smoking -- almost exactly what
would have been predicted by Treasury's model.

                     Background on Youth Smoking Elasticity Estimates


The Treasury Model

      The Treasury model of youth smoking starts from a participation elasticity of -0.7 at the
       current price level of about $1.95 - which means that a 10% increase in price above its
       current level would reduce the number of teen smokers by 7%.

      But this relationship only holds for very small price changes. For larger and larger
       price increases, the Treasury model predicts sOl;newhat smaller proportional reductions in
       teen smoking. This reflects the fact that the teens most likely to respond to price signals
       are also the first to be discouraged from smoking by a price increase.

      Using this model, a $1.10 increase in the real price of cigarettes is projected to reduce
       youth smoking by 32%. Since a $1.10 increase in the real price in 2003 represents a
       53% rise, the associated "average" elasticity is actually _0.6. 1


Previous Academic Studies

      A number of studies have attempted to estimate the responsiveness of youth smoking in
       the U.S. to price changes - the participation elasticity, or the change in the number of
       teen smokers due to price changes. This literature is based on comparisons of youth
       smoking rates in high and low tax states, and on changes in youth smoking within states
       as tax rates change.

      The CBO recently summarized this literature by stating that most of the evidence points
       to participation elasticities ranging from -0.50 to -0.75. The Treasury estimate is in the
       range used by the CBO.

      The results from this literature are shown in the Table below. Because differences in
       elasticity estimates may be less intuitive, the table shows - for each analysis of youth
       smoking - the projected reduction in teen smokers from a $1.10 price increase (along
       with the Treasury estimates). This approach recognizes the fact that the Treasury model
       allows the elasticity to decline for larger price increases.




        IThe semi-logarithmic demand function underlying this analysis is based on a standard
model used to predict overall cigarette demand. Under it, every dime ($0.10) increase in price
reduces demand by the same percent, but since it is doing so from a smaller and smaller base at
each step, the absolute reduction in teen smoking from each 10 cent increment declines slightly.

        It is clear that the Treasury estimate is within the range of professional consensus on this
         question. Indeed, our estimates are more conservatjve than what most ofthe recent work
         in this area would suggest.

        One study which estimates a very different response from the remainder of the literature
         (Wasserman et al.) focuses exclusively on the late 1970s. During this period some
         surveys indicate that youth smoking fell precipitously without a price increase. We
         believe a more appropriate interpretation of the data during the late 1970s is that youth
         smoking was driven down by the broader dissemination of facts abo.ut smoking's dangers:
          According to one major survey, only half of 12th graders saw a great risk in smoking a
         pack or more of cigarettes a day in 1975 - the lowest level in the survey - but this
         number increased by nearly 25% between 1975 and 1980. Thus, rather than indicating
         that price does not affect youth smoking, we believe this data shows that other things can
         influence teens in addition to price.

        This same problem has led to a misinterpretation by some of the Evans and Huang paper.
         As Professor William Evans of Maryland pointed out in a recent letter to the Commerce
         Committee, the findings of his paper have been misquoted. As noted in the Table above.
         the estimate that Evans stands behind is very close to the Administration estimate. The
         confusion over his findings arises from the fact that his estimates which include data from
         the late 1970s show a smaller youth elasticity than his estimates which focus on the 1980s
         and 1990s. As Prof. Evans has noted, however, the data are less reliable for this earlier
         period; in addition, as noted above, this was an era when non-price factors were driving
         teen smoking down in the face of constant prices.


The Cornell Study
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

       Some have cited the recent study by DeCicca et al. as refuting the previous literature. In
        fact, this study finds higher estimates than the remainder of the literature when standard
        estimation techniques are used on their full sample of 8th-12th graders?

       The study does find smaller effects when they choose the particular sample of 12th
        graders who weren't smoking in 8th grade, and try to model whether they start smok.ing.
        But there is no obvious explanation for this anomalous result; after all, removing from
        their model a population that is more addicted to cigarettes - individuals smoking from
        8th to 12th grade - should raise, not lower, the elasticity estimate. It is troubling that
        dropping only 5% of their sample - the 5% of teens that are most addicted - reduces
        their estimate so dramatically.

      The likely explanation for this anomalous finding is problems with their empirical
       methodology. A recent re-analysis of their data by Professors Thomas Dee of Georgia
       Tech and William Evans of Maryland has found these results to be very sensitive to the
       particular sample restrictions imposed by the Cornell authors. As these experts note,
       "The results appear to be purely an artifact of the way that the authors constructed the
       analysis sample". When a broader sample of observations is used, there is a very
       significant effect of taxes on youth smoking in their onset model- indeed, the results are
       quite comparable to the previous literature.

      This partly explains why the results of the Cornell study are so statistically imprecise.
       For example, in this particular model, they estimate that a $1.10 price rise would reduce
       smoking onset by only 7%. However, given the level of statistical imprecision in their
       model, their findings would be equally consistent with a reduction in youth onset of 50%
       or more from this $1.10 price increase - a range which encompasses the Treasury
       estimate, as well as their own estimates using a more straightforward methodology.

      One criticism levied by DeCicca et al. against the earlier literature is that it does not
       control for differences across states at a point in time that might determine youth smoking
       propensities; low tax states may have high smoking because of other regulatory or
       cultural factors. But their approach does not solve this problem; it still relies on
       point-in-time comparisons of smoking onset across states, making it difficult to separate
       out other differences across those states. Other studies address this problem much more
       directly. Chaloupka and Grossman (1996) do so by including a variety of state
       characteristics, including state anti-tobacco regulations. Evans and Huang (1997)
       address the problem even more directly by examining only the effect of within-state price
       changes on youth smoking. The fact that these estimates are so similar to that used by
       Treasury highlights the robustness of the conclusions, and indicates why the previous
       scientific consensus is not undermined by one set of anomalous results.

graders.

International Evidence

     There has also been much recent attention paid to the fact that youth smoking remains
      high in other countries with much higher cigarette prices. In particular, Wall Street
      analyst Martin Fe1dman noted in his testimony of March 19th that youth smoking rose in
      the U.K. between 1988 and 1996, despite a 26% rise in the real price of cigarettes. The
      inference that is often drawn from this type of evidence is that higher prices won't deter
      youth smoking in the U.S.

     But these international comparisons do not tell us much of anything about the response
      ofyouth in the Us. to price changes. The fact that youth smoking rates remain high in
      other countries reflects other cultural factors that influence youth to smoke, and is not a
      rejection of the fundamental relationship between price and demand. And increased
      smoking among youth in the U.K. between 1988 and 1996 may have more to do with
      other factors, such as a recession which raised youth unemployment rates by 25% over.
      this period, than with changes in the price of cigarettes.

     In light of this concern, it is certainly preferable to rely on careful, controlled analysis of
      U.S. teen smoking than on this type of anecdotal international evidence.

     Nevertheless, if one is going to make international comparisons, then the most
      appropriate one would be to Canada, since it is more similar to and faces many of the
      same cultural influences as the U.S. The two economic studies which estimate the
      effects of cigarette prices on Canadian teens are both consistent with the findings in the
      U.S. literature - teens are not only responsive to price changes, but they are more
      responsive than adults. In fact, the Canadian youth elasticity estimates are higher than
      those for the U.S.

     Moreover, the pattern of youth smoking in Canada confirms the sensitivity of youth to
      price changes. In 1981, Canada had a youth smoking rate that was about 50% higher
      than that in the U.S. Over the next decade, Canada raised its cigarette prices by over
      lOO%, and teen smokingfell by almost half. During this period there were no
      substantial change in teen smoking rates in the U.S., so by 1991 Canada's teen smoking
      rate was lower than ours. The implied Canadian elasticity of -0.42 is very close to the
      estimate that would be computed by the Treasury model (which allows the price
      responsiveness to fall as the magnitude of the price increase grows) for this large a price
      rise, which is an elasticity of -0.48.

     Teen smoking then rose again in Canada between 1991 and 1994, as Canada lowered
      dramatically its federal excise taxes. Of course, teen smoking was on the rise in the U.S.
      over this period as well, so it is not as easy to attribute all of the rise in Canada over this
      time Beriod to price impacts. But the fact remains that for the country most comparable
      to the Us., teen smoking rates fell as prices rose, and rose as prices fell.

                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

                                    Advances Public Health

The Long-Term Economic Assistance for Farmer (LEAF) Act, sponsored by Senator Ford and
Hollings and included in S.1415, contains critical protections for farmers and farming
communities, to ensure that they are not adversely affected by comprehensive tobacco legislation.
 Key provisions of the LEAF Act include:

      Necessary Funding: The bill is supported by a wide variety of farming groups because it
       contains sufficient funds for tobacco farmers and their communities, $6 billion over the
       next three years and continued funding over the next 25 years, including resources for
       crucial community assistance to help farmers and farming communities adjust to the
       reduced demand for tobacco that would occur under the bill. The funds would go
       toward: payments for lost tobacco quota; payments for sale of quotas; payments for
       community economic development block grants; a worker transition program; and higher
       education assistance programs.

      Price Stabilization: The LEAF Act maintains the price stabilization program, which for
       decades has offered security to tobacco farmers at no net cost to the government. The
       tobacco program also places limits on the amount of tobacco grown in the United States,
       winning it support from key public health groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
       Kids.

      Optional Buyout: The bill gives farmers the option to have their quotas bought out.

In contrast to the LEAF Act, the alternative legislation sponsored by Senator Lugar, entitled the
Tobacco Transition Act, ends the quota program and fails to protect farmers adequately:

      Would Require Drastic Cuts in Health Spending: The proposal requires $18 billion to be
       paid to farmers over a three-year period (FY1999 through 2002). If this new spending is
       added and state spending is kept the same, the bill's spending on health research and
       public health programs would have to be cut by 69 percent in those three years to make
       up the difference.

      Increases the Amount of Tobacco Grown: Ifthere is no quota program, the amount of
       tobacco grown in the U.S. could increase dramatically. Maintenance of the tobacco
       quota program makes it possible to control the amount of tobacco grown in the United
       States. That is why public health groups, such as the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
       support maintaining a tobacco control program such as that advocated by Senators Ford
       and Hollings.

      Hurts Family Farms: Ending the quota program will destabilize prices and reduce
       margins, making it difficult for small farmers to survive. The bill will have a
       disproportionately adverse impact on minority farmers.

                            Advertising and Marketing to Children

By reaffinning the full authority ofthe FDA to regulate tobacco products, S.l415 will prevent the
tobacco industry from advertising and marketing to children, and establish tough access
restrictions on tobacco products to stop sales to children.

Reaffirms 1996 Rule: Many of the measures to reduce teen smoking and protect the public
health contained in S.1415 are in the 1996 FDA rule, but have not yet gone into effect because of
pending litigation. The bill would put these provisions into effect immediately, protecting
American children from the dangers of smoking. These provisions include: 1) banning outdoor
advertising within 1000 feet of schools and playgrounds; 2) restricting advertising to
black-and-white text only except in adult only facilities or publications with predominantly
adult readership; 3) prohibiting the sale or giveaway of promotional products with brand names
or logos; 4) prohibiting brand-name sponsorship of sporting or entertainment events; 5) setting.
the minimum age for purchase of tobacco products at 18 years and requiring age verification for
anyone age under 27.

Creates a Separate Chapter for Regulating Tobacco: S.1415 creates a separate chapter in the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that gives the FDA explicit authority over access to and
advertising of tobacco products, in order to ensure that FDA regulation of tobacco does not
impinge on the regulation of other products.

Establishes New Standard for Regulating Tobacco: Instead of requiring tobacco products to
meet the traditional safety and efficacy standard required of drugs and devices, S.1415 imposes a
new standard which would require FDA regulation of tobacco products to be "appropriate for the
protection of public health". This standard better meets the characteristics of tobacco products
and allows the FDA to take the addiction of over 40 million Americans into account in making
decisions about how to regulate these products.

Provides Necessary Flexibility: Full FDA authority to regulate tobacco products provides the
agency with the flexibility it needs to protect the public health. However, any FDA effort to
eliminate any particular class of tobacco products or eliminate nicotine cannot go into effect for
two years in order to 톚rovide Congress with an opportunity to weigh in and vote on the measure.

Preserves State and Local Authority: S.1415 makes clear that except as expressly provided,
states and localities may adopt and enforce tobacco product requirements that are in addition to,
or more stringent than, requirements established under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for
tobacco products.

Provides Full Enforcement Authority: S.1415 provides for the same civil and criminal penalties
that the agency may use in enforcing device law.

Summary of FDA Provisions in S.1415

     Overview of FDA Provisions: S. 1415 creates a separate chapter in the FDCA that
      explicitly gives FDA authority over access to and advertising of tobacco products. In
      nearly all respects this authority is comparable to the authority that FDA asserted in its
      1996 nile, which asserted FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products on the ground that
      nicotine is an addictive drug and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are
      combination drug/device products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
      (FDCA). S.1415, however, created a separate chapter in order to respond to concerns
      raised by medical device companies that tobacco statutory interpretations and other
      policies issued under the device provisions of the FDCA could adversely affect those
      companies.

      The most significant difference between S. 1415 and current law is the standard that
      products must meet in order to be marketed. Under current law the standard is
      "reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness." This standard obviously does not fit
      tobacco products because tobacco products are inherently unsafe. Therefore, S. 1414
      adopts the standard of "appropriate for the protection of the public health," which allows
      FDA to take into account the fact that over 40 million Americans are addicted to tobacco
      in making decisions about how to regulate the product.

     1996 FDA Tobacco Rule in Effect: S. 1415 provides that the tobacco regulation that
      FDA finalized in 1996 will remain in effect as though it were issued under the new law.
      Because the effective date of certain portions of the regulation has been delayed due to
      the industry's judicial challenge to the rule, the bill would authorize FDA to establish
      effective dates for those provisions not yet in effect.

     Access Restrictions: S. 1415 authorizes FDA to establish restrictions on the sale or
      distribution of tobacco products. By affirming the 1996 rule's access restrictions, the bill
      sets the minimum age of purchase at 18 years; requires age verification by photo ID for
      anyone 26 or younger; requires face-to-face sales (except for mail order sales); bans
      vending machines and self-service displays except in facilities where only adults are
      permitted; prohibits the sales of single cigarettes or "Ioosies"; bans free samples; and sets
      the minimum package size at 20 cigarettes. However, S. 1415 constrains FDA from
      prohibiting the sale of tobacco products in face-to-face transactions by specific categories
      of retail stores (such as a ban on sale of cigarettes by gas stations).

     Advertising Restrictions and Warning Labels: S. 1415 expressly authorizes FDA to
      establish restrictions related to the advertising and promotion of a tobacco product. By
      affirming the 1996 rule's advertising restrictions, the bill bans outdoor advertising within
      1000 feet of schools and public playgrounds; restricts advertising to black-and-white text
      only (publications, outdoor, point of purchase, direct mail, etc.), except in publications
      with a predominant adult readership or at adult only facilities; prohibits the sale or
      giveaways of products like caps or gym bags that carry cigarette or smokeless tobacco
      product brand names or logos; and prohibits brand-name sponsorship of sporting or
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion .

    entertainment events, but pennits it in the corporate name.

    S. 1415 also requires stronger and larger warning labels than existing law on tobacco
    products (to replace the "Surgeon General's warning"), and provides authority for FDA to
    modify the text, format, and type size requirements of these statements.

   Submission of Health Information to the Secretary: S. 1415 requires tobacco product
    manufacturers and importers, within 6 months of enactment (and annually thereafter), to
    submit to FDA specific categories of information relevant to FDA regulation of tobacco
    products.

   Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements: Authorizes FDA to issue regulations
    requiring that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the
    manufacture, of a tobacco product conform to good manufacturing practice (GMPs).
    The bill also makes explicit that the Secretary has the authority to grant either temporary
    or permanent exemptions or variances from a GMP requirement.

   Performance Standards: S. 1415 confirms FDA's authority to issue standards for
    tobacco for tobacco products (for example limiting the amount of certain ingredients) if
    FDA determines that a standard is appropriate for protection of the public health. This
    authority is the same as that for devices.

           In issuing a performance standard, FDA must consider the health effects on
           tobacco users as well as potential users (such as children).

           In order to give Congress a chance to vote on any standard that eliminates all
           cigarettes, all smokeless tobacco products, or any similar class of tobacco
           products, or requires the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero,
           such a standard will not go into effect until two years after the President has
           notified Congress of such a standard.

   Testing and Reporting of Tobacco Smoke Constituents: S. 1415 directs the Secretary
    to issue regulations to require the testing, reporting, and disclosure of tobacco smoke
    constituents (e.g., tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide) and ingredients that "the Secretary
    determines should be disclosed to the public in order to protect the public health."

   Reduced Risk Tobacco Products: S. 1415 contains a provision that allows FDA to
    designate a product as a "reduced risk tobacco product" if it finds that "the product will
    significantly reduce harm to individuals caused by a tobacco product and is otherwise
    appropriate to protect the public health."

   Preservation of State and Local Authority: S. 1415 makes clear that except as
    expressly provided, states and localities may adopt and enforce tobacco product
    requirements that are in addition to, or more stringent than, requirements established
    under FDCA for tobacco products.

           State and local requirements related to access and advertising are not preempted
           by the FDCA.

           State and local requirements related to performance standards, good
           manufacturing practices, and other similar FDCA requirements, are preempted,
           but States and localities may apply for exemptions pursuant to procedures that
           parallel provisions in device law.

           S.1415 modifies the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act in order to
           ensure that restrictions on advertising imposed under State laws are not
           preempted.

   Full Enforcement Authority: S. 1415 provides for the same civil and criminal penalties
    that the agency may use in enforcing the device law. The bill also provides that FDA may
    issue, after an administrative hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, a no tobacco
    sale order prohibiting the sale of tobacco products at a particular retail outlet based on
    repeated violations by that outlet. The bill also imposes the same requirements for the
    export of tobacco products that do not meet the requirements of the FDCA that apply to
    deviCes.
