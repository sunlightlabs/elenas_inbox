                                            San Bruno, California

1.    PURPOSE

      You will be announcing the final rule requiring public drinking water suppliers to
      provide customers with "consumer confidence reports." The rule will require
      56,000 water systems across the country to provide a total of 240 million Americans
      with annual reports on the source of their drinking water, contaminants found in
      their drinking water, the likely source of the contamination, the potential health
      impacts of contaminants detected, and other information.

      While California requires some form of disclosure, the EPA rule will establish
      standards that are clearly more protective (most notably by requiring information
      about the condition of drinking water sources and the sources of contamination),
      and will impose those standards nationally.

ll.   BACKGROUND

      The EPA rule you are announcing reflects two signature achievements of your
      Administration: repeated strengthening of community right-to-know about
      potential health and environmental threats, and landmark reforms to Federal
      drinking water laws to strengthen public health protection.

      Congress enacted the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 in the waning
      days of the 104th Congress. After a flurry of proposals and partisan debate in the
      104th Congress that would have substantially weakened drinking water protection,
      there emerged broad, bipartisan support for a bill that incorporated virtually the
      entire proposal for Safe Drinking Water Act reauthorization that you first
      presented to Congress in 1993. This legislation included provisions to:
      strengthened protection of drinking water sources, expanded community
      right-to-know about drinking water quality; creation of a new Safe Drinking Water
      State Revolving Fund to provide state and local governments with the resources to


                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
       and common-sense regulatory reforms (replacing highly prescriptive statutory
       requirements that EPA regulate a specified number of contaminants each year with
       science-based priority-setting, and providing greater regulatory flexibility for
       smaller water systems). The right-to-know requirements giving rise to this rule
       were among the last and most hard-fought provisions in the bill. The Senate
       narrowly defeated Senator Boxer's floor amendment to include these provisions,
       which were added only after a major debate on the House floor led by Congressman
       Henry Waxman (D-CA), the principal House proponent of the bill.

       You signed the bill into law on August 6,1996. Since enactment, the
       Administration has provided more than $2 billion in low-interest loans for
       improvements in local drinking water systems.

       EPA's rule implementing the right-to-know provision requires disclosure of a broad
       range of information intended, as is true for other right-to-know requirements, to
       prompt public attention and efforts to reduce potential risk even in the absence of
       regulation from a central bureaucracy. The rule is significant because, despite
       substantial progress in improving the quality of drinking water, communities
       continue to face public health threats linked to water quality problems.

       Last month, the parasite Cryptosporidium in drinking water infected 1,300
       residents of an Austin, Texas suburb. Also in July, E. coli infection of a public water
       supply in Alpine, Wyoming, sickened more than 50 people. The most deadly recent
       drinking water calamity in recent years was a 1993 outbreak of Cryptosporidium in
       Milwaukee's public drinking water supply, which resulted in 100 deaths and more
       than 400,000 illnesses. Note that while EPA's rule requires reporting of E. coli,
       standards for Cryptosporidium are still under development (EPA expects to
       announce them this fall). The rule does require reporting of turbidity, however,
       which is closely linked to outbreaks of Cryptosporidium.

       The "consumer confidence reports" will strengthen Americans' right to know about
       possible environmental and human health threats to drinking water in their
       community.

Regional Drinking Water Issue: MTBE

MTBE (Methyl Tertiary-Butyl Ether) is an automotive fuel additive, first introduced in the
late 1970s, that has been detected in groundwater and drinking water supplies in
California and other states, causing widespread public concern. For example, in Santa
Monica, MTBE contamination forced the closure of two major drinking water supplies in
1996. There has been no MTBE detected in San Francisco's water supplies.

On Thursday, August 6,1998, environmental groups filed suit in San Francisco against
eight major oil companies alleging negligence in the handling of MTBE. The suit seeks to
hold the companies liable for cleanup and damages.

MTBE contamination is primarily attributed to leaking underground storage tanks and
pipelines.
First introduced to enhance engine performance after the phase-out of lead in gasoline,
MTBE is currently added to gasoline as an oxygenate in order to reduce both carbon
monoxide and ozone levels. MTBE has been used in increasing quantities in recent years
to meet Clean Air Act requirements, especially in areas in nonattainment for carbon
monoxide and ozone. Thus, while there have been calls for an outright ban on MTBE
use, the air policy implications militate against such a ban in the absence of better scientific
support.

EPA has issued an advisory on MTBE and is assisting in investigating and responding to
cases ofMTBE contamination. In EPA's view, the MTBE levels that render drinking
water unacceptable as a matter of taste and odor are 100,000 times lower than the levels at
which there are human health effects. EPA does not have a regulatory standard for
MTBE in drinking water, although MTBE is a candidate for such a standard under the
1996 Safe Drinking Water Act amendments. Accordingly, MTBE levels need not be
monitored as part of EPA's new consumer confidence rule. California does require such
monitoring, however, and EPA's rule strongly encourages inclusion of this additional
information in the reports.

CalFed Bay-Delta Program

As the CALFed process moves toward closure, the stakeholders are becoming more
anxious about the outcome. Many urban water agencies are concerned that drinking
water quality may not be adequate to protect public health without a major new facility
("the peripheral canal") to export fresh water around the Delta, which supplies two-thirds
of the State's drinking water.

A study earlier this year suggested a connection between drinking water disinfectants and
miscarriages. This study will be evaluated as part of a broader strategy to determine what


                                                                  Automated Records Management Sys'em
                                                                          Hex·Dump Conversion     l
CALFED program will be implementing new programs to control polluted runoff affecting
drinking water sources, while maintaining the peripheral canal as a contingency strategy
for later stages of the program.

San Francisco Drinking Water Concerns

San Francisco gets 85 percent of its drinking water supplies from Yosemite National Park
and The Stanislaus National Forest. The ultimate source is snow melt in the Sierra
Mountains. The high quality of this drinking water source permitted EPA to grant a
filtration waiver to San Francisco in 1993. As reports of crypto sporidium and other
drinking water threats have become more prominent, there have been periodic concerns
about the appropriateness of the waiver. San Francisco's water continues to meet EPA's
criteria for filtration avoidance. Of the 50 contaminants monitored in this drinking water
supply last year, most were below minimum detection levels and all were well below EPA's
maximum contaminant levels (MCLs).

San Francisco Bay Area Smog Redesignation

On June 25,1998, EPA's Regional Administrator signed a final rule redesignating the San
Francisco Bay Area a non attainment area for Federal ozone standards under the Clean Air
Act. The determination will require additional air pollution controls in the area, and may
affect the level of funding the Bay Area can receive under the Congestion Mitigation and
Air Quality (CMAQ) programs under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century
(TEA-21). Several Bay Area Congressmen have urged EPA and DOT to interpret TEA-21
to avoid penalizing the Bay Area for having dirtier air, and the agencies are working to
resolve the issue.

Headwaters

There is currently a great deal of controversy concerning the State of California's proposed $130
million appropriations for its share of funds to purchase the Headwaters Forest. As you know,
we have obtained $250 million for the purchase of Headwaters, but the transaction cannot be
completed absent the State's share of the purchase. Spurred by environmentalists' concerns that
the proposed Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the lands that Pacific Lumber Co. would be
able to log is not protective enough, certain key California legislators, led by Byron Sher, have
been balking at appropriating the State's share. The situation was not helped by the company's
recent logging in an area contrary to recommendations of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
 Pacific Lumber Co. has now ceased that logging. Governor Wilson, Senator Feinstein and
Charles Hurwitz have been engaged in negotiations regarding possible further changes to the
HCP.

Press coverage on this indicates that the deal is about to fall apart. However, behind the scenes,
considerable progress is being made in terms of developing modifications to the agreement that
would make it acceptable to the California legislature and, hopefully, not unacceptable to


                                                                         Automated Records Management System

/
        PALCO. Until now, we have stayed one step removed from these negotiations, but are now
        getting engaged to try to bring them to a close in time for inclusion in the budget package being
        voted on Monday or Tuesday. The Vice President will be calling a key California legislator this
        weekend to urge a speedy conclusion.
