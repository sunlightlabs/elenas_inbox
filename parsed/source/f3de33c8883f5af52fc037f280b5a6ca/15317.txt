Questions and Answers on AmeriCorps:

Q:    Isn't it a disappointment to you that AmeriCorps, your signature program on
      service, is under constant fire from Congress, and has barely survived the past few
      years?

      A: I am very proud of AmeriCorps and what it is accomplishing in over 1,100
      communities across this country. Today, 25,000 AmeriCorps members are serving in
      over 1,100 communities cross America; 45,000 AmeriCorps alumni have already given a
      year of service to their country. The AmeriCorps program provides opportunity for those
      who are willing to shoulder responsibility for their community. In exchange for a year of
      full-time service, AmeriCorps members earn educational opportunity -- a $4,725
      scholarship that helps pay for college or training, or pay back student loans.

      National service is also a way of getting things done. For example, AmeriCorps has a
      key role to play in my America Reads initiative. Today, AmeriCorps members tutor
      children, serve as mentors for teens, renovate low-income housing, immunize children
      against preventable diseases, restore national parts and coastlines, and participate in
      hundreds of other service projects in the areas of education, public safety, and the
      environment.

      I am also proud of the Corporation for National Service's other service programs:

            Learn and Serve America promotes service as a way to learn through schools,
             universities, and community organizations. Young people of all ages learn from
             service activities such as teaching younger children to read, designing a
             neighborhood playground, or starting a school recycling program. Students who
             participate often 'earn higher grades and have a better understanding of their
             communities' needs.

            The National Senior Service Corps includes the Foster Grandparent Program,
             which matches seniors with children and youth with exceptional needs; the
             Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), where seniors tutor and mentor
             at-risk youth, teach English to immigrants, and organize neighborhood watch
             groups; and the Senior Companion Program, whose members help other seniors
             live independently.

      It is unfortunate that there have been partisan attacks on the program. However, more
      and more people are becoming aware of all that AmeriCorps members bring to a
      community, and I believe that the partisanship will give way to a recognition that this
      program works.

Q:   Isn't the cost per AmeriCorps member very high?

     A: The average cost per AmeriCorps member is about $17,000 -- but opponents of the
     program have often exaggerated that cost. These funds go for a modest living allowance,
     health coverage, some overhead, and most importantly, $4,725 for an education voucher
     upon completion of at least 1,700 hours of direct service. In addition, the Corporation
     for National Service has a plan to reduce that amount to $15,000 in the next two years.

     In addition, AmeriCorps is a cost effective program. One study showed that every
     federal dollar invested in AmeriCorps returns $2.60 in direct, measurable benefits.
     Finally, community groups that sponsor AmeriCorps members must raise at least
     one-third of the program costs -- and they do, from the largest corporations to local mom
     and pop hardware stores. Last year, AmeriCorps raised over $41 million from the
     private sector -- from companies that know a good return on investment when they see it.
      They raised another $50 million in funding and in-kind contributions from state and
     local agencies like schools, police departments, and health facilities.

     AmeriCorps is a wise investment that pays off for taxpayers in three ways:

           Direct service benefits communities in tangible ways such as improved math
            scores, restored natural resources, safer streets, and immunized infants

           Education awards help pay for college or pay back loans ... not with a grant, an
            entitlement, or a gift from the government, but because the AmeriCorps Member
            earned it by producing substantial results for his or her community

           Skills learned and the civic ethic developed through service generates a lifetime of
            benefits from productive, better educated citizens with a life-long dedication to
            service. Recognizing this, the Civic Forum (which includes Vin Weber and
            communitarian academic Amitai Etzioni) gave the 20,000 Members of
            AmeriCorps its first-ever Exemplary Civic Achievement Award.

Q:   Doesn't AmeriCorps hurt the charitable sector and the volunteer ethic by displacing
     local charities? Don't AmeriCorps members' living allowances and education
     awards discourage uncompensated volunteering?

     A: AmeriCorps is a welcomed resource for charities and a nucleus for uncompensated
     volunteers. Voluntary organizations proudly participate in AmeriCorps, including Habitat
     for Humanity, scores of United Ways and YMCAs, the National Council of Churches,
     the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the American Red Cross.

     That's because AmeriCorps members extend the reach of volunteers. They provide
     intensive, long-term relief following floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters; keep
     services running during the low-volunteer hours of a working day; and organize
     community-wide efforts in which more volunteers can participate, such as river

      AmeriCorps members bring more volunteers to the community. Last year, Volunteer
      Maryland's 55 AmeriCorps members recruited and engaged 7,500 volunteers who
      provided services valued at over $4 million. For every AmeriCorps Member in Magic
      Me, there are at least 100 volunteers engaged in weekly service. AmeriCorps-led
      projects such as community-wide service days or volunteer management programs make
      it easy and attractive for citizens who want to participate in an occasional, but
      meaningful, volunteer experience.

      AmeriCorps members provide full-time service like Peace Corps Volunteers or members
      of the all-volunteer armed forces. Like them -- and like past national service
      participants such as the veterans of the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps
      -- AmeriCorps members earn a living allowance, and just like the others, they
      accomplish far more than sporadic volunteer efforts.

      Finally, AmeriCorps moves decision-making out of Washington. Two-thirds of
      AmeriCorps funds go directly to the states to support locally designed and operated
      programs. AmeriCorps programs are managed by bi-partisan state commissions whose
      members are appointed by each Governor.

Q:     How could your AmeriCorps program allow one of its regional directors, Michael
       Woo, to use an AmeriCorps fax machine and letterhead to try to arrange a meeting
       between Indonesian-American business owners and Commerce Department
       officials, in coordination with John Huang, according to documents provided by the
     . Democratic National Committee?

      A: Corporation for National Service CEO Harris Wofford has stated: "The simple facts
      are: an unauthorized letter on Corporation stationary dated August 1, 1996, came to our
      attention on April 15, 1997. On April 17th, 1997, Senator Grassley and Representative
      Hoekstra sent a letter to me requesting information about this unauthorized letter. I
      responded immediately .... The Inspector General and Department of Justice have been
      asked to investigate, and I therefore cannot comment further.

      "From day one, my policy has been that no Corporation employee may participate in
      political activity while on the job or otherwise holding himself or herself out as a
      Corporation employee. And I have gone all out to make sure that AmeriCorps members,
      the local project directors who select members, and administer Corporation-assisted
      service programs, and the state executive directors of the governors' state service
      commissions understand their duty to enforce strict guidelines against partisan political
      activity. I have enforced this policy vigorously.

      "I have asked the Inspector General to ascertain whether my strict policies about political
      activity are being adhered to and to work with me on steps to make sure that no violations
      occur.
                                       Hex-Dwr.p Conversion


        "The issues raised ... are deeply troubling to me. I am proud of the staff of the
        Corporation and the 25,000 AmeriCorps members serving their communities, who adhere
        to our strict policy about partisan activity."
