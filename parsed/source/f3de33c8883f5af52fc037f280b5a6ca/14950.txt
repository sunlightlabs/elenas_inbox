                     TALKING POINTS FOR MR. BOWLES
                 REGARDING PRODUCT LIABILITY LEGISLATION

    Likely purpose of Congressman Dingell's call to you: To propose that Hill staff and
    Administration staff set up a working group to engage in substantive discussions on product
    liability legislation.

    Mr. Dingell is a proponent of product liability reform. He voted for the bill that came to the
    President last year and to override the President's veto.

    Bottom line for Mr. Bowles to know: OurNECIDPC/Counsel's Office policy process,
    working with Legislative Affairs, is about to send a memo to the President to see where he now
    is and how he wants to proceed on this subject. Until that happens, we do not know whether
    committing to the formal working group process that Mr. Dingelllikely will propose would serve
    our goals. Nevertheless, it will be hard for us to say that we will not discuss the issue. Thus, in
    this conversation, the desired outcome would be to agree in principle to talk without locking
    into a particular process.

    General talking points:

          As you know, last year the President vetoed the product liability bill (H.R. 956) because
           of several concerns. For example:

                  First, it wholly eliminated joint and several liability for noneconomic
                   damages. The President did not agree that it was okay for the injured consumer
                   to be left holding the bag when one of the parties responsible for the injury could
                   not pay.

                  Second, the President opposed the idea of arbitrarily capping punitive damages.

          More broadly, the bill would have interfered in an area of traditional state responsibility
           in a way that would have disadvantaged consumers -- it preempted state laws, but only
           when the state law would have given consumers more favorable treatment when
           suing to vindicate their rights. This kind of picking and choosing amounts to a one-way
           street of federalism, and the President was very concerned about whether that was fair.

          From the President's perspective, there are a lot of things -- some ofthem quite
           fundamental -- that would need to be fixed to overcome these concerns.

          Nevertheless, we would want to engage on the legislation to explore whether these things
           could be fixed. We are too early in the process to have a fully formed view about
           whether that's possible; it's too early, even, to say whether we are pessimistic or
           optimistic.                                                           Prepared by WaDman 3120/97
