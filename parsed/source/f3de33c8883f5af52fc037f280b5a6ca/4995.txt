TEXT:
As the attached document shows, we've made good progress on our issues in
the TANF reg negotiations so far.  There are about 8-10 issues that still
need to be resolved.

But first, we need as soon as possible to decide our position on waivers.
Please review the new option described in the attached, which is designed
to try to narrow the scope of the provision without rendering it
meaningless (not an easy task, we've found).

Is it possible for us to meet this afternoon to discuss the waiver issue
specifically? HHS is awaiting our position on this issue. We'd also be
happy to discuss any of the other issues.

OMB's plan for the next step in the negotiation is for Sally Katzen to
host an OMB-HHS-DPC meeting to try to settle the unresolved issues.


Please review the chart in preparation for a meeting to be scheduled and

                                         Waiver Policy Proposal
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
I. STATUTE
     "Waivers in Effect on Date of Enactment of Welfare Reform": " ... if any waiver granted to a
     state .. .is in effect as ofthe date of enactment.... , the amendments made by [PRWORA]. .. shall not
     apply with respect to the state before the expiration (determined without regard to any extension)
     of the waiver to the extent such amendments are inconsistent with the waiver."

       "Waivers Approved Subsequently" section says that such a waiver "shall not affect the
       applicability of section 407 to the state." (Work requirements)

       Legislative History: statutory language was narrowed from 'if have a waiver, new law does not
       apply' to "inconsistent" standard. Final report language added clause re: "program features of
       state program not specifically covered by the waiver must conform to this part."

II. DDS PROPOSED REG
Legal Theory:
A provision ofTANF is inconsistent with a waiver only if the State must change its waiver policy in order
to comply. The definition of a waiver can include applicable provisions of prior law if their inclusion
was necessary to achieve the objective of the approved waiver. For example, a state whose waiver .
program counted community college attendance as work did not need a waiver of AFDC law in order to
do this. The reg would permit such a practice to continue, because it would require a change in state
policy to do otherwise, and it's inconsistent with T ANF's definition of work. Legally, the reg defends the
decision to consider prior law as part of the waiver on the grounds that doing otherwise would allow very
few waiver practices to continue (largely just time limits), rendering that section of the law meaningless.

Policy Effect:
Work Requirements:
Section 407 doesn't apply to waivers to the extent their features are inconsistent with current law.
Examples given are looser definitions of work and requiring fewer hours of work per week to be counted
as working. However, states may not claim inconsistencies that affect the denominator of the
participation rates -- i.e., limit the universe of people to whom the participation rates are applied. The
reg dcfends this decision by noting that HHS never granted a waiver of a participation rate, nor a waiver
that granted new exemptions from work requirements.

Time Limits:
States whose waivers have time limits may use their waiver's more liberal exemption and extension
policies.

      Extensions -- The draft reg says that both the federal and state clocks must start ticking
       simultaneously but that, once the federal clock expires, the state may grant extensions in
       accordance with the approved waiver until the waiver expires. The reg al~o says that a state need
       not comply with the law's 20% limit on exemptions if its waiver's extension policies cause it to
       exceed 20%.

      Exemptions -- The draft reg also says that months during which a recipient is exempt from time
       limits because of waiver policy do not count toward the federal five-year limit.



                                                   -1-
                                                                           Hex-Dump C;:onversipn
The Challenge: To define "inconsistent" in a way that narrows the effect ofthe provIsIOn WIthOut
rendering the entire provision meaningless.

Work Requirements:
     Argue that definitions of work activity were not necessary to achieve objective of approved waiver
      (objective was to put more people to work)-- thus no grandfathering of more liberal job search and
      voc ed criteria.

      Altemative argument with the same result: Only permit specific items waived from compliance
       with prior law, rather than allowing states to import "provisions of prior law" into the definition of
       waiver. In this case, the definition of work in any waiver could not be inconsistent with the law,
       because in no case was the definition of work activities a "program feature ... specifically covered
       by the waiver". Thus more liberal definitions of job search and vocational education could not
       be continued under the guise of waivers. [This theory may not, however, allow the policy listed in
       next bullet below; thus it may result in the provision having no effect on work rates, which HHS
       argues it must since the statute specifically exempts "waivers granted subsequently" from having
       any effect on work rates.]

      Allow, as the draft reg now does, for waivers to be considered inconsistent if they specified the
       number of hours of work to be determined according to individual circumstances, but make
       explicit that these inconsistent waivers can only be continued in the same geographic areas as
       originally approved in the waiver and in effect at date of enactment [i.e., if a state had approval to
       expand a waiver statewide but had not done so yet, it could not].

Time Limits:
     Allow, as the draft reg now does, for exemption and extension policies to be considered
      inconsistent, but make explicit that these waivers can only be continued in the same geographic
      areas as originally approved in the waiver and in effect at date of enactment [i.e., if a state had
      approval to expand a waiver statewide but had not done so yet, it could not].

Changes Applying to Both Work Requirements and Time Limits:

      A state that continues a waiver inconsistent with PRWORA's time limits or work requirements
       shall not be eligible for a high performance bonus or a caseload reduction credit.

      A state that continues a waiver inconsistent with PRWORA's time lImits or work requirements
       shall not be eligible to receive a reasonable cause penalty exception, to enter into a corrective
       action plan, or receive reduced penalties.

      In order to continue a waiver inconsistent with PRWORA's time limits or work requirements, the
       state must notify the Secretary in writing in a letter signed by the governor.

      The regulation shall place the burden of proof that waivers are inconsistent with the law on the
       state and must collect information necessary for the Secretary to make that determination.

PENALTIES


           2  The reg now refers more generally to excluding "procedural changes that have the
   effect of delaying or denying eligibility" but HHS policy would be to tell. states that caseload
   changes from fingerprinting, etc., should count in that category. This HHS policy could help
   prevent states from gutting the work requirements: by not allowing a state to claim a caseload
   credit for caseload reductions due to fingerprinting (up to 15% in some states) the policy could
   prevent a state from lowering its work rate from, say, 50% to 35%.

           3  The reg eliminates these cases from both comparison years, thus making more of an
   "apples to apples" comparison. For purposes of calCulating the caseload credit, the TANF +
   MOE caseload not receiving short-term or non-monetary assistance in a given year is compared
   to the FY 1995 AFDC caseload without any short-time Emergency Assistance cases. The policy
  .effect of this definition is that states that shift their services from monthly cash grants to either
   non-monetary services or one-time diversion grants will receive higher caseload credits.

2) States may not retrospectively                  X

           4    HHS has made the following changes: in order to be eligible for a reasonable cause
   penalty exception or a reduced penalty based on degree of non-compliance, a state must prove
   that it did not divert families to a separate state program for the purpose of avoiding work
   participation rates.

           5  HHS has not agreed to make the following changes: 1) in order to enter into corrective
   compliance plan or receive a reduction in penalties ("some or all") for not correcting a failure
   through such a plan, a state must prove. that it did not divert families to a separate state program
   for the purpose of avoiding work participation rates; 2) condition a state's eligibility for any of
   the penalty exceptions/reductions on the state proving that it did not divert families in order to
   prevent the federal collection of child support; and 3) to collect data that will help determine if
   states are diverting individuals to separate state programs (include in the MOE data report
   information on whether individuals served in the separate state program were on TANF within
   the last six months).

    on degree of noncompliance with the

    6) Eliminate the option for the Secretary                                               XIO

       argument that the statute allows states up to two months to complete and file the plan, so in
       reality the compliance plan is in effect for 10 months. A six month time limit would give states
       only four months to comply.

                 8 HHS has agreed to a sliding scale as follows: only states that met at least 75 percent of
        the work participation rate (e.g., 75% of 30% or 22.5%) would be eligible for a sliding penalty
        based on degree of non-cOmpliance. All states falling below that standard will receive the full
        penalty. If a state failed both the overall and the two parent work rates, then its penalty would
       be reduced in direct proportion to the level of achievement above the 75 percent threshold (e.g.,
        if a state were halfway between 22.5% and 30%, its penalty would be reduced in half}. If a state
      . failed only the two parent rate, its penalty would be first be multiplied by 10 percent and then
        reduced in direct proportion to the level of achievement above the 75 percent threshold.

              9 We proposed that the threshold be rai:sed from 75 percent to 90 percent -- only states
       meeting a 90 percent of the work participation rate would be eligible for a sliding penalty based
       on degree of non-compliance. HHS has objected to this change.

               10HHS has proposed only minor word changes to this section, such as adding "expended
       significantly more resouces", made "substantial progress", and "encountered overriding
       cirumstances that were beyond its control and could not have been anticipated."
