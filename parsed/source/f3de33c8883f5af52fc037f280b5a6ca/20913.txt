                       INS Naturalization -- Backlog Reduction Strategy
                                        August 3, 1998

Background

Many immigration advocates have expressed serious concerns over the naturalization backlog
and INS' proposed immigration service fee increases -- primarily for naturalization. The
dramatic increase in naturalization applications (from 540,000 in FY 1994 to almost 1.6 million
in FY 1997), along with a greater focus on the integrity rather than the speed of the naturalization
process, has resulted in an increase in the number of pending applications. As of the end of May
1998, nearly 1.9 million applications were pending. Currently, most applicants are experiencing
a wait of 18-24 months.

Talking Points

      I agree that the growing backlog is unacceptable. My Administration is committed to
       both management reforms and providing the resources necessary to reduce waiting times.
       In the past year, the INS has implemented several reforms to the naturalization process
       that are designed to expedite processing, while maintaining integrity. We recognize,
       however, that INS's efforts to date represent just the first steps in a long road -- enormous
       challenges lie ahead, and we are committed to meeting those challenges expeditiously.

      We are working with the caucus to develop a new plan with INS to meet the backlog
       reduction targets outlined in the Budget. The plan will provide INS with the means
       to reduce the backlog and improve customer service. The plan will include a
       package of management reforms and process reengineering improvements. These
       changes will be implemented over the next few months.

NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS NOT FOR RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC

The Hispanic Caucus is very concerned about the backlog and the Administration's plan to
increase the naturalization fee, which funds the naturalization program. We have
developed the following proposed plan to address the INS backlog and delay the
naturalization fee increase (we will go forward with the other fee increases on schedule).
The plan has been discussed with Congressman Becerra and agrees that we should not
announce the plan at this time. The House is currently considering the Commerce,
Justice, State appropriations bill, and announcement of this plan may jeopardize the
funding for this initiative.

The proposed plan would

                provide an additional $171 million in FY1999 dedicated to reduce the
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

                     backlog;

                    implement management improvements by establishing a new Deputy
                     Executive Associate Commissioner for Immigration Services who will focus
                     exclusively on benefits service delivery with a mandate to reduce the
                     naturalization backlog, continue reengineering of adjudications processes, and
                     improve customer service;

                    establish backlog reduction teams comprised of adjudicators dedicated to
                     naturalization application processing. The teams will be concentrated in the
                     five cities that represent 65% of the backlog -- Los Angeles, San Francisco,
                     New York, Miami, and Chicago.

                    implement reenginering improvements (recommended by Price Waterhouse
                     Coopers) including implementing a comprehensive national phone center,
                     consolidating medical waiver and complete file review at service centers, and
                     implementing the Guide to Naturalization ensuring standard procedures
                     across the agency.

                    implement the naturalization fee increase, including a fee waiver policy,
                     effective January 1, 1999. All other immigration services fee increases will be
                     effective in October, 1998, to better reflect the true cost of immigration
                     services.

             Congressman Becerra and we believe that we must announce all the pieces of this plan
      together in an effort to protect funding and prevent Republican (Chairman Rogers) opposition.
      Therefore, we will wait and announce the plan later this week.
