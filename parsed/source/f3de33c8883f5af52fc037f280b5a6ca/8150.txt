MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed, Charles   F.e. Ruff

SUBJECT:      Hyde Amendment Application to Medicare and Abortion Coverage Requirements
              for Catholic Provider Sponsored Organizations


As you know, some women of child-bearing age qualify for Medicare because they receive
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). Senator Nickles has asked HHS whether the Hyde
Amendment's restrictions on government funding of abortion apply to the Medicare program.
He also has asked whether health plans that refuse, on religious grounds, to provide abortion
services can still become Provider Sponsored Organizations (PSOs).

We believe that we must respond quickly to Senator Nickles to have any chance of avoiding
another legislative confrontation over abortion policy. This memo provides background
information and policy options for your consideration.

Background

Earlier this year, the Catholic Health Association (CHA) contacte~ HHS and the White House
about a ruling by a HCFA regional office that a Catholic-run PSO could participate in Medicare
only if it agreed to cover qualified abortions for women with disabilities. The CHA vehemently
objected to this ruling and asked if we could intervene administratively. At the same time, the
CHA contacted Senator Nickles' office. The CHA discussed with Nickles both whether the
Hyde Amendment applies to Medicare and whether Catholic PSOs can decline to provide all
abortions (even those permitted under Hyde). The Senator, clearly sensing another abortion
wedge issue, wrote to Donna Shalala to obtain the Department's formal position on both of these
Issues.

Medicare and Abortion coverage.   Five million non-elderly disabled Americans -- including two
million women -- receive Medicare coverage by virtue of their SSDI eligibility. The Medicare
program currently covers about 500 abortions each year, while denying claims in another
100-200 cases. These figures are consistent with those from the Reagan and Bush
Administrations.

In 1991, HCFA issued a reimbursement directive stating that Medicare would cover abortion
                                                                                           ........ ..~




                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

services only in cases where the life of the mother was endangered. (Prior to this time, there
was no clear guidance on the subject.) This directive, which comported with the then-existing
Hyde Amendment, is actually more restrictive than the current Hyde amendment, because it fails
to cover abortions arising from rape and incest. The directive, however, has not been modified,
and remains the only policy guidance on abortion coverage under the Medicare program.

Although we believe that most Medicare carrier medical directors have largely complied with this
directive, some may have covered other kinds of abortions -- ~, abortions arising from rape or
incest, abortions involving deformed fetuses, or other medically necessary abortions. In
particular, carriers may have decided to cover some very difficult cases involving the one-third of
women on Medicare disability who have some serious mental impairment (about 700,000
women). Such individual coverage decisions may help explain why no one on the pro-choice
side of the abortion debate has ever complained about our coverage policy.

Legislative and Political Environment    The Nickles' letter has started yet another controversial
abortion debate. The CHA is working with Senator Nickles and others on drafting legislation
to make clear that Hyde applies to Medicare, as well as to exempt organizations with ethical or
religious scruples from any abortion coverage requirements. (CHA and Nickles have gotten the
impression from HHS that Hyde does not apply to Medicare and that the religious convictions
of Catholic PSOs cannot be fully accommodated.) Absent administrative action, there is no doubt
that we will see this issue raised on some appropriations bill. At the same time, the womens'
groups have been tipped off to this issue and are urging the Administration to adopt a generous
Medicare abortion coverage policy.

Options to Respond to the CHA and Senator Nickles. All of your advisors (HHS, OMB, and
DPC) agree that we should offer the CHA a new administrative option that allows Catholic
health plans to participate in Medicare without covering any abortions, so long as they accept a
slightly reduced capitated payment. We do not know whether CHA will accept this offer, but
think it may do so, particularly if the offer is combined with CHA's preferred outcome on the
Hyde issue.

The outstanding question is whether Hyde applies to Medicare. Since the "life of the mother"
interpretation contained in the most recent guidance is more restrictive than the current Hyde
amendment, we all agree that the guidance should be modified to cover at least abortions arising
from rape and incest. We have not reached consensus, however, on whether we should also
cover any other abortions (i.e., any abortions that Hyde generally bars from federal funding).
We see two viable options:




Option 1:      Rule that the current Hyde Amendment (allowing funding where the life of the

                                                2
                                                                                            b'"
                                                                                                      "1"/

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

            woman is in danger or in cases of rape and incest) applies to Medicare.Under this
            option; we would take the position that since some Hyde-covered appropriated
            funds are deposited into the Medicare Trust Fund, all Medicare expenditures must
            abide by the Hyde restrictions. We then would update our Medicare coverage
            policy to reflect the current, comparatively expansive Hyde Amendment. This
            position is supported by OMB and DPC.

            Pros:

                   This option is most likely to avoid a legislative showdown on abortion
                    funding issue we are unlikely to win.

                   This option is consistent with our current position on Medicaid funding.

                   This option increases our ability to reach an agreement with the CHA on
                    the PSO abortion coverage issue.

            Cons:

                   This option may reduce the number of abortions covered (assuming some
                    carriers are simply ignoring the current reimbursement directive, but will
                    have to comply with an updated directive) and expose us to criticism about
                    non-coverage of extremely' sympathetic cases involving vulnerable and
                    disabled women.

                   This option will anger womens' groups, which would prefer us to provide
                    Medicare coverage of the widest possible range of abortions, even if doing
                    so would provoke the Republicans to enact contrary legislation.


Option 2:   Rule that Medicare can cover abortions necessary to protect the health of the woman
            (in addition to abortions allowed by Hyde) by segregating appropriated funds from
            non-appropriated funds (payroll tax, premiums, etc.) in the Medicare Trust Fund and
            using the non-appropriated (and hence unrestricted) funds to pay for the health-related
            abortions.

            Pros:

                   This option will ensure that all abortions necessary to protect a woman's
                    health are covered, and thereby avoid criticism arising from non-coverage


                                              3
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

                       of highly sympathetic cases involving vulnerable and disabled women.

                      This option will assuage the womens' groups by providing for Medicare
                       coverage of a larger class of abortions.

               Cons:

                      This option will virtually guarantee a legislative battle with Senator Nickles
                       and his allies on the appropriateness of using public funds to pay for
                       abortions. (This fight is not worthwhile unless we are willing to engage
                       in a veto strategy.)

                      This option might well undermine our ability to reach agreement with the
                       CHA on the PSO abortion coverage issue.


At this time, HHS opposes both of these options. HHS supports covering abortions necessary
to protect health (as in option 2), but wants to do so without separating appropriated from
unappropriated monies in the Medicare Trust Fund. HHS argues that no such segregation is
needed to escape restrictions on appropriated funds when these funds have been commingled
with non-appropriated monies.

White House Counsel, OMB and Justice believe the HHS approach raises serious legal
questions. OMB takes the position that HHS must segregate funds in the Trust Fund in order
to expend any non-appropriated funds in ways not allowed by Hyde. White House Counsel
and the Justice Department believe that HHS needs to defer to OMB's direction. Therefore, we
believe it would be inappropriate to forward the HHS option. We believe you should be
aware, however, that the Secretary opposes both of the options we are providing.

As noted, DPC and OMB support Option 1, because (1) it is most consistent with this
Administration's prior practice on government funding of abortions and (2) it stands the best
chance of avoiding a high-profile legislative battle on both the Hyde and PSO issues that we are
unlikely to win. Counsel's Office takes no position as between the two legal options presented
above.
