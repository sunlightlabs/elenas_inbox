        Acknowledgments and Introduction. [tk]


        I am not ordinarily the Administration's spokesperson on issues
like tobacco. But I am here today, not only as the Chief of Staff of this
Administration, but as a businessman, as a North Carolinian, and as a
parent, to talk to you about the President's plan to protect our children
from tobacco.


        Consider these facts:


               Smoking kills 430,000 people ever year -- it kills more people
                than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and
                fires combined. Smoking is still by far the largest preventable
                cause of premature death in the United States.


               Nearly 90% of smokers started smoking before they turned 18.

                                          -1-
          years after starting -- yet only one in five actually manages to quit.


         Every day, 3,000 young people will become regular smokers, and
           1,000 will die sooner as a result.


     At the same time, multi-million dollar marketing campaigns have
been designed to get our children to light their first cigarettes.


         In the past months, new documents have come to light that
           conclusively prove that tobacco companies aimed to sell their
           deadly products to children as young as 12.


          These documents are a shocking reminder that our children are
          under siege by a deadly and powerful enemy -- and it is up to us to
           protect our children.

threat of tobacco is threat is one of President Clinton's top goals,;,- and this
administration is fully committed to working with the bipartisan
leadership in Congress to achieve this goal.


          This is not a matter of politics --- it is a matter of priorities. Many
           Members of Congress from both parties have shown enormous
           leadership on this most important issue.


          Congressman Waxman has been in the forefront of this issue for
           years -- providing the powerful leadership it took to bring us to the
           pivotal point have reached today.


          Congressman Bliley has recently done the American people a great
           service by getting thousands of pages of documents from the
           tobacco companies posted on the Internet for all the world to see
           how tobacco companies have gone after our children.

    worked long and hard to introduce tobacco legislation that this
    Administration can support.


   Senator McCain [and Senator Hollings] has/have provided great
    leadership in the Commerce Committee to put together a bipartisan
    bill that embodies the President's principals.


   We will not let protecting our children's lives become an election
    year political fight. It must be a national commitment.

-- and experience shows -- is the best way to stop young Americans from
smoking before they start. His plan would:


         Raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten
          years;


         Affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;


         Impose strict restrictions on advertising aimed at young people; and


         Assess stiff penalties for selling cigarettes to minors.

stop teenage smoking will save 1 million lives over the next five years.


         Last week, Vice President Gore announced that new estimates show
           that our proposal would have major effects on youth smoking in
          every state, with reductions ranging from 33% in Washington State
          to 51 % in Kentucky.


         For every dime added to the price of cigarettes, up to 700,000 fewer
          teenagers will begin smoking and more than 200,000 premature
          deaths will be avoided.


         The combination of the price increase called for in the President's
          plan plus the tighter restrictions on youth access and marketing, will
          reduce teen smoking by 1.6 In 2003 -- a 42% reduction and a total
          of 3 million fewer smokers over the next 5 years.

    As the President has said, advertising aimed at adults is legal, but
     tobacco companies must draw the line at our children.


    Our proposal requires tobacco companies to help establish
     smoking cessation programs for adult smokers, and to launch
     public education campaigns aimed at children to keep them from
     smoking in the first place.

is tragic -- and as a businessman, I can tell you that the economic cost to
our society is extremely high.


          Smoking related illness costs approximately $60 Billion every
           year -- that's more than the federal government spends on
           education, child care, and medical research combined.


          Smoking during pregnancy results in 2,500 fetal deaths every
          year, and costs $4 billion every year -- which is close to double
           what we spend on cancer research each year.


         Fires caused by smokers cost another $500 Million every year;


          Smokers die earlier and retire sooner -- and this is estimated to
           cost our economy as much as $80 Billion every year in lost
          output, lost productivity, and lost wages.

their hard-earned tax dollars. But if we pass the President's plan, we will
take the first important steps to reducing these costs, increasing productivity,
and most important, saving lives.


     We know that this plan will be good for America -- but as a North
Carolinian born and raised in tobacco country, I can tell you that we
must also make sure that we treat our tobacco farmers fairly.


          The President has made protecting tobacco farmers and their
           communities one of the five key elements for his plan for
           comprehensive tobacco legislation.

    public and protecting the well-being of farming communities.
    Recently, a remarkable coalition of farming groups, including
    burley and flue-cured growers, and public health              gr~ups,

    including the American Heart Association and the American
    Cancer Society, came together around a shared set of
    principles. That is a consensus we can build on.


   We will use some of the revenue from raising the price of
    cigarettes to make sure that we save our kids without
    devastating our farm communities.                 That is a commitment
    this Administration has made, and we are optimistic that a
    consensus is forming in Congress to use some of this money to
    help tobacco farmers.

harms of tobacco -- and our nation from the burdensome costs
associated with teen smoking.           And this budget!!.lli the very money
raised by raising the price of cigarettes to invest in the future of our
nation. Our budget uses the tobacco money for:

          Critical investments in health research, including biomedical
           research, cancer clinical trials, and children's health outreach --
           increasing by nearly 50% funding at the National Institutes of Health.


          We also make historic investments in child care and after-school care
            -- doubling the number of working families who receive child care,
           for a total of 2 million children; and increasing the number of
           students receiving after school care by 500,000 per year; and lastly,


          We make unprecedented investments in education -- reducing class
           size, hiring 100,000 more teachers, building or rehabilitating 5,000
           more schools;

that when I hear the statistics I mentioned earlier, my blood runs cold.


         And when I hear that tobacco companies have deliberately tried to
          get our children to smoke -- despite the fact that a full third of the
          3,000 kids who start smoking every day will die prematurely -- I
          know that we must not rest until we have done everything we can
          to protect our children from tobacco.

     We have it within our power right now to save the lives of 1 million kids
over the next five years. We must not miss this historic opportunity.


         As President Clinton recently said: "We stand on the verge of one
          of the greatest public health achievements in history -- an historic
          triumph in our fight to protect America's children from the deadly
          threat of tobacco."




         As Chief of Staff of this Administration, as a businessman, as a
          North Carolinian, as a parent, and as an American -- I ask you to
          support our efforts, and to work with us in a bipartisan manner to
          meet this vitally important challenge.


     Thank you.
