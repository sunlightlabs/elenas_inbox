        RECONCILIATION ITEMS THAT WEAKEN WORK REQUIREMENTS

I. FLSAIMinimum Wage
      Work Activities Pennitted -- The House proposal would allow states whose benefits
       levels don't support the minimum wage for the required number of hours to count work
       activities that current law does not pennit them to count.

       To get up to 20 hours a week, states could count any of the following activities, none of
       which count under current law:
       (1)    job skills training directly related to employment;
       (2)    education for those with no high school diploma;
       (3)    job search and job readiness assistance in excess of6 weeks (current law: the
              first 6 weeks always count as work); and
       (4)    vocational educational training in excess of 12 months (current law: the first 12
              months always count as work).

       To go from 20 to 30 hours a week, states could count any items from this same list of
       activities; but current law already pennits 'activities (1) and (2) to count for hours over 20.

      Deducting child support retained by the state -- In defining the maximum number of
       hours of workfare participation per month, the House bill deducts child support retained
       by the state from welfare and food stamp benefits before dividing by the minimum wage.
       This is intended to prevent women from having to "work off' their own child support, but
       it raises a number of difficult fairness questions.

Special Note on Nickles Amendment -- This amendment is intended to ameliorate one
consequence of the Labor Department's minimum wage guidance. Applying either to current
law or to the House bill, it says that regardless of minimum wage requirements, states may issue
sanctions against recipients. The question is whether current law already pennits this, and DOL
and HHS are investigating this question. For example, it may be that sanctions can be viewed as
"wage garnishments" deducted after payment of the minimum wage.

One easy solution that the agencies may offer is to allow a sanction to be imposed, but at the
same time to cut the hours of work required. We have to decide if that solution is unacceptable
to us. We have taken no position on the Nickles amendment to date.

II. 20% Vocational Education Limit
     Current law is arguably somewhat murky on this issue. It says that "not more than 20%
      of individuals in all families ... may be detennined to be engaged in work" because of
      vocational education or high school attendance by teen parents. The liberal
      interpretation (which the Education Department urged us to embrace publicly without
      success) is that the cap is 20% of the entire caseload. The conservative interpretation is
      that the cap is 20% of those engaged in work. Therefore, measuring whether the
      reconciliation proposals weaken the work requirement depends on what interpretation
      you start with.
                                                Hex-Dump Conversion 

       Since teen parents attending high school "share" the 20% cap with vocational education,
       and teen parents are 6% of current caseload, many argue that this leaves little or no room
       for vocational education. (According to CRS, one-third of teen parents have diplomas,
       so teen parents attending high school are 4% of current caseload -- or less, since many
       don't actually attend school.)

       The proposals vary widely in terms of the percent of the caseload that can be in
       vocational education and still count as working -- from 2% to 20%.

      Percent of Caseload that can be in vocational education and count as working:
       House Education and Workforce (strict interpretation of current law):
            FY98: 20% cap applied to the 30% required to work = 6%; less 4% teen parents = 2%
            FY02: 20% cap applied to the 50% required to work = 10%; less 4% teen parents = 6%

       House Ways and Means (strict interpretation, but increase cap to 30% and take out teens):
            FY98: 30% cap applied to the 30% required to work = 9%
            FY02: 30% cap applied to the 50% required to work = 15%

       Liberal Interpretation of Current Law (20% of total case1oad, teens part of cap):
              FY98: 20% cap applied to total case1oad, less 4% teen parents = 16%
              FY02: same = 16%

       Senate (liberal interpretation, plus take out teens):
             FY98: 20%
             FY02: 20%

III. Domestic Violence Exemption
This Senate amendment would allow states to grant waivers from the 5-year time limit for
victims of domestic violence in excess of the 20% cap now in the law. In addition, it would
require HHS to exclude recipients with such waivers in computing state work participation rates
and penalties.

The House has no such provision. We have not yet taken any position on this amendment.

      Current Law -- States may exempt up to 20% of the monthly case10ad from the 5-year
       time limit for reasons of hardship "or if the family includes an individual who has been
       battered or subjected to extreme cruelty."

       In addition, states have an option to certifY that they have and enforce standards to
       identifY and provide services for recipients with a history of domestic violence; and to
       waive program requirements "such as time limits ... , residency requirements, child support
       cooperation requirements; and family cap provisions" when it would endanger, penalize,
       or put at risk such victims.

      Senate Amendment (Murray) --
                                  Hex-Dilmp Conve:sion

   States shall not be subject to any numerical limitation in granting domestic
    violence waivers.
   HHS must exclude recipients granted domestic violence waivers by a state when it
    determines whether a state has complied with work participation rates and
    enforcement of the time limit, as well as whether penalties should be imposed.
