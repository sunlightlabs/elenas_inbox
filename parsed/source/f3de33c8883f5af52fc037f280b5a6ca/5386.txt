TEXT:
Attached is background material for the Monday leak of several of our new
education initiatives: Education Opportunity Zones, Mentoring, and School
Construction, with the most detail and emphasis on the Zones. The
material was prepared as press paper for an event, though it won't be
given it out. It includes a 3-page description of the initiatives, a
4-page set of examples of districts that are doing the kinds of things the
Zones initiative promotes, and an example of how an urban district would
use the grant funds.  While this seems like a lot, it will enable whoever
is going to talk to the press to seem knowledgeable, respond to questions,
and control the amount of information and level of detail that is provided.

After reviewing the attached material, we've still got to deal with the
following issues before we swing into action:

.1. OMB Passback: OMB's passback last Wednesday provides a significant
 obstacle to our planned leak, since they proposed an alternative to this
 initiative. Our materials and OMB's proposal don't match up well at all.
 How do we negotiate this out with OMB before we can proceed?

OMB's passback did not approve the Department's urban initiative, but
instead recommends a one-time $500 million advanced appropriation for FY
2000, targeted to the same urban and rural districts we are aiming for.
It has quite a different design as well -- it essentially (1) provides
bonuses to school districts that show substantial gains in student
performance sine FY 1995, when Goals 2000 and the overhauled Title 1 funds
started flowing; (2) uses the Obey-Porter school reform funds in the FY 98
appropriations bill as the source of new funds to help districts that have
not yet made significant gains; and, in a bow to the President's agenda,
(3) requires districts to show progress toward eliminating social
promotions.

This is basically Barry White's plan. While there are some interesting
aspects to it--especially financial rewards for district performance and
the incorporation of Obey-Porter and other federal funds--it is not the
approach we have been taking with ED.  Barry is well aware of where we are
on this initiative.


2. Especially in light of the above issue, how much detail should we give
the press at this point about the Education Zones initiative?

3.   Assuming we go forward with our version of this,   I've tried to find a


balance between our hard-edge accountability emphasis, and a real emphasis
on the added opportunities provided by the funding.   In particular, I've
specifically not used the words "end "social promotions", and I've
structured the materials so the issue can be approached with a great
emphasis on providing extra help to kids, and indirectly, by way of
examples (e.g., Chicago) of the kinds of practices we are trying to spread
around the country.

4. Elena and I have not discussed who we leak this to, and I don't know
what Sylvia has had in mind.  I assume we want nationwide coverage prior
to the Town Meeting, so I suggest USA Today and/or AP. The Post would
also be "good.

5. We also need to figure out who talks to the press.    I think the
options are anyone of the three of us, sylvia or Rahm. I trust us to get
the right combination of spin and substance and, as important, to know
what not to say in the interest of preventing a firestorm on the left.

6. We need to brief some of our friends on Monday as well. Elena apd
Minyon have discussed the need to brief members of the Black and Hispanic
Caucuses; so far in preparation for this all IO,ve been able to do is
determine that Andy Blocker will not be around on Monday (leaving the CBC
to Minyon) and leave messages for Minyon and Janet to call me.

We also need to give a heads up to some of the key education groups: AFT,
NEA, Great City Schools and perhaps the Urban League and MALDEF, all of
whom have been meeting with ED staff on urban issues.  They are the most
likely places the press will go for reaction; the Great City Schools will
be the most helpful, and we should steer them there.  If needed, I will
enlist Gerry Tirozzi, the Assistant Secretary who has been leading this
effort, to help out with these notifications.

     Strengthening Public Schools By Raising Standards, Expanding Opportunity, and
                                Requiring Accountability


NEW ADMINISTRATION EDUCATION INITIATIVESUNDER DEVELOPMENT.
The Administration is developing a package of new education initiatives designed to strengthen
public schools, continue the push for all students to meet high academic standards, and help
students take advantage of significant new financial aid for college. The initiatives are geared
towards the needs of students and schools in impoverished urban and rural areas. These
initiatives would:

      Declare high-poverty school districts as Education Opportunity Zones, making them
       eligible for additional Federal funding if they adopt tough reform measures --like those
       adopted in Chicago -- that make administrators, principals, teachers, and students truly
       accountable for success or failure.

      Give low-income kids middle-class expectations of college and success by reaching them
       in the sixth or seventh grade with (1) a strong message about the college financial aid
       they are eligible for, and (2) intensive, sustained mentoring and other support through
       programs sponsored by colleges.

      Help communities throughout the country deal with the problems of overcrowded and
       aged school facilities, and the need for substantial renovations and repairs.

These initiatives have not yet been finalized. Consultation with the education community, state
and local officials, higher education, community groups and others is still underway. Final
budget numbers will not be determined until the FY 1999 budget process is completed.

EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ZONES: OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
FOR REACHING CHALLENGING ACADEMIC STANDARDS. The Administration is
developing an Education Opportunity Zones initiative. This competitive challenge grants
program is aimed at demonstrating comprehensive, coordinated and effective approaches to
expanding opportunities for students in high poverty urban and rural school districts, coupled
with a balanced approach to increased responsibility for results for schools, educators and
students themselves.

To receive funds, local school districts will demonstrate how they will:
      provide students and parents with choice within the public school system;

      hold schools accountable for helping students reach academic standards, including
       rewarding schools that succeed and intervening in schools that fail to make progress;
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion


      hold teachers and principals accountable for quality, including rewarding outstanding
       teachers, and implementing processes for fairly and quickly removing ineffective
       teachers.

      require students to meet academic standards at key transition points in their academic
       careers.

School districts can use Education Opportunity Zone funds to:

      provide extra help to students in need it in order to meet challenging standards, through
       after-school or Saturday tutoring programs and/or summer school.

      provide bonuses to schools that make significant gains in student achievement, and tum
       around failing schools by implementing proven reform models, providing intensive
       teacher training, building stronger partnerships between schools and parents, businesses
       and community-based organizations, or closing down failing schools and reopening them
       as charter schools.

      provide needed training to teachers and principals; reward outstanding teachers by
       helping them earn certification as master teachers from the National Board for
       Progressional Teaching standards and providing them with financial incentives when they
       do; and implement programs to identify low performing teachers, providing them help to
       improve, and removing them fairly and quickly if they don't.

Examples of Local School Districts Using These Approaches. (See Attachment)

 Spreading Practices Nationwide. These are the kinds of approaches that must be replicated
 everywhere in order to strengthen public schools. The President's Education Opportunity Zones
 challenge grants will help demonstrate how they can work and spread them to cities and rural
 communities with students that can benefit from them the most. They will help make sure that
 our most disadvantaged students are held to high academic standards and helped to reach them .
.They will help make sure that disadvantaged students can choose among good public schools,
 and are not trapped in failing schools. They will help reach the President's goal of having at
 least one Master Teacher in every school, which is particularly important for students in high
 poverty schools, because these schools often have the least well prepared teachers.

Budget. Budget figures have not been finalized for this initiative yet, though we anticipate
providing several hundred million per year, and more than 1 billion over 5 years. We anticipate
that 10-15 urban districts will receive grants in the range of$10 - $25 million per year, and 10-
15 (consortia oj) rural districts (including one serving Tribal schools) in the range of $2 - $5
million per year. Grants would be for three years, with the possibility ofan additional two
years for districts that show significant academic gains. An example ofhow a typical urban
district -- Cincinnati -- could use the funds, is attached. Note: We might want to hold back any
detail on budget pending discussions with OMB
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


       Q_ Will local districts have to use the national test in order to participate in this
       initiative?

       A. No, we have consistently said that use of the tests is voluntary and would not be a
       condition ofreceiving federal funds. We expect each district to demonstrate that they
       are using challenging academic standards--either their own or those adopted by the
       state. Of course, they are free to use the national tests if they wish, and 15 ofthe largest
       urban school systems have already signed up to use the tests when they become available
       (in 2000). Keep in mind that the national reading and math standards are generally
       higher than what is being used in most states and districts; it would be unrealistic to use
       them for accountability purposes in the short run, though districts may want to phase this
       in over time.

6TH GRADE MENTORING INITIATIVE.
    Building on successful "I Have a Dream" type programs, this effort would target
     high-poverty students in sixth or seventh grade and (1) make sure they know money is no
     longer a barrier to college, and (2) provide them with an adult mentor, other support
     services, and a connection to a college, sustained from middle school through high school
     graduation.

      Goal is to create, in all children, the expectation that they will go to college.

     A key role is envisioned for colleges to ensure a high-quality, sustained effort;
      Administration officials have already sought advice from more than 200 college
      presidents and many education associations.

      Research demonstrates that these types of efforts are effective. For example, in the
       rigorously-evaluated Quantum Opportunities Program, 42 percent of the participants
       attended college, compared to 16 percent in the control group.

      This would be connected to a wider information campaign to make all Americans aware
       of the financial aid that is now available for college.

SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION. President Clinton intends to continue
to press the Congress to enact a School Construction Initiative, to help states and local
communities
throughout the country deal with the problems of overcrowded and aged school facilities, and the
need for substantial renovations and repairs.

     Previous proposal was $5 billion in interest subsidies, with half of it going to the 100
      school districts with the largest number of poor children. Since then, a number of other
      proposals have been developed in Congress. We are reviewing all of the approaches.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

               BE SUPPORTED UNDER THE PROPOSAL

                     DRAFf -- November 29, 1997

Student Assistance and Accountability:

      In Chicago, many students participate in the district's Lighthouse after-school
       program, which features intense reading/math instruction, social activities; a meal, and
       other enrichment activities_ Students in the district who perform below minimum
       standards at key transition grades (3, 6, 8 and 9) are required to participate in a
       seven-week "SummerBridge" program and pass a test before moving on to the next
       grade. Over 45,000 students were served in the SummerBridge program in 1997,
       and over 144,000 students participated in some form of summer activity.

      This summer Denver served approximately 2,400 students in grades 3, 5, and 8 who
       were required to attend to address subpar reading scores. And the Long Beach
       school district required 1,600 third graders who had not attained reading
       proficiency by the end of the year to attend five-week tutorial sessions.

      In Cincinnati, student promotion is now based on specific standards that define what
       students must know and be able to do. The standards are designed to prepare students to
       pass the state's ninth-grade proficiency test.

      As part of the superintendent's focus on reading, the Houston school district is
       hiring 150 reading coaches. The coaches, mainly college students, will receive $10
       per hour to tutor about 1,000 children on a one-to-one basis. Designed by the
       University of Texas at Dallas, the program will use an intensive approach. The
       university is training the tutors and the district is funding the program from the
       general budget.

Staff Effectiveness and Accountability:

      Charlotte-Mecklenburg's Benchmark Goals program gives cash awards of$750 to
       $1,000 to teachers in schools when their students meet a range of goals based on their
       previous performance. The goals are structured so that schools have an incentive to raise
       the achievement of their lowest performing students. It also focuses on goals for African
       American students, who historically have been under-achievers in the Charlotte school
       system, ensuring that schools work to close the achievement gap with white students.

      In Cincinnati, school district administrators' pay raises are now linked to job
       performance, with automatic cost-of-living adjustments and salary rates being
       replaced with new criteria, including performance on several measures such as
       student test scores and graduation rates. The district is also preparing a system for
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

      providing f"mandal rewards to schools based on student achievement, to take effect
      in 1998-99.

     In St. Paul, the school district is collaborating with the teachers' union and the University of
      Minnesota on Project 20/20 to support teachers through the National Board for Professional
      Teaching Standards (NBPTS) certification process. The district pays the application fees and
      the university and other partners develop and conduct professional support programs for the
      candidates.

     States like North Carolina and Kentucky, and school districts like Los Angeles, are
      providing significant salary increases to reward National Board Certified Master
      Teachers.

     Peer review and assistance programs help beginning teachers learn to teach and
      help veterans who are having difficulty improve their teaching or leave the
      classroom without union grievances or delays. In Cincinnati, for example,
      low-performing teachers can be assigned to an intervention program where they
      gain assistance from colleagues and administrators, and if unable to improve, are
      counseled out ofthe profession or removed. In Cincinnati, as well as Toledo, while
      most teachers improve their performance, roughly one-third of the teachers referred
      to intervention have left teaching by the end of the year, through resignation,
      retirement or dismissal.

      In Rochester, expert, experienced teachers can be selected through a rigorous
      evaluation process as "lead teachers" and given significant salary stipends to
      become involved with peer counseling, or to take on other reform-related priorities
      such as consulting with new teachers, accepting positions in "intervention" schools,
      and developing curricula. Columbus and Seattle also have aggressive peer review
      programs.

     New York City's Community District 2 places an unusually strong emphasis on
      providing ongoing opportunities for teachers to build skills and learn from one another.
       For example, the district has created a laboratory in which visiting teachers observe
      and practice with a highly accomplished teacher for three weeks while their classrooms
      are taught by another experienced teacher. District 2 registered the second highest
      standardized test scores in math and reading in the city.

     In 1996, Memphis opened its new Teaching and Learning Academy, which
      coordinates professional development opportunities for all teachers in the district.
      The Academy offers workshops in all major areas of school reform including
      leadership, core content, performance assessment, and uses of technology.

School Improvement and Accountability:

     The San Francisco Unified School District places low-performing schools on a one-year
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

    probationary period, during which they are expected to improv~ student performance. If
    there is no improvement, the school is reconstituted. All staff must reapply for jobs at
    their school, and the Board hires a new principal, who in tum hires a new teaching staff
    and support staff. The new team must then put together an improvement plan to raise
    student achievement. Since the 1993-94 school year, ten schools have been
    reconstituted.

   The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system distributes to parents easy-to-read
    student learning goals at the beginning of the school year. The district then follows
    up with school report cards on student attendance and performance that are
    distributed to parents and every household in the district, and are published in the
    newspaper, in part to help inform parents' decisions about the district's magnet schools.

   In Chicago, schools can be placed on probation due to low student achievement.
    These schools will be targeted for aggressive intervention strategies by the district,
    such as providing intensive help and training from expert teams of educators, or,
    where necessary, replacing ineffective principals and teachers. In the event of
    persistent failure, the district may shut down and reorganize the schools. Seven
    high schools were reconstituted between the 1996-97 and 1997-98 school years.

    Chicago also recognizes a number of exemplary schools, providing rmancial
    rewards of $5,000 and $10,000 to the winners to become professional development
    centers for other schools. Seventeen schools were awarded exemplary status in the
    first year.

   As part of Kentucky's school accountability program under the Kentucky Education
    Reform Act, schools that do not reach academic and non-academic (attendance, retention,
    dropout, transition to the next level of schools or the job market) accountability targets
    must develop their own school improvement plan. If a school fails to improve over the
    next two years, the state assigns a distinguished educator to provide support and advice to
    the school. If the school's performance continues to decline, the state can assume
    control. Although the state has yet to take over a school, 88 schools were recently
    identified as being in decline and nine have been placed in the "crisis" category.

    Late last summer, Cleveland reconstituted two elementary schools that had failed to meet
    district-mandated school performance indicators and where there had been significant
    internal strife among staffmernbers. The district reassigned the schools' principals and
    asked all teaching staff to reapply for their positions. As a result, about two-thirds of
    teachers at the reconstituted schools are new to the buildings this year. And earlier this
    year Denver, working closely with the teacher's union there, reconstituted two
    elementary schools, replacing nearly the entire staff at each.

   New York City also has a union-district negotiated process for "redesigning"
    schools identified by the state as failing. Such schools can replace approximately
    half the incumbent teaching faculty.
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


     In Memphis, since 1995, about half of all schools have adopted a "break-the-mold"
      reform model, including several of the models developed by the New American
      Schools Development Corporation.



Public School Choice:

     In Boston, all parents choose their child's public school, and have a wide array of options
      ranging from neighborhood schools, magnet schools, and pilot and public charter schools
      which operate under performance contracts that provide them with greater autonomy and
      accountability for results.

     The Houston Independent School District recently instituted an open choice
      program. Parents may send their children to any of the district's 258 schools
      provided the school is enrolled at 95 percent of capacity or below. The district is
      currently analyzing available space and plans to publish the information in the near
      future; parents will apply to the district transfer office to change schools. HISD
      will not transport students to schools outside their attendance area. In addition to
      this choice program, the district has launched an aggressive effort to support in-district
      charter schools.

     Cambridge allows every family to choose a public school for their child. The school district
      provides information on every school and has created parent centers to help parents learn
      about and choose a public school for their child. More than 90 of parents get their first
      choice of kindergarten for their child, and most get one of their top picks at all grade levels.

      The San Diego school district has helped parents, teachers, and principals create more than a
      dozen public charter schools that stay open only 톋s long as they do a good job. These are all
      schools of choice, publicly accountable and open to students from around the school district.

     In August 1997, Denver's rIrst charter school re-opened as the Pioneer Charter
      School (PCS). PCS is a joint effort of the school district and the University of

                   Porter-Obey
                   Under preliminary estimates, Ohio could receive nearly $6 M in Porter-Obey funds; no further
                          breakdown currently available. Based solely on enrollment, one could expect that about
                         .3% would go to Cincinnati, or about $180,000 total. If, based on poverty, grant quality,
                          etc., Cincinnati received 10% of Ohio's share, or $600,000, that would be about 'l2 the
                          amount projected here for beginning dramatic improvemerits or reconstitution in the
                          lowest-achieving 10% of the district's schools.
