TEXT:
As a result of the kick-off of the PresidentO,s Initiative on Race, many
offices have been receiving comments, suggestions, recommendations for
model programs, offers of assistance, inquiries about the Advisory Board
and Initiative staff positions (even though the Advisory Board is set) and
other inquiries.

We have developed the following system for responding to incoming calls
and mail:

Constituency Inquiries
For incoming calls and mail from your particular constituency, please
respond with information and the appropriately-tailored letter from you.
To send a letter, see the attached basic letter on the Initiative. To
provide information, see the attached fact sheets on the Initiative and
the Advisory Board.  If you receive letters which seek to assist in the
effort, please add appropriate language about including them in the
process and stating that the initiative staff will get back with them.
(We have received a lot of good will at this point and do not want to
discourage people who are working hard on this issue and may help us.)

After responding to an incoming letter, please pass a copy of the letter
onto the Chief of StaffO,s office (Andrew Mayock, Room 164 OEOB) so it may
be included in.the materials being gathered for the Initiative staff.  It
is important to forward these letters so that they can be passed along to
the Initiative staff who will work with this material and reach out to
these people.

Advisory Board and Initiative Staff Position Inquiries
Please send all inquiries about the Advisory Board and Initiative staff
positions to Charles Duncan in Room 139 OEOB.  Presidential Personnel will
respond to inquiries about the Advisory Board with a letter explaining
that the Advisory Board has been selected and describing its members.
Presidential Personnel will also collect and respond to resumes from
individuals interested in staff positions.  These resumes will be
forwarded to the InitiativeO,s executive director when that position is
determined.

General Inquiries
For general inquiries that do not fall in your area of responsibility,
please pass the information directly to the Chief of StaffO,s office
(Andrew Mayock, Room 164 OEOB).  If it is a phone call, they may be
transferred to 456-6797.  This office will respond and catalogue these
inquiries.

Thank you.     Please call if you have questions or suggestions about these


  materials or this process.   (And please pray for the quick assembling of
  the Initiative staff.)

                         THE PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE ON RACE

        "In the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out of the power of our
example here at home, out of our ability to remain strong as one America... We are the world's
most diverse democracy, and the world looks to us to show that it is possible to live and advance
together across those kinds of difJerences ... Building one America is our most important
mission. .. money cannot buy it. Power cannot compel it. Technology cannot create it. It can
only come from the human spirit. "
                                                -- President Clinton, February 4, J997

                     WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S RACE INITIATIVE?

        This initiative is a year-long effort, led by the President, to present to the nation his vision
of a stronger, more just and more united American community, offering opportunity and fairness
for all Americans. The President's initiative will combine constructive dialogue, study, and
action. It will examine the current state of race relations and our common future, look at the
laws and policies that can help to ensure that we remain One America, and enlist individuals,
communities, businesses and government at all levels in an effort to understand our differences
as we appreciate the values that unite us.

                WHY A MAJOR INITIATIVE ON RACE, AND WHY NOW?

       President Clinton's personal, life-long commitment. Growing up in the South, the
President saw for himself the great harm caused by racial discrimination, and the difference that
can be achieved by changing both policies and attitudes. That longstanding, deeply personal
commitment has led him to make this initiative one of his major second-term priorities. He
knows that America can reach its full potential only by enlisting the full energies of all our
people, and giving all our citizens, of every background, the chance to make the most of their
own God-given talents.

         Not a crisis, but an opportunity. This effort builds on the President's record
throughout his first term (defending affirmative action, major speeches on race and
reconciliation, etc.). But unlike previous Presidential efforts in this area, President Clinton's
initiative is the result not of a crisis, but of a unique opportunity:

       America is strong enough to look to the future. Having moved aggressively in the first
       term to get the country back on the right track -- reversing the rising tide of crime,
       welfare, budget deficits, unemployment and income inequality -- the President believes
       that it is time for America to address these issues as we prepare for the 21 st Century.

       Many "wedge" issues have been defused. On many of the issues that had been used to
        divide the country -- such as crime and welfare -- the President has begun to change the
       terms of the debate, pointing to solutions instead of pointing fingers, and defusing
       tensions so that an honest dialogue about race can begin.


                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
to take responsibility -- for ourselves and our families, for our community and at home with one
another. It is a call to citizenship, because the President believes that being a good citizen
includes recognizing the promise of America -- an America free of destructive bigotry, a nation
that welcomes those who play by the rules, serve their community and reach out to make all
Americans feel at home. This is a great nation, and the true measure of our greatness is in the
human heart.

               WHAT ARE THE INITIATIVE'S GOALS AND METHODS?

       The initiative will have five central goals:

       1) To articulate the President's vision of racial reconciliation and ajust, unified America;
       2) To help educate the nation about the facts surrounding the issue of race;
       3) To promote a constructive dialogue, to confront and work through the difficult and
       controversial issues surrounding race;
       4) To recruit and encourage leadership at all levels to help bridge racial divides;
       5) To find, develop and implement solutions in critical areas such as education, economic
       opportunity, housing; health care, crime and the administration of justice -- for
       individuals, communities, corporations and government at all levels.

       The President hopes to achieve these goals through the following methods:

        Presidential leadership. The President will begin a national examination of race
and reconciliation -- explaining why the goal of One America is so important to preparing
for the 21st Century, addressing the facts about race, encouraging others to discuss
difficult racial issues that we too often avoid and reaching out to Americans of every race to
get them engaged in the process. Unlike previous national efforts, this initiative will be led
directly and personally by the President throughout.

       Dialogue, study and action. Through dialogue, study and action, we will increase
our understanding of race, and propose and promote policies and solutions that can make a
difference.

       Dialogue. Dialogue can help to inform, and to build support for constructive
       solutions to the issues of race. For an entire generation growing up after the civil
       rights movement, there has been little or no public articulation of the values and
       ideals of racial reconciliation. (And too often the rhetoric has been negative,
       helping to confirm derogatory stereotypes.) This initiative will employ the power of
       the Presidency to encourage open, candid debate about difficult issues and to
       highlight actions by individuals, communities, businesses and government that are
       working in this area now.

       Study. The issues to be addressed will include: different perceptions and
       experiences of Americans of different races, confronting harmful stereotypes and
       examining serious problems. While the initiative will be largely forward-looking, it
       is also important to help educate Americans about the past -- so that the nation has
       a clear sense of what has come before, recognizing the unique experience of African

                                                2
       Action. Throughout this effort, attention will go to policies that can make a
       difference and solutions that can be implemented by individuals, community
       groups, state and local governments and the federal government. Examples of
       issues to be addressed include the lack of economic progress among Hispanic
       Americans and the greatly reduced number of black and Hispanic students in California.
       This nation has made real progress, but we know that there is more that must be done.

             An example of dialogue, study and action is the President's 5/16/97 apology to the
              survivors of the Tuskeegee Study, which was combined with concrete actions and
              further study (establishing a bioethics center at Tuskeegee; studying ways to
              involve minority communities in research and health care; new training materials
              for medical researchers on ethics and how to apply them to diverse populations;
              and new postgraduate fellowships in bioethicists for minorities).

                   ELEMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE

       Advisory Board. This small, diverse group will advise the President and assist him
in outreach efforts and consultations with experts. They were chosen based on their
outstanding leadership on this issue and their contributions to America's ongoing dialogue
about race and reconciliation.

        Significant Presidential events/actions throughout the year. Events held
throughout the year will include town hall meetings in different regions of the country,
meetings with the advisory board and other events which will enable the President to carry
out his goals for the initiative.

       Outreach, consultation and leadership recruitment. The effort will include
outreach to community leaders, religious leaders, state and local elected officials, members
of Congress, business leaders and individuals, encouraging them to become involved in
reconciliation and com~unity-building projects.

       The President's Report to the American People. The President will issue a report
next summer, in which he will:
      Present his vision of One America, including an illustration and assessment of the
       growing diversity of our nation and of his consultations with his advisory board;
      Reflect the work that has occurred during the year, including the conversations and
       suggestions made at town hall meetings and other venues;
      Report on how the nation has evolved on the issue ofrace over the past 30 years,
       including the studies commissioned for the initiative;
      Provide recommendations and solutions that enable individuals, communities, businesses,
        organizations and government to address difficult issues and build on our best
       possibilities.

Dear Name:

Thank you for recent letter regarding _ __        We appreciate your efforts and concerns
regarding race relations.

"One America in the 21st Century: The President's Initiative on Race" is about developing
policies and engaging people to help us respect each others' differences and yet be a united
America. Through dialogue, study and action, we will work to increase our understanding of
race and promote policies and solutions that can make a difference. As the President made clear
in his speech in San Diego, he believes that it is a matter of the utmost importance that all
Americans, regardless of race, expand their common ground and focus more on what unites us
than on what divides us. Furthermore, he believes that public discourse and action will help
guide us down the path toward greater unity.

The President's Initiative on Race will help build a stronger, more just and more united
American community that offers opportunity and fairness for all Americans. Through your
input and your activity in your own community, we hope you will continue to be one of the
people leading this effort.

                                             Sincerely,
