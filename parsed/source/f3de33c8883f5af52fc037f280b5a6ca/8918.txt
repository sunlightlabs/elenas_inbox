                                         President Clinton
         A Record of Partnership With American Indians and Alaska Natives


"My administration has worked in partnership with tribal leaders ... to protect American
Indian religious freedom, promote tribal self-determination, preserve tribal natural resources
and provide economic opportunities for Native Americans. I look forward to continuing this
government-to-government relationship in order to build on the progress we have made in
Indian Country."
                                                                  President Bill Clinton

On April 29, 1994, President Clinton became the first President to invite the leaders of all
federally recognized Tribes to the White House. On this historic occasion, the President pledged
that his Administration would work with Tribal leaders to establish a true
government-to-government partnership. The Clinton Administration has delivered on this
commitment by:

Strengthening the Relationship Between the Federal Government and Tribal Nations

   In 1994, executed a Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
    directing agencies to consult, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent pennitted by
    law, with tribal governments prior to taking actions that affect federally recognized tribal
    governments.

   On May 14, 1998, issued an executive order that strengthens and makes effective across
    Administrations the 1994 Government-to-Govemment memorandum. This executive order
    serves to establish regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with Indian tribal
    governments in the development of regulatory practices on Federal matters that significantly
    or uniquely affect their communities, to reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon
    Indian tribal governments, and to streamline the application process for and increase the
    availability of waivers to Indian tribal governments.

Expanding the role ofAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives throughout his
Administration

   Appointed 59 Native Americans to all levels of his Administration, including 10 to top
    positions requiring Senate confinnation and 30 to Presidential appointment positions.

    Indian Tribes and ensure aggressive representation of tribal sovereignty in the courts.

   Established the American Indian Environmental Office to work with Tribes to protect water
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
    quality and the environment in Indian Country.

   Created a pennanent White House working group composed of all Executive Branch
    Departments to advance Tribal sovereignty across the administration.

    ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites by Indian religious practitioners and to avoid
    adversely affecting the physical integrity of such sacred sites.

   Successfully fought for passage ofthe American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments
    and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in order to protect the right of free exercise of
    Tribal religions.

   Directed federal agencies to ensure efficient collection and distribution of available eagle
    feathers and eagle parts to American Indians and Alaska Natives for traditional religious
    purposes.

Promoting Tribal Self-Determination

   Supported passage and implementation of the Indian Self-Detennination Act and the Tribal
    Self-Governance Act, which give Tribal governments control of most federal resources spent
    within Indian Country.

   Successfully fought attempts to penalize tribes for exercising their powers of self-governance
    and allowing states to tax Tribal governments on new trust lands.

Increasing Educational Opportunities

   Proposed a 59% increase in funding for construction and facilities improvement and
    repair for Native American Schools in his FY 1999 budget.

   Provided an 11 percent increase (from $60 million to $66 million) for the Indian
    Education Act in his FY 1999 budget. Serving nearly half a million Native American
    students, the Act's programs include grants to Local Education Agencies (LEAs),
    Indian tribes and organizations, Indian-controlled schools, and individuals to address
    special educational and cultural academic needs of Native Americans.

   Signed an executive order that aims to ensure that tribal colleges and universities are
    more fully recognized as accredited institutions, have access to the opportunities
    afforded other institutions, and have Federal resources committed to them on a
    continuing basis.

Providing Economic Development Opportunities in Indian Country
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

   Established an Office of Native American Programs within the Minority Business
    Development Association at the Department of Commerce, with eight Native American
    Business Development Centers and a business consultant, that provides management and
    technical assistance to Native American businesses.

   Signed the Community Development Banking and Regulatory Improvement Act, which
    promotes more lending in Indian Country;

Protecting Tribal Natural Resources

   Established for the first time the right of Alaska Natives to fish for subsistence purposes.

   Requested $875 million (a $130 million increase) in his FY 1999 budget for EPA State and
    Tribal Assistance Grants. As a part of this program, EPA will continue to build an support
    tribal capacity to implement, operate, and enforce Federal environmental laws.

   Supported the exercise of Northwest Tribes' treaty fishing rights.

   Supported funding for continued implementation of the Indian Child Welfare Act and tribal
    consensus amendments to protect Indian families and culture.

   Signed into law the Indian Tribal Justice Support Act to improve criminal law enforcement in
    Indian Country.

   Directed the Attorney General and the Secretary ofthe Interior to work with tribal leaders and
    propose improvements for public safety and criminal justice in Indian Country. As a result
    of this process, the President's FY 1999 budget contains a $182 million initiative within the
    Justice and Interior Departments to raise the level of law enforcement in Indian country to
    national standards.

   Devoted $54 million in his FY 1999 budget to hiring police officers through the COPS
    program exclusively in Indian country.
