            universities both large and small, historically black colleges and universities,

            activities they held on their campus.

            Advisory Board Participation. Advisory Board members participated in a
            number of events at different college and university campuses. On April 8,
            Governor Kean hosted a town hall meeting at Drew University in which Angela
            Oh, Secretary Richard Riley, and Ted Carter, Deputy Assistant Secretary at
            Treasury participated. Close to 500 people attended the town hall meeting,

            and I participated in a town hall meeting at Howard University which was
            televised live by C-SPAN. Between April 3 and April 7, Angela Oh visited the
            campuses ofthe University of California at Irvine, Stanford, Yale, and Princeton to speak
            with students about the Initiative. On April 7, Governor Kean participated in a dialogue
            sponsored by several colleges in New York City. On April 8, Governor Winter engaged
            a group of students, faculty and community resource people about "Learning from our

        Cabinet Secretary Participation. On April 8, Attorney General Reno visited
        Temple University to support the Race Initiative's Campus Week of Dialogue
        effort. She conducted a "One America Conversation" with a diverse group of 30
        students from Temple's College and Law School. Following the "One America
        Conversation," the Attorney General delivered a speech in the Law School to an
        audience of about 600 students, about 200 of whom were in the packed
        classroom in which she spoke; an additional 400 students saw her speech as it
        was simulcast to other law school classrooms. In her speech, the Attorney
        General encouraged students to continue the dialogue on race issues being
        promoted by your Initiative on Race and stressed the importance of students
        learning to work together across racial differences to build better, stronger and

        representatives to discuss how community development programs which are supported by

        neighborhoods, increase economic opportunities as well as improve cross-racial
