I. ADMINISTRATION REVIEW OF SETTLEMENT

The Administration has engaged in an intensive review of the settlement on two fronts.
Intemally, four work groups were created and dozens of officials from across the Administration
participated in their reviews. These work groups were: Regulatory Issues; Program and Budget
Issues; Legal Issues; and, Industry Performance and Accountability Issues. They conducted a
line-by-line analysis of the 68-page settlement document; in addition, they sought to explore
altemative approaches to proposals contained in the settlement. This has not been done in an
attempt to "fix" the settlement but rather to assess the adequacy of the settlement's provisions
and to provide the Administration with the basis for articulating its positions and principles if a
decision is made to encourage a legislative initiative.

Externally, the Vice President, Secretary Shalala and Bruce Reed met with individuals and
groups representing a wide variety of views and interests to make certain that the Administration
is aware of diverse viewpoints and has the benefit of expertise from outside the Administration.
These consultations have been with public health and tobacco control organizations, state
attorneys generals, tobacco industry lawyers, representatives of the smokeless and cigar
industries, tobacco industry ''whistle blowers," representatives of the retail, vending and the
advertising industries, agricultural leaders from the Southeastern tobacco-growing states, and
officials from the Brooke Group (Liggett). This broad range of viewpoints has informed the
Administration's review and analysis. These consultations have made clear that any legislative
proposal will be buffeted from many sides, several of which were not included in the
negotiations among the state attorneys generals, plaintiffs' attorneys, and the tobacco industry.


II. EVENTS AND INTERESTS LIKELY TO SHAPE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

While the proposed tobacco settlement presents the President with an opportunity to exercise
again his leadership on this vital public health issue, there are many other factors beyond the
settlement that shape the current landscape and will change it in the future. Some enhance the
opportunity presented to the President; some limit it.


Public Health Community
Since the June announcement of the settlement, the public health community has become
increasingly skeptical of the particular elements of the settlement and, more important, has
become increasingly unified in their criticisms. At the same time, the public health community
is willing to consider and back the possibility of a legislative solution. It should also be noted
that the unity of the public health community can be easily fractured: While they generally agree
on what's wrong with the settlement, they have different ideas on what good solutions would be.
                                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


That means merely articulating particular "fixes" to the settlement as opposed to stating positions
and principles could very well undercut the President's core base of support.

The principal public health criticisms of the settlement are:
o Restricting FDA's authority in any fashion
o Ineffective "look back" penalties on companies for not reducing underage smoking
o Limiting disclosure of industry documents
o Failing to increase the price of cigarettes sufficiently
o Preempting state and local restrictions that might be tougher than the settlement (the impact on
additional state restrictions is unclear)
o Failing to address international tobacco control
o Limiting liability, i.e., eliminating past punitive damages and capping future punitive damages
and eliminating class actions (The public health community will always have a lingering
concern about limiting liability as the basis for a settlement. It is not only a desire to "punish"
this industry, but it also reflects a belief that the threat of litigation will always be needed to keep
this industry in check.)

Moreover, there is a small but significant portion (American Lung Association, Stan Glantz,
grass roots tobacco control groups like the state GASPS, and Public Citizen) of the public health
community that believes the settlement should be scuttled entirely, not fixed. The public health
community is well aware of all these tensions, and in fact, this community attempted to forge a
consensus again in August. Representatives of 11 groups met August 8, and worked over the
next two weeks to present the Administration with a consensus document. However, this
"consensus" statement ended up saying little more than that the public health community would
like to see a settlement reached and would be willing to work for it; they could not come to
terms as to what the settlement should in fact look like. Also, this "consensus" statement does
not preclude individual groups from identifying issues of particular concern for them and actively
seeking support in Congress for their viewpoint.


Lawsuits and Disclosure
A number of tobacco lawsuits are proceeding: the second-hand smoke lawsuit in Florida by the
airline attendants; various private lawsuits, both individual suits and class-actions; and the
Medicaid lawsuits by the states, most importantly those in Texas and Minnesota because of their
timing. Any verdict against the tobacco industry will be widely viewed as another reason either
not to negotiate with the industry or to take a stronger stance against the industry on several
elements in the proposal. On the other hand, a verdict for the industry is likely to be seen as a
reason to move forward with a legislative solution and weakening our position in any
negotiations.

Just as important as the impact of any verdict is the disclosure issue raised by these lawsuits.
Especially in the Medicaid lawsuit in Minnesota, state attorneys hold out the prospect of new
industry documents coming to light that go far beyond any disclosed to date. In Florida and
Minnesota, preliminary findings of fraud and criminal activity were made by either judges or
special masters, and previously privileged documents are now being reviewed for public
                                                                                 Hex·Dump Conversion

disclosure (in Florida, documents were disclosed in early August; in Minnesota, it is expected
documents would become public by early 1998 when the case goes to trial). In addition, there
is the possibility of indictments and trials because of ongoing DOJ criminal investigations and
the resulting disclosure of secret documents in that process. Because no one really knows what
is in the still secret documents, one concem is that they reveal activity that would generate such
public outrage, that any accommodation with the industry would be seen as "selling out." In
addition, some tie the disclosure issue to consideration of whether the immunity provisions of the
settlement are adequate. Some Democrats, such as Sen. Patrick Leahy, take the position that any
consideration of limiting liability has to be predicated on full disclosure of the documents.

Another factor on the legal front is the industry challenge to the FDA rule .. Oral arguments on
the appellate case were made in the Fourth Circuit on August 11, and two of the three judges
voiced skepticism of the FDA rule. We do not know when the three-judge panel of the Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals will rule. If the FDA jurisdiction is upheld on appeal but the
government fails to overturn the district court's adverse ruling on the advertising restrictions,
there will be pressure to seek a legislative solution as the only way of moving forward. If the
appeals court overturns the district court's adverse ruling on advertising, there will be pressure to
extract even more concessions from the industry. And, finally, if the Fourth Circuit reverses the
district court's finding of jurisdiction for the FDA while upholding its ruling on advertising, the
industry may have more leverage in the discussions. However, the panel's decision may be
subejct to further review through a petition for rehearing en banc and/or petition for cert to the
Supreme Court..


Congress
The Congressional horizon is receding into 1998 very quickly. In recent days, several
Congressional leaders have said that legislative action on the settlement is unlikely in 1997. The
Senate Republican leadership has made tentative plans to consider any tobacco legislation
piecemeal, with at least six different committees having jurisdiction over parts of the settlement:
Commerce, Judiciary, Labor, Agriculture, Environment and Public Works, and.Finance. The
House Republican leadership has not indicated how it wants to proceed, although Rep. Richard
Anney has said he expects similar divided consideration in the House. In the Senate and House,
the Democratic leaderships are attempting to hold together tobacco-state and tobacco-control
Democrats and present a united front. The potential of working with Congressional Democrats
on this issue is very real and would give the Administration significant leverage in dealing with
the GOP leadership.


Farmers
With regard to the Hill, the approach the Administration takes toward the issue of helping
tobacco farmers may be the most significant. The settlement's failure to deal with tobacco
farmers provides a significant opening for the Administration. Even some GOP members who
have traditionally been supportive of the industry -- like Rep. Thomas Bliley -- are now saying
their main concern will be helping their farm constituency. The farmers who in the past have
provided substantial political cover to the industry can now be separated from the companies if


                                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
        they believe that will be in their best interest.

        Affected Industries
        In addition to the agricultural interests, several other segments of the economy are going to watch
        any settlement closely, e.g., hospitality industry with regard to environmental tobacco smoke
        (ETS), advertising and retail industries with regard to advertising and access restrictions, the
        asbestos industry and trial lawyers with regard to immunity. Each of these industries will have
        to make decisions on how a settlement affects its interests and when it wants to weigh in on the
        Hill. There is every indication that all of these industries will be very active and are already
        seeking to line up support. for their cause on the Hill.
