                         THE PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE ON RACE

        "In the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out of the power of our
example here at home, out of our ability to remain strong as one America... We are the world's
most diverse democracy, and the world looks to us to show that it is possible to live and advance
together across those kinds of difJerences ... Building one America is our most important
mission. .. money cannot buy it. Power cannot compel it. Technology cannot create it. It can
only come from the human spirit. "
                                                -- President Clinton, February 4, 1997

                     WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S RACE INITIATIVE?

        This initiative is a year-long effort, led by the President, to present to the nation his vision
of a stronger, more just and more united American community, offering opportunity and fairness
for all Americans. The President's initiative will combine constructive dialogue, study, and
action -- an examination of the current state of race relations and our common future, looking at
the laws and policies that can help to ensure that we remain One America, and enlisting everyone
in an effort to understand our differences as we appreciate the values that unite us.

                WHY A MAJOR INITIATIVE ON RACE, AND WHY NOW?

       President Clinton's personal, life-long commitment. Growing up in the South, he saw
for himself the great harm caused by racial discrimination, and the difference that can be
achieved by changing both policies and attitudes. That longstanding, deeply personal
commitment has led him to make this initiative one of his major second-term priorities. He
knows that America can reach its full potential only by enlisting the full energies of all our
people, and giving all our citizens, of every background, the chance to make the most of their
own God-given talents.

         Not a crisis, but an opportunity. This effort builds on the President's record
throughout his first term (defending affirmative action, major speeches on race and
reconciliation, etc.). But unlike previous Presidential efforts in this area, President Clinton's
initiative is the result not of a crisis, but of a unique opportunity:

       America is strong enough to look to the future. Having moved aggressively in the first
       term to get the country back on the right track -- reversing the rising tide of crime,
       welfare, budget deficits, unemployment and income inequality -- the President believes
       that it is time for America to address these issues as we prepare for the 21 st Century.

       Many "wedge" issues have been defused. On many of the issues that had been used to
        divide the country -- crime, welfare, and affirmative action -- the President has changed
       the terms of the debate, pointing to solutions instead of pointing fingers, and defusing
       tensions so that a real dialogue about race can begin.
                                                                                  ds Management System
                                                                  Automated Recor
                                                                  Hex-Dump conversion
Americans to take responsibility -- for ourselves and our families, for our community, at home
with one another. It is a call to citizenship, because the President believes that being a good
citizen includes recognizing the promise of America, an America free of destructive bigotry, a
nation that welcomes those who play by the rules, serve their community, and reach out to make
all Americans feel at home. This is a great nation, and the true measure of our greatness is in the
human heart.

                        WHAT WILL THE INITIATIVE INCLUDE?

       The initiative will have five central goals:

       1) To articulate the President's vision of racial reconciliation and a just, unified America;
       2) To teach the nation the facts surrounding the issue of race;
       3) To promote a constructive dialogue to confront and work through the difficult and
controversial issues surrounding race;
       4) To recruit and encourage leadership at all levels to help bridge racial divides;
       5) To find, develop, and implement solutions in critical areas such as education,
economic opportunity, housing, health care, crime and the administration of justice -- for
individuals, communities, corporations and government at all levels.

       The President hopes to achieve these goals through the following:

        Presidential leadership. The President will begin a national examination of race and
reconciliation -- explaining why the goal of One America is so important to preparing for
the 21st Century, addressing the facts about race, encouraging others to discuss difficult
racial issues that we too often avoid, and reaching out to Americans of every race to get
them engaged in the process. Unlike previous national efforts, this initiative will be
directly and personally led by the President throughout.

      Dialogue, study and action -- increasing our understanding of race, and proposing
and promoting policies and solutions that can make a difference.

       Dialogue can help to inform, and to build support for constructive solutions to the
       issues of race. For an entire generation growing up after the civil rights movement,
       there has been little or no public articulation of the values and ideals of racial
       reconciliation. (And too often the rhetoric has been negative, helping to confirm
       derogatory stereotypes.) This initiative will employ the power of the Presidency in
       encouraging open, candid debate about difficult issues and highlight actions by
       individuals, communities, businesses and government that are working in this area
       now.

       Study. The issues to be addressed will include: different perceptions and different


                                                 2
      examining serious problems. While the initiative will be largely forward looking, it
      is also important to teach about the past -- so that the nation has a clear sense of
      what has come before, recognizing the unique experience of African Americans
      throughout our history.

      Action. Throughout this effort, attention will go to policies that can make a
      difference and solutions that can be implemented by individuals, community
      groups, state and local governments and the federal government. Examples of issues
      to be addressed include the lack of economic progress among Hispanic Americans and
      tht< greatly reduced number of black and Hispanic students in California. This nation has
      made real progress, but we know that there is more that must be done.

             On June 7 the President announced a White House Conference on Hate Crimes
              this November 10th; bringing together victims and their families, law enforcement
              experts, and community and religious leaders. The Attorney General has begun a
              thorough review of the laws concerning hate crimes, and how we can build a plan
              of action to combat them.

                   ELEMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE

      Advisory Board. This small group will advise the President and assist him in
outreach efforts and consultations with experts. (Names to be added after 6/12.)

        Significant Presidential event/actions throughout the year. Events held throughout
the year will include town hall meetings in different regions of the country, meetings with
the advisory board, and other events which will enable the President to carry out his goals
for the initiative.

       Outreach, consultation, and leadership recruitment: The effort will include
outreach to community leaders, religious leaders, state and local elected officials, members
of Congress, business leaders and individuals, encouraging them to become involved in
reconciliation and community building projeCts.

       The President's Report to the American People will be issued next summer, in which
the President will:

The Honorable William Goodling
Chairman
Committee on Education and the Workforce
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

       As you know, the Administration and the bipartisan congressional leadership
recently reached agreement on a historic plan to balance the budget by 2002 while
investing in the future. The plan is good for America, its people, and its future, and
we are committed to working with Congress to see it enacted.

       Your committee will shortly take up important components of that Agreement,
addressing welfare to work, student loans and the Smith-Hughes Act. We appreciate
your efforts to include many provisions consistent with the Agreement, which
represent valuable policy advances.

        Welfare to Work --We are pleased that the Committee is considering provisions
that meet many of the Administration's priorities for the program. Specifically, we
are pleased that the Committee provides funds for jobs where they are needed most to
help long-term recipients in high unemployment-high poverty areas; directs funds to
local communities with large numbers of poor people; provides for local
administration by chief local elected officials working with private industry councils;
gives communities appropriate flexibility to use the funds to create successful job
placement and job creation programs; and includes the non-displacement provisions of
H.R. 1385, the House-passed job training reform bill.

       Student Loans -- We are pleased the Committee draft includes $1.763 billion in
outlay savings, including $1 billion in Federal reserves recalled from guaranty
agencies, $160 million from eliminating a fee paid to institutions in the Direct Student
Loan program, and $603 million in reduced Federal student loan administrative costs.
All these savings are being achieved without increasing costs or reducing benefits to
students and their families. We appreciate that the Committee has accepted the
Administration proposal for an enforcement provision to ensure that the $1 billion in
reserves is recovered by FY 2002. We understand that there are still details to work
out on the amounts to be recovered from each agency. We will continue to work with
the Committee on a satisfactory process.

       The Administration has the following serious concerns with other aspects of the

                                                        Auto1I\llted Records Management System
                                                        Hex-DumP Conversion

        Welfare-to-Work Grants to Cities -- The challenge of welfare reform -- moving
welfare recipients into work -- will be greatest in our Nation's large urban centers. The
Administration strongly believes that a substantial amount of all welfare-to-work
funds should be managed by cities and other local areas. The welfare-to-work structure
crafted by the Ways and Means Committee accomplishes this goal through its division of
funds between formula (50 percent) and competitive (50 percent) grants; its formula grant
sub-State allocation factors and method of administration; and its reservation of 65 percent
of competitive grants for cities. The Education and Workforce Committee would reduce
the competitive funding share from 50 percent to 5 percent, thus severely restricting the
amount for which cities can apply directly. The Administration strongly prefers the Ways
and Means proposal.

        Welfare-to-Work Peiformance Fund -- The Committee's proposal does not
include a performance fund. It is essential that welfare to work funds generate
greater levels of placement in unsubsidized jobs than States will achieve with T ANF
and other funds. We hope the Committee will be willing to consider a mechanism to
provide needed incentives and rewards for placing more of the hardest-to-serve in
lasting, unsubsidized jobs that promote self-sufficiency. We stand ready to provide
assistance in this effort.

       Minimum Wage and Workfare --The Administration strongly opposes the
Committee's proposal on the minimum wage and welfare work requirements. The
proposal is not part of the budget agreement {the underlined language was in the
Archer letter; DPC proposes to strike: and, had it been raised during negotiations,
we would have strongly opposed it.} These minimum wage and welfare work
requirements proposals would undermine the fundamental goals of welfare reform.
The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work must work, and
everyone who works should earn at least the minimum wage --whether they are
coming off welfare or not. These proposals do not meet this test. {the underlined
language was in the Archer letter, except for one phrase -- "safe work places" -- that is
covered by the Goodling Bill. DPC proposes to return to the Shaw letter formulation,
which only alluded to "work place protections". DOL prefers the Archer language:
In addition, under the proposal working welfare recipients will be deprived of the
protection of laws addressing employment discrimination, child labor, overtime, and
family and medical leave. }

       TANF and Vocational Education -- The Administration is concerned with the
Committee's proposal on vocational education in TANF. The agreement did not
address making changes in the T ANF work requirements regarding vocational
education and educational services for teen parents.

      Student Loans New Entitlement -- The Administration opposes the provision
regarding administrative cost allowances (ACAs) to guaranty agencies in the Federal
be paid at a rate of .85% of new loan volume from mandatory funding authorized
under Section 458 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), up to a cap of $170
million in FY 1998 and 1999 and $150 million in FY 2000-2002. It would represent a
new entitlement to these agencies not included in the budget agreement. Moreover,
any allowance to these agencies should bear some relationship to the costs these
agencies incur and not be based on an arbitrary formula. This is an issue for the
upcoming HEA Reauthorization.

       The Committee draft includes a provision that would reduce funds in Section
458 now available to the Secretary to administer the FFEL Program. The
Administration strongly opposes this language. Its enactment would mean the
Secretary could not effectively administer the FFEL Program.

         Smith-Hughes -- We understand that the Chairman's mark would repeal the
Smith-Hughes Act of 1917, consistent with the budget agreement. However, there may be
an effort made to eliminate this repeal. In light of the $1.2 billion annual appropriation
under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, there is no
justification for mandatory spending of$7 million per year under Smith-Hughes. We urge
the Committee to include a provision that is consistent with the budget agreement and
achieves the required $29 million in savings.

       MEWAs and Association Health Plans -- We share the goal of expanding health
insurance coverage for employees and their families. However, as discussed at greater
length in a separate letter on the free-standing bill, we cannot support the inclusion in
reconciliation of a proposal that would allow business members of multiple employer
welfare associations (MEWAs) to form "association health plans," as provided for in
H.R. 1515, the Expansion of Portability and Health Insurance Coverage Act of 1997.
The Bipartisan Budget Agreement reflects a carefully balanced negotiation, and this
provision was not part of the agreement. More important, we believe that the
provision as currently drafted has inadequate consumer protections and has the
potential to result in premium increases for small businesses and employees who may
bear the burden of adverse selection.

We believe that a great deal more work is needed before the provision is ready for
consideration. Because we share a number of common goals, including a desire to
promote small group purchasing in the small employer marketplace, we look forward
to achieving mutually held objectives outside of the budget reconciliation process.

       The budget agreement reflects compromise on many important and
controversial issues, and challenges the leaders on both sides of the aisle to achieve
consensus under difficult circumstances. We must do so on a bipartisan basis.

                                  Sincerely,
