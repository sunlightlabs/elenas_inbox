                                           Talking Points                                  draft 12/17/98

        This proposal recommends the creation of a new financing mechanism -- Livable and
         Clean Communities Bonds (LCCBs) -- to raise funds to finance environment-related public
         projects.
        Sprawl and efforts to manage it -- loosely termed smart-growth -- are quickly emerging as
         a national issue. Over 75 percent of the 224 "livable communities" ballot measures voted
         on in the 1998 elections were passed. Many of these initiatives, such as the "Clean
         Michigan Bond Proposal", included funding for bonds to promote more livable communities
       . and protect open space.
        Modeled on the school construction proposal, this bond initiative would provide new
         resources to local and state governments seeking to preserve open space, cleanup and
         redevelop brownfield sites, and restore community parks and important historic civic
         spaces.
        Like qualified zone academy bonds, this program would allow state and local governments
         to issue zero interest bonds to lenders who could claim a tax credit for the life of the bond
         in lieu of interest. The issue makes no principal or interest payments on the bond until
         maturity (13 years).
        The overall program would be capped at $500 to $700 million over five years. [Note:
         requiring the issuer to pay some amount of interest would increase the amount of bonds
         that could be issued for the stated revenue cost; the maturity could be extended to 15 or 20
         years to stretch out the time the issuer has to raise funds to pay offthe bonds).
        The allocation of the limited amount of Green Bond issuance authority would be made
         through an open competition, with State and local governments submitting plans for use of
         the bond proceeds to an inter-agency evaluation panel, chaired by EPA in consultation
         with the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and
         Treasury. The pool of available bond issuance authority would be divided in half, with
         one part reserved for a competition among the Nation's 100 largest cities and the other part
         reserved for a competition among the fifty States (the States, of course, could then use the
         bond proceeds to support projects sponsored by local governments).
        The availability of green bonds would encourage actions that recognize the relationship
         between land conservation and clean water, and development. (As an aside, note that 70 of
         the Nation's 75 largest cities were founded on a significant body of water.)
        A requirement for green bond issuance would be that 95 percent ofthe proceeds from sale of the
         bonds must be used for the purposes outlined in this proposal and in accordance with the plans
         submitted by the qualified applicants within 3 years of issuance of the bonds. Administrative
         expenses would not be considered in meeting this 95 percent test.
        Under the proposal, a menu ofprojects would be eligible for assistance. Projects available for
         assistance would include: 1) Open Space (Including Farmlands and Wetlands); 2) Water
         Pollution; 3) Brownfield Redevelopment.
             By having two enviro-economic development initiatives in our budget, it will increase the
                          likelihood that "Expensing" will be accepted in return for dropping "green
bonds."
           The proposal would require a competition among applicants for the bonds. One of the
                          requirements for applicants would be to show regional cooperation and planning
in their                               applications.
                                                                     Automated Records ~1anagement System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
            Will benefit wealthy people? The parks, open spaces, green ways, bike paths, etc. will be
    built                  throughout cities, benefiting everyone. Brownfields, are predominantly located
    in downtown and              distressed communities, not the suburbs.
