  Here's the data and analysis we've pulled together so far.   What do you
  think?

  We are getting USDA and CEA to do more analysis on these trends and to
  develop more detailed policy options.   Some policies we can do through
  regulation, but we will need "savers" enacted elsewhere in USDA to pay for
  them, so I'm reaching out to the Ag folks to see what's available.  ================

                   What is Causing Caseload Reductions in the Food Stamp Program?

    In November 1998, the Food Stamp Program served 18.6 million people. The number of people
    receiving food stamps fell by over 9 million people, a drop of one third, since March 1994. Part
    of this drop is due to the strength of the economy and the success of welfare reform. Part of the
    drop is due to new restrictions on the participation of certain legal immigrants and able-bodied
    unemployed adults without dependents. However, other factors may also be at work. Between
    1995 and 1997, food stamp participation fell five times as fast as poverty, suggesting that many
    poor families have left the program despite their continuing eligibility. While the program is
    available to households with gross incomes of up to 130 percent of poverty, 91 percent of
    program participants have income below the poverty level.

    1. Who is Leaving the Food Stamp Program?

    As shown in the table below, the largest percentage declines in food stamp receipt were in the
    two groups whose eligibility for benefits was curtailed by the 1996 law, legal immigrants and
    childless unemployed adults, which declined by 54 and 44 percent respectively. However,
    because these groups make up only a small percent of the overall food stamp caseload, their
    decline was only responsible for 20 percent of the overall caseload decline from 1994 to 1997.
    (1997 is the most recent year for which we have food stamp caseload data by subgroup, although
    we have overall data for 1998 as shown below.)

    The bulk of the caseload changes comes from AFDC/TANF recipients, who make up
    approximately 43 percent of the food stamp caseload. Between 1994-1997, this group
    experienced a 27 percent decrease in participation, which caused 60 percent of the entire
    caseload reduction between 1994-1997.

2. How does the AFDCITANF caseload decline compare to that in food stamps?

 1994 -1997       2,853,000          -20%                5,931,000       -21%

 1994 -1998       6,321,000          -44%                9,282,516       -33%


Historically, food stamp caseloads are usually about twice as high as AFDC/TANF caseloads,
reflecting the broader eligibility rules for food stamps. AFDC caseloads, which were largely
flat from the mid-1970s through 1990, rose 27 percent between 1990 and 1994. But, between
1994 and mid-1998 they fell by 40 percent. In September, 1998, they were at their lowest since
1969.

Food stamp caseloads follow a similar trend. Participation peaked at 22 million during the
1983 recession and then fell steadily with a stronger economy until 1988. From 1988 to 1994,
participation increased by 9.5 million, a 52 percent increase. From 1994 to 1998, food stamp
participation fell by 9.2 million, a 33 percent decrease.

3. How much of the decline can be attributed to the economy?

The relationship between the economy and food stamp participation has been fairly strong over
the last twenty years. Even when forecasters have not been able to predict AFDC caseloads
accurately on the basis on economic factors, there are still corresponding patterns of rise and fall
in unemployment and the food stamp caseload. But even though economic factors are
important, they are not the entire story. There have been periods where food stamp case load
trends varied significantly from unemployment rates.

The unemployment rate has fallen from 6.6 percent in 1994 to 4.4 percent in 1999. Previously
developed models of the relationship between the economy and food stamp participation
indicate that economic trends since 1994 could account for anywhere from 28 to 45 percent of
the change in food stamp participation.

4. How are specific food stamp eligibility changes affecting the food stamp caseload?

At least 20 percent ofthe decline between 1994-1997 came from two subgroups directly
affected by PRWORA. Participation of legal immigrants declined 54 percent between
1994-1997, although most legal immigrants remained eligible through mid-1997, and reflected
14 percent of the entire caseload's decline. Changes in BBA and last year's Agricultural
Research Act may have an effect on these numbers as certain groups of legal immigrants
become eligible for food stamps. The group of childless unemployed adults without
dependents made up 8 percent of the decline in the entire food stamp caseload, as the subgroup

                                                 -2-
                           Hex-Dump Conversion

registered a 44 percent decline between 1994-1997. Most able-bodied, nonworking childless
adults are limited to three months of food stamp benefits in any 36-month period.

While the declines from these two subgroups total 22 percent of the entire caseload reductions
between 1994-1997, some of these declines, as with other populations, are likely to be due to
improvements in the economy. A 28 to 45 percent decline could mean that 6 to 10 percent of
the 22 percent would be due to the economy.

5. What effect do other welfare reform changes have on the food stamp caseload?

Historically, the Food Stamp Program has been closely coordinated in local offices with cash
assistance programs and the vast majority of the AFDC/TANF recipients were also receiving
food stamps. In fact, as shown in the table below, individuals receiving cash assistance have
historically been almost twice as likely to receive food stamps than families with eamings who
were eligible for food stamps.

        Households with children                    85.8
                                                     %

SIPP,1994


Thus, one reason for declines in food stamp participation may be that million of individuals
moved from cash assistance, where they were nearly certain to receive food stamps, to the
workforce, where they are half as likely to receive assistance even though still eligible. In that
case, we may want to focus our efforts on ensuring the food stamp program does a better job of
serving working families. Recent studies of people leaving the welfare rolls show that between
45 and 65 percent are receiving food stamps once they leave the welfare rolls.

6. What might all this information tell us?

Combining the infonnation we have on caseload changes, the estimated economic effects on
caseloads, and the take-up rates of individuals based on earnings we are able to explain 78
percent of the caseload reductions from 1994-1997. Of the 3.6 million individuals who left the
food stamp rolls, 1.6 million or 45 percent could be attributed to economic influences. Of the
2.9 million who left TANF during this period, only 59 percent are expected to continue
receiving food stamps if historical trends continue, meaning 1.2 million may not received food
stamps although they may be eligible. Combining the economic effect on the caseload and what
we know about the likelihood of participation for individuals based on earnings, we can account
for 2.8 million of the actual 3.6 million decrease. However, because those who left TANF may
have done so because of opportunities created by the growing economy, it may not be fair to add
these two effects together. We have USDA and CEA examining this and related questions.

7. What factors contribute to nonparticipation?

Reasons why working families are less likely to receive food stamps include:

      Insufficient or incorrect information about the program. Working-poor families
       with children often do not know about their eligibility for food stamps given that many
       such families are not eligible for cash assistance. Lack of accurate program infonnation
       is also prevalent among illiterate and non-English speaking individuals.

                        Hex-Dump Conversion


      Problems of Program access and administrative difficulties with the application
       process. Historically, participation rates are often lower among rural and elderly
       populations because of physical access and transportation barriers. However, recent
       reports, similar to the illegal NYC access situation, have created questions whether
       wide-spread diversion or discouragement of food stamp participation is taking place on a
       broader level. Moreover, working families need to follow somewhat cumbersome
       procedures to report their earning to the food stamp office and it is often difficult for
       individuals who are working to get to the office during open hours.

      Small size of the benefit or lack of desire for benefits. As an individual's or
       household's income rises the potential food stamp benefit declines. At some point,
       eligible individuals may decide the small amount ofthe benefit is worth less than the
       cost of applying. For example, the monthly food stamp allotment for a family of three
       with $300 weekly income and $500 monthly rent is $40. Other people forgo benefits
       regardless of the amount because of the stigma associated with receiving or using Food
       Stamps. The increasing use ofEBT could decrease this stigma in the future as the
       transaction will be similar to credit card use.

8. Possible proposals

Possible proposals for making food stamps work better for working families include:

      Car Ownership. States realize that to successfully seek and retain ajob, in most areas
       of the country people must now own a reliable vehicle. The majority of state T ANF
       programs allow ownership of one car without regard to value, or have a vehicle value
       limit in line with reasonable local used car values. However, the Food Stamp Program
       imposes a car value limit of$4,650 once a recipient is no longer receiving TANF
       assistance. In some instances, families who leave TANF yet need to continue food
       stamp participation often find that their car now prevents them from being eligible for
       food stamps.

      Reporting and Verifying Information. Because of the flexibility they have to shape
       their TANF programs, many states have simplified much of the eligibility and reporting
       process. They have reduced reporting requirements and made definitions of income
       simpler. But food stamp polices require in-person recertification interviews as often as
       every three months. Food stamp rules also require reporting of nearly every change in
       wage amounts, which often fluctuate substantially over short periods. We are
       discussing USDA a proposal to administratively allow six-month certification periods as
       opposed to three -month certification periods and allow working families to submit a
       complete report every three months but not require the families to report routine changes

   Error Rates. Under the Food Stamp program, states must meet certain payment
    accuracy rates in order to avoid penalties. These rates require the family to predict
    extremely accurately future earnings which is difficult for hourly employees. The result
    is that as individuals on T ANF move into jobs, state error rates increase, providing states
    with disincentives to serve these families. We are discussing another proposal with
    USDA to administratively raise the tolerance for excluding small dollar errors from
    $5.00 to $10.00. Only those overissuances to eligible households which exceed the
    $10.00 tolerance figure would be reported and coded in the completion of quality control
    revIews.
