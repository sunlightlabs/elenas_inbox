                               TALKING POINTS
                        ST ATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS

                                  January 26, 1998

    THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS A CONCRETE PLAN OF ACTION
          THAT IDENTIFIES OUR PRIORITIES AND APPROACHES TO KEY ISSUES


   We have a unique moment in time to prepare America for the 21st Century. Under
    President Clinton's leadership, America has achieved an unprecedented period of
    peace and prosperity:
           -- the strongest economy in a generation;
           -- the first balanced budget in a generation;
           -- crime rates at their lowest levels in 24 years;
           -- welfare rolls down by 4.3 million people;
           -- unemployment at its lowest level in more than two decades;
           -- deficit cut by more than 90 percent;
           -- unrivaled world leadership.

   This is an opportunity for action. The President's State of the Union address will
    challenge us to use this unique moment in time as an opportunity to prepare for the
    next century. It builds on the new kind of government President Clinton is creating
    -- a leaner, more flexible government. One that does not try to do everything. One
    that gives Americans the tools and conditions needed to make the most of their own
    lives.

   At the center of President Clinton's vision for a stronger America are three goals:
           -- an economy that honors opportunity;
           -- a society rooted in responsibility;
           -- and, a nation that lives as a community.

         HERE IS HOW THESE GOALS FIT INTO PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISION OF
                   A STRONGER AMERICA IN THE 21ST CENTURY:


    An Economy that offers more opportunity. The President will outline a plan for
     building a stronger, more prosperous America. Central to his strategy is:

          Driving the budget deficit down to O. During the first 5 years -- by making
           tough choices and fiscally responsible policies -- President Clinton took the
           nation's budget deficit down from $290 billion to $23 billion. This year,
           President Clinton will make history and give the American people their first
           balanced budget in 30 years.

          Reserving any budget surplus until Social Security is reformed. President
           Clinton is deeply committed to ensuring that Social Security remain a viable,
                                                                           cis Management System
                                                            Automated Recor .
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
                century. That is why he is calling on Congress to secure Social Security for
                future generations as a first priority.

               Investing in the American people through education and training. Education
                is the key to opportunity. Tomorrow, President Clinton will ask us to make
                our public elementary and secondary schools the best in the world -- by
                raising standards, raising expectations and raising accountability. He will
                call for:
                -- voluntary national testing;
                -- 100,000 new teachers in grades 1-3;
                -- a School Construction Tax Cut to help rebuild, modernize, and build new
                schools;
                -- a mentoring program;
                -- continued college access expansion, so that every American who wants to
                                              can go to college.

               Tearing down trade barriers to open new markets for American products
                and workers. The President's plan seeks to renew his negotiating auth'ority
                to open even more foreign markets to American goods and services. When
                countries hurt by economic instability are willing to undertake serious efforts
                to put their own economic houses in order, the President's plan calls for
                responsible action to give them a chance to implement their reforms. It also
                includes initiatives to enable all Americans to share in the prosperity of the
                global marketplace. Building on the funding for training we have provided
                to dislocated workers, the President will. challenge Congress to pass the GI
                Bill for Workers to give workers a simple grant so they can move more
                quickly to newer, better jobs.

       A Society that Acts Responsibly: The President is intent on helping create a
        society that acts responsibly. To enforce this commitment, the President's plan will:

                 Continue moving people from welfare to work. Challenge thousands
                  more businesses to join the 3000 companies already in our
                  welfare-to-work partnership.

                 Health Care Consumer Bill of Rights. The President called on Congress
                  to pass federally enforceable consumer health care protections before it
                  adjourns this year. This Health Care Bill of Rights should contain a
                  range of protections, including guaranteed access to needed health care
                  specialists to ensure that patients are provided appropriate high quality
                  care and access to emergency room services when and where they need it.

                 Access to affordable. quality health care. Providing new options for
                  Americans ages 55 to 65 to obtain Health Insurance, including
                  opportunities to buy into Medicare.

                 An historic child care initiative. To improve child care for America's
                  working families the President is proposing approximately $20 billion
                  over five years for child care, including elements to help working families
            the safety and quality of care, and promote early learning.
           Fighting juvenile crime and drugs. With murder, robbery, assault and
            burglary down all across the nation, President Clinton is calling for a
            special focus on addressing juvenile crime -- providing more resources to
            crack down on gangs, guns, and drugs. When coordinated with the
            support provided by the largest anti-drug budget in history and with the
            outstanding leadership General McCaffery brings to our national drug
            policy, these new efforts are sure to keep drug use on decline.

            Ensure our commitment to world leadership. The President is committed
             to keeping America strong by maintaining our role as the world's
             indispensable nation. This incudes:

             -- remaining a force for peace throughout the world;
             -- moving strongly against new threats to our security;
          -- reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction.

    America's communities by:

           Investing in our cities, giving them the tools and opportunities they need
            to continue an urban renaissance. President Clinton firmly believes that
            the best community development program, the best anti-poverty program,
            and the best jobs program is a growing economy. The President's plan
            helps our inner cities by:
            -- helping bring private enterprise into the inner city;
            -- increasing funding for empowerment zones;
            -- increasing funding for community development banks, to spur more
            investment and loans;

            more innovative ways to continue cleaning the environment while keeping
            the economy strong.

           Helping the country become One America for the 21st Century. The goal
            of the President's Initiative on Race is to create a more just and fair
            society that underscores our shared strengths, instead of focusing on our
            differences. President Clinton is determined to continue his commitment
            with the Race Initiative in 1998 -- emphasizing that our national diversity
            is our greatest strength.

   Preparing for the Millennium. In conclusion, the President will talk of the
    importance of the Millennium and the opportunity ,it presents us to honor the past,
    and imagine the future.
