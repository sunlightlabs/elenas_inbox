                                    THE ECONOMY REMAINS ON THE RIGHT TRACK:
                                    Low UNEMPLOYMENT AND STRONG JOB GROWTH
                                                                       June 6, 1997

TODAY'S DATA SHOWS THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 24
YEARS. AND THE ECONOMY HAS CREATED 12.3 MILLION JOBS SINCE JANUAR Y 1993. THE
ECONOMY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE STRONG GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION.

 Unemployment -- At 4.8% -- Is the Lowest Since 1973.
         The April unemployment rate reached 4.8 -- its 33rd consecutive month below 6 and the lowest
          monthly rate since October 1973. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5 . [Source: BLS.)
         The combined rate of unemployment and inflation has been lower under President Clinton than any other
          Administration since Lyndon Johnson was President. [Source: Based on data from BLS.)

 12.3 Million New Jobs.
         During the Clinton Administration, the economy has added 12.3 million new jobs -- a faster annual rate of
          job growth (2.5 percent per year) than any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s. [Source:
          Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.)
         The economy has added 2.5 million jobs over the past year.

   Strong Private-Sector Job Growth.
       Over the past year, the private sector has added 2.4 million jobs -- almost twice the private-sector jobs than
        during the entire four-year period before President Clinton took office. [Source: Based on data from BLS.)
       93 percent of the 12.3 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector. [Source: Based on
        data from BLS.)


   Turning The Corner In Basic American Industries.
       After losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous four years, 1.1 million new construction jobs have been
        added since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S Truman was
        President.
       After losing 35,000 jobs in the auto industry during the Bush years, we have 100,000 new auto jobs since President
        Clinton took office. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.)

LAST WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT THE ECONOMY GREW BY 5.8 PERCENT AT AN ANNUAL RATE IN THE
FIRST QUARTER -- THE FASTEST IN A DECADE -- WHILE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN LOW:


EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG:
   Fortune, 6/9/97: "Business is booming, inflation is falling, jobs are plentiful, and American industry is way out
    in front. The U.S. economy is stronger than it's ever been before."

 Allen Sinai, one of America's top economic forecasters, 4/30/97: "Job growth is good. Real income is rising.
    Sentiment is high. Unemployment is the lowest in years. Times are good for American consumers."

 Mickey Levy, chief economist, NationsBank, 2/1/97: "It's really the best of all worlds. Growth at a healthy pace,
    but with the economy not overheating and continued very favorable news on inflation."
