Question:

     Why does the budget increase welfare spending for immigrants? Doesn't this run
      counter to the welfare reform bill that the President signed less than two years ago?

Answer:

     When the President signed the welfare reform bill, he criticized the cuts to benefits for
      legal immigrants and said they had nothing to do with moving people from welfare to
      work. Last year, the President's budget addressed benefit restrictions in the SSI and
      Medicaid programs. The President and Congress ultimately restored SSI and Medicaid
      benefits for hundreds of thousands oflegal immigrants. This year, the President's FY
      1999 budget proposes to restore Food Stamps to vulnerable groups of immigrants and
      provide States the option to provide health assistance to immigrant children at a cost of
      $2.7 billion over five years.

     The budget would expand access to Food Stamps for families with children, people with
      disabilities, the elderly, refugees and asylees. Any immigrant who has a legally binding
      affidavit of support from their sponsor would be ineligible for Food Stamps unless the
      sponsor became destitute. When support is unavailable from an immigrant's sponsor,
      the nation should provide a safety net for vulnerable groups of immigrants who are legal,
      permanent residents of our country.

     The budget also proposes to give States the option to provide Medicaid and CHIP to
      immigrant children, without regard to when they entered the country. This policy will
      give low-income, vulnerable children access to medical services.

Additional:

     The Administration'.s proposal costs $2.7 billion over five years ($2.43 billion in Food
      Stamps and $0.23 billion in Medicaid). It would restore Food Stamps to 730,000
      immigrants in FY 1999. The budget restores benefits to four groups: 1) Families with
      children without regard to date of entry. For immigrants with a legally binding affidavit
      of support from their sponsor, the sponsor's income would be deemed until citizenship;
      2) Elderly (age 65 and older) and persons with disabilities who entered before welfare
      reform was enacted; 3) Refugees and asylees have their current law exemption extended
      from 5 to 7 years; and 4) Hmong refugees from Laos. The provisions for the elderly,
      disabled, refugees and asylees parallel those for SSI and Medicaid in the BBA (see
      below).

     The Administration's health care proposal would give States the option to provide
      Medicaid and CHIP to immigrant children. The Budget provides $0.23 billion in
      Medicaid for this purpose and would allow states to cover immigrant children under their

                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

   The SSA restored $11.5 billion (CSO estimate) in SSI and Medicaid benefits to
    immigrants currently receiving SSI and those who entered the country before enactment
    of welfare reform and become disabled in the future. The SBA also extended the
    exemption for refugees and asylees from 5 to 7 years for purposes of SSI and Medicaid.

                              REFUGEE ELIGIBILITY EXTENSION

    Question:

    What accounts for the high welfare utilization rates among refugees?

    Answer:

    ~      By definition, refugees and asylees are individuals who come to our country to escape
           persecution in their country of origin. These individuals have generally experienced war
           or other violent trauma requiring medical and income assistance. They often need more
           time to put their lives together and become self-supporting than other legal immigrants
           do.

           About one-half of refugees speak little or no English at arrival; only about one-tenth
           speak English fluently.

           Therefore, we believe refugees and asylees need a longer eligibility period for assistance
           than other qualified aliens because of the unique circumstances that bring refugees and
           asylees to the U.S.

           Under the President's proposal, refugees and asylees would get an additional two years of
           eligibility, to provide additional time to enable them to naturalize or to achieve stable
           self-support. The President's budget proposal would extend refugees' eligibility for
           Food Stamps benefits from 5 to 7 years.

           The longer time period is particularly important because more recent refugee populations
           have included larger numbers of older and elderly individuals who require a longer time
           to adjust.

          This is the same exclusion that was provided to refugees, asylees and those whose
           deportation has been withheld for the SSI and Medicaid programs in last year's Balanced
           Budget Act.

           Finally, refugees are not even eligible to mmlY for naturalization until they are near the
           end of their 5 years residence. Since the processing time for naturalization applications
           is now about 1 year, this extension from 5 to 7 years is necessary to physically permit
           refugees to comply with INS procedures without being denied crucial services during the
           interim.

                                 BENEFITS FOR IMMIGRANTS
                               HOLDING SPONSORS RESPONSIBLE

     Question:

     Why shouldn't immigrants be taken care of by the sponsors who agreed to take care of them?

     Answer:

           We agree that sponsors need to be held responsible and accountable. The
            Administration supported the new law requiring all family-based and some
            employment-based immigrants to have legally binding affidavits of support, and we
            implemented the provision in the fall of 1997.

           The Administration's proposal requires that all immigrants who have a legally binding
            affidavit of support from their sponsor will have the income of their sponsor assigned to
            them for purposes of determining eligibility for Food Stamps.

           However, nearly all legal immigrants now in the U.S. either have sponsors who are not
            legally obliged to support them or have no sponsors at all. Sponsors of immigrants who
            arrived in the past signed affidavits of support that are not legally binding and therefore
            do not obligate them to provide support or to reimburse for public assistance. An INS
            estimates of all FY 1994 non-refugee immigrants found that nearly half--or 44
            percent--did not have sponsors.

           Additional support is therefore needed for immigrants who have no legally-binding
            affidavit of support or no sponsor in the first place.
                          FEDERAL VERSUS STATE ACTION

Question:

     GAO reports that 20 States provided or plan to provide legal immigrants with
      state-funded food stamps assistance or other food assistance. GAO estimates that these
      State efforts will reach one quarter of the immigrants who were denied Food Stamps by
      the welfare reform restrictions. Given these State efforts, why should the Federal
      government change its policy?

Answer:

     The budget would expand access to Food Stamps for families with children, people with
      disabilities, the elderly, refugees and asylees. All of these groups deserve access to food
      assistance regardless of where they reside in our country. The strong State response to
      this problem is evidence that the public does not support denying Food Stamps to
      vulnerable groups of legal immigrants. However, it does not substitute for a permanent
      national policy. In addition, States are serving only one-quarter of the individuals who
      lost benefits. There are many more individuals who are not receiving assistance from
      States.

     Many states have chosen to provide benefits to only certain limited groups (i.e., elderly or
      disabled). The duration of the state efforts is unclear. Some states described the
      measures as only interim actions until Congress addresses the issue. It is not clear that
      States would continue to provide these benefits if an economic recession created a
      shortfall in State budgets.

Additional:

     The FY 1997 Supplemental Appropriation Act included a provision to allow States to
      purchase Food Stamps from the Federal government to provide benefits to individuals
      who lost food assistance due to the 1996 welfare reform law.

       States generally use the Food Stamp Program's infrastructure to provide benefits to
      . immigrants and reimburse the Federal government for the costs. States providing or
        planning to provide assistance through purchasing Food Stamps or through other
        programs include California, Florida, New York, Texas, New Jersey, Massachusetts,
        Maryland, Nebraska, Rhode Island, Washington, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine,
        Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and West
        Virginia.
