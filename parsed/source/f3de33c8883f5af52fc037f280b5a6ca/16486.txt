TEXT:
Bob Shireman tells me that Jake Siewart has given oral guidance to the
Press office on this to the effect that the President's veto threat letter
was consistent with his longstanding policy on private school vouchers and
that the letter to the Republican leadership speaks for itself.    We may
want to give more guidance in case the press office gets follow-on
questions.  Please review and see if you think we should pass this along.
I will fax you a copy of the President's letter.

Thanks.==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ====================

                         Press Guidance on the Coverdell Amendment


Background

The Coverdell Amendment would have allowed parents to withdraw funds from an IRA tax-free
to pay for for tuition at public, private, or sectarian elementary and secondary schools. In
addition to tuition, the amendment would have provided a tax subsidy for tutoring, books and
supplies, equipment, transportation and supplementary expenses related to education.

The provision was removed from the budget package at the Administration's insistence, and last
night the President wrote the Republican leadership indicating that he "would veto any tax
package that would undermine public education by providing tax benefits for private and
parochial school expenses."

Suggested Response

Q:     Today Sen. Coverdell held a press conference denouncing the President's threat to veto
       his proposal to provide tax benefits for K-12 schooling, including private and parochial
       schools. Given how hard the President pushed for tax benefits for postsecondary
       education, how can you explain the President's position?


A:            This is consistent with the President's long-standing position on private school
              vouchers. As the President's letter indicated, the Coverdell provision would have
              undermined public education.

             The Coverdell Amendment would have little practical benefit for families with
              students in public elementary and secondary schools, where the vast majority of
              students attend, and which do not charge tuition. Instead, these tax provisions
              would have primarily subsidized private school tuition.

             The revenue lost from the amendment could be much better spent on efforts to
              improve our public schools, such as repairing crumbling buildings.

             The amendment would have covered almost any expense even remotely connected
              to the costs of K-12 education, including high-priced running shoes, cellular
              phones, and camcorders. This would create a very real "loophole" for using
              funds in ways that were not intended and have opened the door to abuse.
