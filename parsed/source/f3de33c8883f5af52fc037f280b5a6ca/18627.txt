             ALLOCATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN STATE PROGRAMS

     The President's budget proposes a new method of allocating administrative costs that shifts some
     costs from the capped TANF grants to Medicaid and Food Stamps without increasing Federal
     spending. Under current practice, common administrative costs are to be paid for by TANF or
     absorbed by the States and not charged to Medicaid or Food Stamps. To ensure that Federal
     Medicaid and Food Stamps spending does not rise above projected spending without this cost
     shift, the budget would adjust the matching rate for administrative costs from 50 to 47 percent.

           No overall reduction in Federal administrative spending. This proposal does not
            "cut" Federal administrative support for States. The proposal simply changes the way
            that such costs are matched, moving some of the common administrative costs that would
            have been borne by the States or T ANF to the open-ended Medicaid and Food Stamps
            programs while lowering the Medicaid and Food Stamps matching rate. Thus, States
            will receive the same amount of Federal matching funds they would have received under
            previous cost allocation policies. States will still receive their entire T ANF block grant,
            with cost allocation freeing up limited T ANF resources and State funds for other uses.

           No effect on children's health outreach funding. The President's budget also
            proposes to allow States to draw down extra Federal matching from a special fund so that
            the matching rate for children's health outreach will be 90 percent up to a limit. In fact,
            the President's budget gives States additional resources and flexibility for outreach.

     BACKGROUND

           Before welfare reform, States charged most common administrative costs of AFDC,
            Medicaid and Food Stamps to their AFDC budget. Because the matching rate for all of
            these open-ended programs was the same, States would receive the same Federal
            matching funds regardless of which program paid for these common costs.

           However, welfare reform has changed this equilibrium. T ANF consolidated cash
            assistance, related programs, and administrative expenditures into a fixed block grant.
            Under current policy, all common administrative costs have to be absorbed within the
            block grant (within certain limits on administrative expenses) or paid by the States.
            Many States have sought to allocate some of the common administrative costs to
            Medicaid and Food Stamps.

           Both OMB and CBO baselines include Federal cost increases from States' shifting
            administrative costs from the capped TANF block grant to the open-ended Food Stamp
            and Medicaid programs. Conservative estimates suggest that this will increase Federal
            costs by at least $3 billion over the next five years in the baseline.

           The budget proposes to recognize the new structure and to change allocation practices,
            and adjusts the administrative matching rate in Food Stamps and Medicaid from 50
            percent to 47 percent to account for this cost shift from TANF. The total savings from
            the matching rate change equals the total cost increases resulting from the new cost
            allocation practices. In the aggregate, this means that States will receive the same
            amount of funding they would have received under the previous cost allocation policy.
