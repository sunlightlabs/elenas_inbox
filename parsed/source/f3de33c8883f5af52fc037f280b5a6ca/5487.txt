    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:          BRUCE REED
                   MIKE COHEN

    SUBJECT:       Education Opportunity Zones

             This initiative, which you discussed in your Town Hall meeting earlier this week, would
    designate from 20 to 40 urban and rural school districts as Education Opportunity Zones.
    Education Opportunity Zones would have a strong focus on standards, accountability, and
    performance. High-poverty urban and rural school districts would be eligible for additional
    Federal funding, under this proposal, if(l) they adopt tough reform measures --like those in
    Chicago -- that.make administrators, principals, teachers, and students accountable for success or
    failure, and (2) in time, show real improvements in student achievement. As proposed, the
    initiative would cost $250 million in FY 99 ($1.1 billion over five years).

             The purpose of this initiative is to demonstrate that a serious approach to high standards
    can work. Therefore, funds would be targeted to school systems that have already begun to
    make progress in raising student achievement, at least in some low-income portions of the
    district, or that can show that they have begun to put into place effective reform policies, so that
    local efforts can be expanded or accelerated.

    Conditions and Purposes of Funding

           To receive funds, local school districts would have to demonstrate how they will:

                  provide students and parents with expanded choice within public education;

                  hold schools accountable for helping students reach high academic standards,
                   including rewarding schools that succeed and intervening in schools that failto
                   make progress;

                  hold teachers and principals accountable for quality, including rewarding
                   outstanding teachers, and fairly and quickly removing ineffective teachers;

                  require students to meet academic standards at key transition points in their
                   academic careers -- i.e., ending social promotions.

           School districts could use Education Opportunity Zone funds to:

                  provide extra help to students who need it to meet challenging standards, through
                   after-school or Saturday tutoring programs and/or summer school;

                                                                                   Automatccl R,'cQrds ~!anagement System
                                                                                   Hex텱ump Conversion


                        provide bonuses to schools that make significant gains in student achievement;

                        turn around failing schools by implementing proven reform models, providing
                         intensive teacher training, building stronger partnerships between schools and
                         parents, businesses, and community-based organizations, or closing down failing
                         schools and reopening them as charter schools.

                        provide needed training to teachers and principals; reward outstanding teachers by
                         helping them earn certification as master teachers from the National Board for
                         Professional Teaching standards and providing them with financial bonuses when
                         they do; and implement programs to identify low performing teachers, assist them
                         to improve, and remove them if they fail to do so.

          Funding Levels

                 As proposed, the Department of Education would award 3-year competitive grants to
          10-20 urban school districts and 10-20 rural school districts or consortia (including districts
          serving Native American students) selected as Education Opportunity Zones. Each urban
          Education Opportunity Zone would receive approximately $10-25 million in its first year, and
          each rural zone would receive from $500,000 to $5 million (for consortia).

                 The stream of federal support under these grants would be structured so as to ensure that
          reforms can be sustained over the long term. Continued support in years 4 and 5 would be
          contingent upon demonstrated success in raising student achievement and willingness to work
          with similar districts to help them replicate successful reforms. A total of $16 million would be
          available each year for national activities, such as providing technical assistance, documenting
          successes, and disseminating lessons learned to urban and rural communities across the U.S.


          Outstanding Issues

                  We are still working with other offices and the Department of Education on some
          remaining issues with this initiative. First, we are developing a component that would give
          Education Opportunity Zones greater flexibility in the use of other federal education funds as
          long as they continue to meet agreed-upon performance goals. Local'districts would also be
          required to give their own schools expanded flexibility, in return for accountability for results.
          In addition, we are exploring whether we could fund this initiative under existing authority,
          rather than seek new legislative authorization.
