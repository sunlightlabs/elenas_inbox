MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:       SECRETARY HERMAN'S REPORT ON WELFARE-TO-WORK

        The attached memo from Secretary Herman provides a good report on her recent
welfare-to-work tour and reflects her strong personal commitment to this issue. In her visits to
10 cities she talked with a wide range of people, including former recipients. She found plenty of
evidence that we're on the right track-- people want to work and are proud to be working. At the
same time, she identified challenges facing individuals moving from welfare to work and
proposes steps to overcome these.
       Remove the stigma faced by former welfare recipients by shattering the myths about
        welfare, referring to former welfare recipients as "new workers", and making sure they
        receive worker protections.
       Continue attracting private sector employers by building on the work of the Welfare to
        Work Partnership and making sure they know about tax incentives. Employers and new
        workers were not well-informed about employer incentives or the EITC.
       Transportation, child care and affordable housing continue to be barriers to getting and
        keeping a job, which pending administration proposals and the WtW grants will help
        address. The smooth transition from welfare to work is also hampered by administrative
        glitches in some places.
       Encourage life long learning and skill building to ensure that people can advance in the
        workforce. (She heard that teen-age mothers in Milwaukee were forced to quit high
        school to pursue a job. It is our understanding that state policy follows the federal
        requirement that minor parents without a diploma must stay in school. Young parents
        between 18 and 20 are expected to prepare for work and may combine education with
        work.)
       Raise the earnings potential of fathers to ensure support from both parents.

Secretary Herman proposes 4 next steps:
1.      Hold quarterly Cabinet level welfare-to-work meetings to enhance coordination among
       federal agencies. These would build on ongoing interagency staff-level meetings
       convened by DPC.
2.     Encourage other Cabinet members, as well as state and local leaders, to go out and
       observe first hand how things are going.
3.     Challenge labor, community, and faith-based organizations to do even more, building on
       the Vice President's coalition.
4.     Convene an "Opportunity Summit" bringing together Cabinet members, governors, local
       officials, practitioners, labor, CBOs and welfare recipients to explore how to address the
       remaining challenges in making welfare-to-work a success. This is modeled after an
       event you convened as Governor.
