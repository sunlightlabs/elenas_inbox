The Ways and Means Subcommittee's proposed amendment to the welfare law clearly violates
the negotiated, bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a minimal safety net for disabled
legal immigrants. The Subcommittee's proposal would restore SSI and Medicaid benefits only
to immigrants (both the disabled and non-disabled elderly) already receiving benefits prior to
August 23, 1996; by contrast, the bipartisan budget agreement policy restores SSI and Medicaid
benefits to any immigrant in the country as of that date who is or becomes disabled. The budget
agreement targets assistance to the most vulnerable individuals.

      THE WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL IGNORES
       VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS WHO BECOME DISABLED AFTER AUGUST
       22,1996: This proposal abandons many legal immigrants who were in the U.S. when
       the welfare law was signed but become severely disabled after that date. In contrast, the
       bipartisan budget agreement protects these immigrants.

      BY THE YEAR 2000, THE WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL
       WOULD PROTECT 75,000 FEWER IMMIGRANTS THAN THE BUDET
       AGREEMENT. This number grows to 125,000 by the year 2007 ..

       Example: A legal immigrant family entered the country 3 years ago. Both the father and
       mother have worked full-time since then, and have an annual income of about $25,000,
       but neither job provides health insurance for themselves or the family. Their 5 year-old
       son becomes severely disabled in a car accident next year. Under the budget agreement,
       he would be eligible for SSI and Medicaid; under the Ways and Means Subcommittee's
       proposal he would be denied SSI -- and potentially denied Medicaid. (this example
       assumes the parents would rapidly "spend-down" due to hospital bills and become
       income-eligible for SSI and Medicaid.)

The Administration also strongly opposes the Subcommittee's initial proposal not to restore
benefits for SSI beneficiaries whose sponsors have income over 150% of the poverty level.
However, it appears that it has decided to drop this proposal. This proposal, which was not
contemplated by the bipartisan budget agreement, would cut off 100,000 severely disabled
immigrants who would receive benefits under the budget agreement, and would be unfair to
families of limited means.

Question:     Doesn't the Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal treat the elderly better than
              the Administration's proposal, while the Administration's policy favors the
              disabled? Isn't this really a wash?

Answer:       The parties to the budget agreement already made the decision about where
              limited resources should be targeted. The agreement explicitly states the policy
              of restoring SSI and Medicaid eligibility to immigrants who are or become
              disabled and who are in the U.S. as of August 22, 1996. This is one of the
              specific policies agreed to between the President and the Congressional

                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
The Administration believes that the budget agreement appropriately targets the
most vulnerable individuals. It provides for all immigrants in the country when
the welfare law was signed who have suffered -- or may suffer in the future -- a
disabling accident or illness. At the same time, the agreement will result in
restoring benefits to a full 80% of the caseload as of August 22, 1996 -- including
all of the disabled as well as the two-thirds of the elderly caseload who would
meet the disability eligibility requirements needed to retain coverage.

We are pleased that the Ways and Means subcommittee has included in its mark a $3 billion
welfare to work proposal that meets many of the Administration's priorities:

      It provides additional funds for jobs where they're needed most: to help long term
       recipients in high unemploymentlhigh poverty areas;
      It directs funds to cities and local governments (Elena please note: Bruce made the Shaw
       letter "local communities" instead of "cities and local governments", but Cynthia thinks
       it's good to keep the word "cities" in talking points) with large numbers of poor people;
      It awards some funds on a competitive basis, assuring the best use for scarce resources;
      It provides communities with appropriate flexibility to use the funds to create succesful
       job placement and creation programs.

We are pleased that Congressman Shaw was willing to work in a bipartisan basis to incorporate
many of the Administration's priorities. We continue to urge the Committee to provide
additional incentives for success through performance bonuses. We are deeply disappointed at
the subcommittee draft's lack of adequate worker protections and non-displacement provisions,
and urge the subcommittee to to add stronger language to better protect against worker
displacement.

The President proposed a $3 billion welfare to work program last fall and fought to have it
included in the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. A centerpiece of the President's
second-term agenda, the proposal will help move one million adults from welfare to work by the
year 2000.

The Labor Department has concluded that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) applies to
welfare recipients in workfare or other subsidized employment programs in the same way
as that law applies to all other employees. This means that many, if not most, welfare
recipients in these programs will receive at least the minimum wage for their work
activities.

     States are able to meet the work requirements of the welfare law not only by putting
      recipients in workfare, but also by placing people in private sector jobs (where the
      minimum wage already applies).

     With both cash assistance and food stamps counting toward the minimum wage, very few
      states will have to increase their assistance payments. In fact every state but one
      (Mississippi) can comply with the welfare law's current work requirements (now 20
      hours per week for a welfare recipient) and pay minimum wage without increasing their
      current benefit level for a family of three.

     The Treasury Department is still exploring how the tax laws apply to welfare recipients in
      workfare programs. We hope to be able to give states an answer to that question very
      shortly.

The Administration strongly opposes the Ways and Means Subcommittee's provision on
the minimum wage and welfare work requirements.

     The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources proposes to amend the
      welfare law so that welfare recipients engaged in workfare would not be employees for
      the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act. It would permit states to count child care,
      Medicaid, and housing benefits in their calculation of the minimum wage, and to meet the
      work requirements by counting hours engaged in job search, education, and training
      beyond those currently allowed by the welfare law.

     This Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal would undermine the fundamental goals
      of welfare reform. The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work
      must work -- and that those who work should earn the minimum wage, whether they are
      coming off of welfare or not. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal does
      not meet this test.

     This Subcommittee proposal is also beyond the scope of the budget agreement between
      the White House and Congress and should therefore not be included in the reconciliation
      bill.

     The Administration stands ready to work with Congress and states to discuss alternative
      proposals that do not undermine the minimum wage or weaken the law's work
      requirements.
