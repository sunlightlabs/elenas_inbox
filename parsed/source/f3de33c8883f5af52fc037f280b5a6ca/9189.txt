                Senate Rejects Extreme House Republican Labor-HHS Bill
                                                September 1, 1998


Last year, President Clinton delivered a bipartisan balanced budget that made critical investments in our
children, including the largest investment in children's health since Medicaid was created and tax credits to
make college more affordable. Building on that success, the President has proposed important investments to
prepare our children for the 21 st century. Instead of continuing to move forward on a bipartisan path, House
Republicans chose an extreme approach, eliminating energy assistance for low-income families and the summer
jobs program. President Clinton has repeatedly criticized the House bill and rallied bipartisan opposition.

A step forward -- Senate joins President Clinton and rejects House bill:
   Funds Low-Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP).               The House bill eliminates LIHEAP,
    denying more than five million low-income families assistance to pay for home heating and cooling
    costs. The Senate bill funds the President's budget request to help these families.

    Funds the Summer Jobs Program, which provides about one in five of the jobs for African American
    16-17 year olds. Unlike the House, which eliminated this successful program, the Senate included the
    President's request that rewards hard work and provides valuable work experience to over one-half million
    low-income youth.

   Supports Goals 2000. To move forward on raising academic standards, the President proposed a $10
    million increase for Goals 2000. The Senate funded half of that increase, in stark contrast to the $255
    million or 51 % cut in the House bill, which would have adversely affected 6,000 schools serving over 3
    million students.

   Supports effort against child labor. Unlike the House, which provided just $6 million, the Senate fully
    funds the President's request for $30 million for the International Program for the Elimination of Child
    Labor (IPEC), a proven model for eliminating forced, indentured, abusive, and hazardous labor for children
    around the world.

Progress in some other key areas, but not in others. More work needs to be done:
   Supports Title I (Education for the Disadvantaged). The House bill cuts the President's Request for Title
    I by $392 million, denying additional help to nearly 520,000 students in high-poverty communities. The
    Senate bill adds $301 million over FY 1998, but remains $91 million below the President's budget.
   Provides partial funding to prepare disadvantaged children for college. By denying all of the
    President's request of$140 million for the High Hopes program, the House bill denies more than one million
    at-risk middle school students (over five years) the mentoring and tutoring needed to raise education
    expectations and eliminate barriers to college. In contrast, the Senate provides $75 million, roughly half of
    the President's request.
   A start on education technology. The House bill cuts investments in education technology, denying
    funding to 400 school districts nationwide to provide students and teachers with access to computers.
    The Senate bill adds $39 million over FY98, but remains $98 million below the President's budget.
                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                           He".Dump Conversion
   Insufficient funds for after-school programs. The House bill reduces the President's request for the
    21st Century Community Learning Centers program by $140 million, denying approximately 425,000
    school-age children participation in before- and after-school programs. The Senate provided $15
    million more than the House but it is still $125 million below the President's requested investment.
   Does not fully fund out-of-school youth initiative. The House bill provided no funding, denying
    training and job finding help for up to 50,000 youth each year in the poorest communities. The Senate
    provided $125 million in FY99 funding, but this is still $125 million below the President's budget. For
    FYOO, the Senate provided the President's full $250 million request.
   Falls short on Hispanic education initiative. The President's Budget proposed funding increases of $212
    million for a series of programs to enhance the educational achievement of Hispanic Americans. The
    House bill reduces this request by more than $90 million, with significant decreases in the request for Adult
    Education, Bilingual Education, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Comprehensive School Reform
    Demonstrations. The Senate bill reduces the President's request by $170 million, with significant decreases
    in the programs above as well as for Migrant Education and TRIO programs.

    Fails to fund reading initiative. The Senate bill denies $260 million for the America Reads
    Challenge, denying funding to schools and communities to improve reading programs and provide
    tutors.

   Takes a step backwards on key health efforts. The Senate bill would have a devastating effect on the
    ability of the Health Care Financing Administration to manage the Medicare, Medicaid and Children's
    Health Insurance programs. Further, the Senate bill undermines the President's efforts to improve the
    public health by under funding the President's requests for demonstrations to improve racial health
    disparities, substance abuse treatment programs, health professions assistance grants, and disease prevention
    activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
