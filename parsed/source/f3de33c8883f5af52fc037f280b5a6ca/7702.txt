[Draft POTUS Letter to the Senate]
                                           May 18, 1998



        I applaud the Senate for turning to floor consideration of S.1415, comprehensive tobacco
legislation designed to reduce youth smoking introduced by Senators McCain and Hollings.
Immediate consideration and passage of this landmark legislation is critical, given that with each
passing day, 3000 teenagers will begin smoking and 1000 will die prematurely of
smoking-related illnesses as a result.

        I am pleased to endorse S.1415, as amended by Senator McCain's Manager's
Amendment. Senators McCain and Hollings have worked hard over the past few weeks to
arrive at a Manager's Amendment that would bring the bill in line with the five principles I
established last September for comprehensive tobacco legislation. These five principles include:


              Raising the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over 5 years and $1.50 a pack
               over the next ten years, with extra surcharges on companies that continue to sell to
               kids;

              Affirming the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;

              Getting companies out of the business of marketing and selling tobacco to minors;

              Promoting public health research and public health goals; and

              Protecting our tobacco faimers and their communities.

        S. 1415 as amended meets meets these five principles. I am particularly pleased that the
bill contains significant improvements which will help reduce youth smoking and protect the
public health, including tougher lookback surcharges, enhanced environmental tobacco smoke
protections, improved liability provisions, elimination of the antitrust exemption, and spending
for public health, health research, assistance for farmers, and the states, including child care and
professional teacher development. I do hope the Senate will reconsider certain provisions which
affect the sovereignty of Indian tribes. I thank the Senate Leadership for bringing this bill to the
floor in such an expeditious manner and I urge all Senators to vote for S.1415 as amended by the
Manager's Amendment, and to quickly send it to my desk for signature.
