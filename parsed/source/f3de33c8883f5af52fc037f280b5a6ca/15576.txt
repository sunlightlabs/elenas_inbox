                   FACT SHEET ON THE BUDGET AGREEMENT
                                May 16,1997


DEFICIT REDUCTION

    First balanced budget in a generation. Budget balances by 2002 -- for the first time
     since 1969.

    Finishes the job. The 1993 Economic Plan has already reduced the deficit 77%, from
     $290 billion in 1992 to an expected $67 billion this year. This budget agreement finishes
     the job, balancing the budget by 2002 -- with $204 billion in net budget savings over the
     next 5 years.

    Keeps budget balanced through 2007. The agreement will maintain budget balance
     until 2007, and save $906 billion over the next 10 years.


CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS

    Proven record on forecasts. For four years in a row, growth has been higher and the
     deficit has been lower than predicted. For example, CBO predicted growth for 1996 of
     2.0 percent and the Administration predicted 2.2 percent. Actual growth was 2.4
     percent. CBO forecast a deficit of $197 billion, and the Administration forecast a deficit
     of $211 billion. The actual deficit was $107 billion.

   Conservative assumptions. The assumptions used in this agreement are similarly
    conservative. The real growth assumption over the next 5 years (2.2 percent per year),
    for example, is lower than the Blue Chip private sector consensus (2.3 percent). It is
    intended to reflect average growth over different stages of the business cycle. Since
    1973, over several business cycles, growth has averaged 2.6 percent per year.

   80% of the $225 billion in additional CBO revenue either already assumed or used
    for deficit reduction. The majority of the $225 billion adjustment had already been
    assumed in the budget negotiations.


DISCRETIONARY SPENDING

   Budget agreement achieves 99% of the President's budget for non-defense
    discretionary spending over the next 5 years. $61 billion of savings in non-defense
    discretionary outlays over the next 5 years -- a 10% real cut by 2002. $77 billion of
    savings in defense spending over the next 5 years -- an 11 % real cut by 2002.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
TAX CUTS

    $85 billion in net tax cuts. $85 billion in net tax cuts over the next 5 years and $250
     billion in net tax cuts over the next 10 years.

    $35 billion for the President's education tax proposals. The agreement includes a
     commitment to provide roughly $35 billion over 5 years for post-secondary education,
     including a deduction and tax credit.

    Other commitments. The agreement commits the House and Senate Leadership to seek
     approval of various proposals, including:

            -- $500 per child tax credit
            -- The welfare-to-work tax credit
            -- Capital gains tax relief for home sales
            -- The Administration's EZiEC proposals
            -- Tax relief for brownfields legislation
            -- Tax relieffor FSC software
            -- Tax incentives to spur DC growth
