                                SAFE AND CLEAN ENVIRONMENT


Environmental justice and redevelopment. Issued an Executive Order on Environmental
Justice, ensuring that low income citizens and minorities do not suffer a disproportionate burden

                                          IMMIGRATION

Naturalization. Made naturalization a top priority of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in order to continue fostering legal immigration while combating illegal immigration.
Naturalized over one million individuals in 1996. The Administration continues to work to
streamline and improve the naturalization process so that eligible individuals who have played by
the rules can become full partners in America.

Responsible immigration reform. Worked to enact responsible immigration reform legislation
by properly focusing on immigration enforcement and opposing severe reductions in legal
immigration which were not consistent with pro-family, pro-worker and pro-naturalization
principles.

Defended immigrant rights. The Administration defeated legislative efforts which would have
significantly eroded health care for immigrants. The bipartisan agreement strengthened the
sponsorship requirement while preserving the basic ability of families to reunify.

    acceptable to defendants. His straightforward approach and his prodigious legal skills
    have won him the respect of opponents and colleagues alike.

    disability.

   Lee was born in 1949 in New York City. He now lives with his wife and three children
