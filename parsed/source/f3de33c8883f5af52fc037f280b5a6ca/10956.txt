                       PRESIDENT CLINTON FIGHTING
                FOR NATIVE AMERICANS IN HIS Fy2000 BUDGET
                                             February 1, 1999

The President's FY2000 budget represents a significant step forward for America, protecting Social
Security and Medicare, and putting in place critical investments in education and training, from smaller
class sizes to after-school care. The President also has made a significant commitment to helping Native
Americans, particularly in the areas of education, health care, and law enforcement.


Budget Initiatives for Native Americans:
Investing in Education and Training.
        Hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers to reduce dass size in the early grades. President Clinton
         requests $1.4 billion in his FY 2000 budget, a $200 million increase over FY 1999 funding, for his
         initiative to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size in grades 1-3 to a national average ofl8.
         This increase will enable local schools to recruit, hire, and train an additional 8,000 teachers, while
         continuing to pay for the 30,000 teachers hired with FY 1999 funds. To ensure that this initiative
         supports high-quality teaching, school districts may spend up to 15 percent of these funds for
         teacher training and other related activities. Studies show that smaller classes enable teachers to
         give personal attention to students, which leads to their getting a stronger foundation in the basic
         skills. The studies also show that minority and disadvantaged students show the greatest
         achievement gains as a result of reducing class size in the early grades.
                        $6 Million oftbe $1.4 Billion is for BIA-funded scbools. The funds can used to
                        recruit, hire and train teachers in order to reduce class size in the early grades.

         Training and Recruiting New Native American Teachers.     Only two-thirds of Native American
         students successfully complete high school --far fewer than other students. To address this
         challenge, the President is proposing $10 million to begin training and recruiting of 1000 new
         teachers for areas with high concentrations of American Indian and Alaska Native students.

         New Native American Scbool Modernization Bonds. In addition to tbe $22 billion of Scbool
         Modernization Bonds autborized in bis budget for the construction and renovation of public
         scbools, tbe President's budget includes a new component for Native American schools. The
         Secretary of Interior would be authorized to allocate $400 million in School Modernization
         Bonds ($200 million in 2000 and $200 million in 2001) to tribes or tribal organizations for the
         construction and renovation of BIA funded schools.

         BIA School Construction and Repair. Tbe President bas proposed $108 million, an 80
         percent increase over tbe FY99 enacted level, to replace and repair some of tbe 185
         BIA-funded scbools on reservations. Of these funds, $78 million will be used to assist in
         replacing older, unsafe, and dilapidated schools on reservations in accordance with a
         Congressionally-approved priority list of replacement schools and would provide for
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

         much-needed health and safety-related repairs and improvements that together comprise a
         roughly $700 million backlog. The remaining $30 million will be used to assist tribes or
         tribal organizations in issuing the bonds described above by using these funds to assure
         principal repayment.

         Strengthening BIA-Funded Schools and Colleges Serving Tribes. The budget provides $542
         million for the operation of elementary and secondary schools, tribally controlled community
         colleges, and assistance to Indian children attending public schools. This represents an increase of
         $35 million from FY99.



         Child Care Quality. $173 million to improve the quality of child care for America's working
         families and $600 million for a new Early Learning Fund to improve early childhood education and
         the quality of care for children under age five.
         Teacher Recruitment. The President will propose $35 million --up from $7.5 million last
         year --to provide scholarships to 7,000 outstanding students who commit to teaching in
         high-poverty public schools.
         Head Start. A $607 million increase to fund the President's request of up to an additional 42,000
         slots for children and keeping on track towards one million children served by 2002.
         Indian Head Start. The budget provides $147 million for Indian Head Start -- a $17 million
         increase over FY99.

Fighting Crime in Indian Country.             The President's budget included key increases for law
enforcement:

         Improves Law Enforcement in Indian Country. The budget includes $164 million, a 50
         percent increase over FY99, for the Departments of Justice and Interior for the second year of the
         President's Indian Country Law Enforcement Initiative. The initiative will improve public safety
         for the 1.4 million residents on the approximately 56 million acres of Indian lands. This funding
         will increase the number of law enforcement officers on Indian lands, provide more equipment,
         expand detention facilities, enhance juvenile crime prevention, and improve the effectiveness of
         tribal courts. Although violent crime has been declining nationally for several years, it has
         been on the rise in Indian country. At the same time, police service on Indian lands has been
         steadily shrinking. Recognizing these facts, the President made a major commitment to
         improve law enforcement in Indian country

Providing Health Care. President Clinton and Vice President Gore are committed to providing health
care to the Native American population. This budget moves forward on their vision to help realize this goal.


         Indian Health Service. The President's budget proposes $2.4 billion, an increase for the
         Indian Health Service (lHS) of$170 million or 8 percent over the FY 1999 level. This
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

        increase would enable IHS to continue expanding accessible and high-quality health care to
        its 1.4 million Native American service users. The budget enables IHS to further enhance
        current levels of direct health care services, including providing 34,000 breast cancer
        screening mammographies to Native American women between ages 50-69; creating 44 new
        dental unit teams to provide an additional 25,000 dental visits; reducing the incidence of
        complications related to chronic diseases such as diabetes through clinical monitoring and
        health promotion on life style changes; and enabling approximately 100 new
        community-based public health nurses to provide outreach activities, including home
        visitations, well-child examinations, immunizations, prenatal care, health fairs, follow-up
        visits, and missed clinical appointments.

        IHS Medicaid and Medicare Reimbursements. In addition, from FY98 to FY2000, illS expects
        to collect an additional $82 million in reimbursements due to Medicaid collections rate increases.
        Based on illS' hospital-based cost data, illS' Medicaid inpatient rates will rise by 40 percent
        between 1997 and 1999 and Medicaid outpatient rates will increase by 13 percent. illS will
        collect a total of $335 million in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements in FY2000, helping to
        bring the total illS program level to $2.8 billion.

        Indian Health Service (IHS) Contract Support Costs. Within the overall IHS increase, the
        budget continues to support Tribal self-determination by proposing a $35 million (+17%)
        increase for contract support costs, to cover the costs of existing tribal contracts and
        compacts.

        Helping to Reduce Racial Disparities in Health Status. Despite improvements in the Nation's
        overall health, continuing disparities remain in the burden of death and illness that certain minority
        groups experience. American Indian and Alaska Natives are about three times as likely to dies
        from diabetes as other Americans. To address this need, the budget includes $145 million for
        health education, prevention, and treatment services for minority populations. Working with
        minority public health providers, advocates, and other consumer representatives, CDC will
        continue a $35 million demonstration program to enable selected communities to develop
        innovative and effective approaches to address these disparities.

         Elevating the Position of the Director of IHS. The President will also continue his efforts to
         elevate the Director of illS to the position of Assistant Secretary.

Moving People from Welfare to Work and Empowering Communities. President Clinton
and Vice President Gore are committed to tapping the potential of America's urban and rural communities.
 This budget moves forward on their vision to help revitalize America's communities.

         Transportation and Housing for Families Moving From Welfare to Work. The President's
         budget contains $580 million for welfare to work housing vouchers and transportation assistance to
         help those on welfare get to work and stay employed. The President's budget provides $430
         million for 75,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers, including $144 million in new funds for
         25,000 additional vouchers. This is a 50 percent increase over the 50,000 vouchers the
         President secured last year. The vouchers will help families move closer to a new job, reduce
         a long commute, or secure more stable housing so they can perform better on the job. The
         President's budget also increases Access to Jobs transportation funding from $75 million to $150
         million, doubling the number of individuals and communities that can receive transportation
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
       assistance. This competitive grant program supports innovative state and local
       transportation solutions such as shuttles, van pools, new bus routes, and connector services to
       mass transit to help welfare recipients and other low income workers get to work..
       Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Expansion. The Administration
       requested a major expansion ofthe CDFI program to continue building a national network of
       community development banks. The final budget increases CDFI funding from $95 million in
       FY99 to $125 million in FY2000 -- a $30 million increase.
        Flexible Funding for Empowerment Zones. In January 1999, the Administration
       announced 20 new Empowerment Zones from the more than 268 communities that applied.
       The 2000 Budget proposes legislation to authorize mandatory funding for 20 new
       Empowerment Zones designated in January 1999: 15 Urban Empowerment Zones for 10
       years for a total funding commitment of $1.5 billion; $10 million for 10 years for 5 new Rural
       Empowerment Zones. The Budget also proposes authorization for $3 million grants in FY
       2000 to 15 Strategic Planning Communities also named in January 1999. In addition, the
       Administration proposes $5 million per year in mandatory funding for the 20 n·ew Rural
       Enterprise Communities designated in 1999. The budget for HUD proposes discretionary
       funding of $10 million to assist non-designated urban communities in planning and
       implementing portions of their strategic plans; and technical assistance funding of $15
       million to assist all communities in the implementation of their strategic plans.

       Indian Housing. The budget provides $620 million in block grants for Indian housing, which will
       serve 552 tribes.

Protecting Sovereignty and Promoting Self-Determination.

       Tribal Contracting and Self-Governance. BIA and illS will continue to promote Tribal
       self-determination through local decision-making. Tribal contracting and self-governance compact
       agreements now represent half of BIA' s operations budget, and over forty percent of illS' budget.
       The self-governance agreements, which give Tribes ·greater flexibility to administer Federal
       programs on reservations.

       Indian Trust Fund Balances. The Administration is committed to resolving disputed Indian trust
       fund account balances through informal dispute resolution and supports the unique
       govemrnent-to-govemrnent relationship that exists in Indian trust land management issues. After
       Tribal consultations, BIA submitted its "Recommendations of the Secretary ofthe Interior for
       Settlement of Disputed Tribal Accounts" to Congress in November 1997. Legislation reflecting
       these recommendations was proposed in 1998, but not enacted. It will be reproposed in the 106th
       Congress.

       Trust Land Management. As part ofBIA's commitment to resolving trust land management
       issues, BIA introduced legislation in 1998 to establish an Indian Land Consolidation Pilot program
       to address the fractionation of Indian land. In FY99, BIA will devote $5 million to three pilot
       projects in Wisconsin, in cooperation with Tribes, to purchase small ownership interests in highly
       fractionated tracts of land from willing sellers. The FY2000 budget proposes to double funding
       for this program.

       Trust Management Improvement Project. The Administration supports DOl's Office of
       Special Trustee's trust management improvement project. Current activities include verifying

                                                                       Hex-Dwnp Conversion
        individual Indian's account data and converting these data to a commercial-grade accounting
        system. Ownership, lease, and royalty information related to the underlying trust assets will also
        be verified and converted to a recently acquired commercial asset management system.
