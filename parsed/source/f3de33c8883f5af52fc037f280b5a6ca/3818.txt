RE:            RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOPWOODIPROPOSITION 209

DATE:          AUGUST 5, 1997

SUMMARY

         The Administration is investigating options to ensure diversity in higher education in
light of some of the effects of the Hopwood decision and the University of California Board of
Regents' decision to exclude race as a factor in admissions. Two approaches to the problem are
being pursued simultaneously: (1) litigation to reverse the decision and/or law and (2) policy
initiatives to improve diversity in higher education. This memo is not concerned with the
litigation strategy, but rather with some possible policy initiatives that could be implemented
both long-term and short-term.

       This memo first lists some of the actions already being taken in California and Texas to
combat the Board of Regents' decision and the Hopwood case. These actions are excerpted
from a memorandum from Leslie Thornton at the Department of Education dated July 18, 1997.
We also plan to set up a meeting with Leslie Thornton, DOE, and DOJ this week.

        Following the section on actions being taken in California and Texas, this memo outlines
a universal set of possible proposals to investigate further, grouped in the following categories:
(1) pre-kindergarten; (2) kindergarten through eighth grade; (3) high school; and (4) access
opportunities, regardless of age.

       Following the outline of policy proposals, this memo lists some possible participants in a
planning meeting and proposes a tentative time line for planning and implementation.

I.     ACTIONS BEING TAKEN IN CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS

       A.     CALIFORNIA

             Forming "school-centered partnerships" among each UC campus and public
              schools chosen for their poor academic performance, to establish standards and to
              improve student achievement.

             Expanding academic outreach programs for K-12 students.



                                                1
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion


    Creating an "infonnation outreach" program to help students and their families
     prepare for college.

    Alternative admissions strategies. A June 24, 1997 article in the Sacramento
     Bee set out how each ofUC's nine campuses will "experiment" with different
     admissions policies in an effort to achieve diversity. UC-Davis: in filling 40% of
     the places in its 1998 freshman class, UC-Davis will give weight to factors other
     than grades and test scores such as extracurricular leadership experience;
     attendance at a high school that is economically disadvantaged and has a
     historically low level ofUC attendance; residence in the three counties closest to
     the university; military service; and marked academic improvement in the 11 th
     grade. The new policy is only triggered, however, by students who meet UC
     minimum eligibility requirements of a combined 1000 on the SAT and a high
     school grade-point average of2.82 in designated college preparatory courses.
     UCLA: will give an advantage to applicants from disadvantaged urban and rural
     neighborhoods. UC Irvine: will look at an applicant's entire profile, not just
     grades and scores, including personal essays and extracurricular activities. UC
     San Diego: will look at "special circumstances and personal challenges" which
     could include whether an applicant is trying to become the first in his or her
     family to attend college.

    A July 9, 1997 Education Daily article says that the UC Task Force's $60 million
     dollar plan to increase minority enrollment at UC would make training and
     retaining teachers in disadvantaged schools a priority. The Task Force estimates
     the total cost of professional development at $18.5 million annually or about
     $370,00 at each of 450 schools --the disadvantaged high schools, plus 400
     "feeder" elementary and middle schools. On July 17, 1997, a Board of Regents
     committee approved the plan to double UC's annual spending on outreach
     efforts--which seek to increase minority enrollment without using affinnative
     action--from $60 million to $120 million. The $60-million additional cost
     projection for the program includes $27.2 million for school outreach efforts,
     $17.9 million for expanding academic programs that target black and Latino
     students but are open to all, and $7.9 million for contacting students, families and
     schools about UC admissions requirements.

B.   TEXAS

    The Texas legislature passed a bill that automatically admits the top 10% of all
     Texas high schools students to the state's university system.

           Ethnic Recruitment Program in which Texas residents may apply for
            grants up to $1,000. Applicants must have a 2.75 GPA and 900 SATs. The
            awards may be used at any school in which their minority group

                                       2
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

                      constitutes less than 40% of total enrollment. [The Big Book of Minority
                      Opportunities]


II.   POSSIBLE FUTURE ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN ACROSS THE
      COUNTRY

C.   HIGH SCHOOL

     Initiatives in California

           The University of California system has created a partnership with the 50
            low-performing high schools that will help students achieve better test scores and
            grades in order to help qualify for university admissions on academic merit.

           SCORE is a program at Buena Park High School, CA, which was established in
            1991. Students take field trips to variousuniversity campuses, attend classes, have
            lunch and get an overview of the programs offered. College students visit the high
            school and discuss their experiences. [Orange County Register, 1123/97]

           Advancement via Determination is a program in which 47 schools in the Colton
            Unified School District participate. This program focuses on stu~y skills and
            goal-setting with minority and low-income students.

           Cal Grants:
            Grant A:        from $600 to $4,500 to help low-income residents of the state
                            cover tuition and fees at colleges-- renewable for up to 3 years.
            Grant B:        from $600 to $1,200 as a living allowance to low-income students.

                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

            used at any school in which their minority group constitutes less than 40% of total
            enrollment. [The Big Book of Minority Opportunities]

     Other Initiatives

           Courses to help prepare for the college admissions tests like the SAT.

           Expand grants to pay for Advanced Placement (AP) testing (this was in our
            budget proposal).

           Urban systemic refonn which builds on the Department of Education's 1996
            proposed urban initiative (ACE) which focused on accountability, choice and
            excellence through an urban grants program.

           Teacher Recruitment and Preparation initiative proposed under Title V of HEA.

           Community Schools Program in Department of Education's FY 1998 budget.

     .     After School Programs in proposed amendment to Juvenile Justice bill.

           School Construction (action needed depends upon outcome of budget
            reconciliation).

           Upward Bound is a federally funded program for low-income high school students
            which was started in 1965 under the Higher Education Act. Through the program,
            students attend summer courses and after-school or Saturday classes throughout
            the year either at their school site or at a college. Some Upward Bound programs
            also give the students financial assistance for college preparatory activities such as
            paying for the SAT processing fee.


           Aid with processing of fonns associated with going to college -- Some for-profit
            companies target minorities with programs that will identifY scholarships
            available to them, assist them in their completion of fonns and even college
            entrance essays.

D.   ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES


    Insert a proposal in the higher education reauthorization bill that would create a one-stop
     shopping approach to make future students aware of all the possible financial aid that is
     available.

                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


   Aggressively promote, in California, Texas-like legislation on admissions to upper-tier
    universities for students graduating in the top percentage of their class.

   Issue of early Pell grant proposal (Rep. Chaka Fattah).

   Bully pulpit and Department of Education activity to promote HOPE scholarship and
    federal student financial aid, especially with students and parents in CA and TX.

   Creation of an interactive Website that would provide a customized list of financial aid
    available.

   Using existing resources and programs (Title I, Safe and Drug Free Schools, Technology
    Literacy Challenge, e-rate, Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Vocational Education) to more
    effectively support the improvement of urban education, by:

          greater targeting of resources to urban areas through appropriations requests,
           formula changes, or regulatory changes;
          increased flexibility in the use of formula funds to support local improvement
           strategies;
          better information on effective practices for addressing urban issues with federal
           program funds;
          targeted technical assistance to help small number of districts use program funds
           and R&D to strengthen reforms, with a special emphasis on reading and math
           standards;
          accessing resources in EZ'sIEC's to support education improvement; and
          targeting funds for National Board for Professional Teaching Standards to provide
           support to urban and rural teachers preparing for board certification and/or
           incentives for board-certified teachers to teach in high poverty urban and rural
           schools.

   Programs to improve the scores of minorities on the SAT

          Organizations, businesses, schools and colleges across the country are sponsoring
           SAT study groups for disadvantaged students. For example, in Atlanta, the local
           chapter of an African-American fraternity, the NAACP, and the school board run
           a course that costs $75 instead of the $700 fee of a commercial course. Prince
           George's County schools work with Maryland's Bowie State University. The
           program offers an intensive, 14-week SAT-preparation course for 150 high school
           students, with the goal of increasing college-entrance rates. The university and
           private businesses are paying for the program; the school system is picking up the
           tab for transportation.

          Kaplan works with volunteer organizations to train SAT tutors. It also goes into

                                            6
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
            high schools with needy students to offer services for free or at a reduced charge
            to the youths. Financial aid for disadvantaged students is also available.

           The Princeton Review Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the Princeton Review,
            runs reduced-cost programs in conjunction with local foundations for about 1,500
            students nationwide and has distributed books and trained tutors in local groups.

           Stanford Testing Systems makes SAT-test preparation materials available at a
            relatively low cost. Some of their test-prep programs are free on the Internet.

           The University of California at Riverside recently started a two-week program to
            raise the SAT scores of black high school students. Students receive individual
            tutoring, two hours of computer work each day, and an hour of group instruction
            each day.

    Hispanic Education Initiative (NEC is leading the effort on this).

   Racially Identifiable Schools (busing, integration)

   Tribal Schools with reforms to come.

   Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)

   Outreach to minority students generally.

   Fixing failing schools.

   Support on-going research on alternative admissions policies for gaining a diverse student
    body.

     Retention at college: Several colleges run programs designed to increase the retention of
