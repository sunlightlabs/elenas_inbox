Here's a crack at the 2 Q's and A's you requested. The DC voucher
guidance begins with previouslyt approved material (except for bracketed
language on veto), plus what Mike originally submitted on Cleveland study
(I don't have the final on that).   I don't think you have seen the test
talking points before; they were developed for the Hill.==================== ATTACHM

                            Press Guidance on DC Vouchers
                                   September 22, 1997


Q:   While integration was the Civil rights issue of the 50's and 60's, some African
     Americans (such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter) see vouchers as the civil
     rights issue of the 90's. What is the administration's position on vouchers in DC?

    The Administration strongly opposes any legislation allowing the use of Federal taxpayer
     funds for vouchers, including in D.C.

    We need to focus on strengthening the public schools that serve the vast majority of
     students and expanding choice within the public education system, such as through
     charter schools that only stay open as long as they do a good job.

    Vouchers would siphon critical dollars from neighborhood public schools that are already
     short on resources in order to send a few selected students to private schools, and would
     distract attention from the hard work of reform needed to change failing schools into
     good schools and good schools into outstanding schools.


Q:   Doesn't the failure of the DC schools to manage so basic a task as to open the
     schools on time call into question the capaCity of the school system here to improve?
      Shouldn't vouchers be allowed here at least?

A:   The delay in opening the DC schools has been very unfortunate. However, vouchers
     would do nothing to speed the process of repairing DC schools, and would accomplish
     nothing for the vast majority of students who will continue to attend these schools. In
     fact, vouchers would divert attention and resources away from the public schools and the
     hard task of reforming them. We need to confront the real problems that the DC school
     system has -- by raising standards, putting into place effective reform strategies, and
     holding students, teachers and schools accountable for their performance. Establishing
     vouchers in DC would set a dangerous precedent for using taxpayer funds to support
     schools that are unaccountable to the public, [and that's why the President's senior
     advisors would recommend that he veto the DC appropriations bill if such a provision
     were included].
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
Q.   The New York Times recently reported a very favorable evaluation of the
     Cleveland school voucher program_ Has this study caused you to reassess your
     views?

A.   No, for several reasons.

     First, the New York Times article is misleading. The "evaluation" findings it reports are
     not from the official, independent state evaluation being conducted by Indiana University,
     and whose first report is not scheduled to be released for several weeks.

     Second, this study actually focuses on students in only 2 of the 41 schools participating in
     the Cleveland voucher program -- only 15% of the students involved in the voucher
     program. These two schools are resource-intensive, run by avowed pro-voucher
     advocates, and are not typical of the other private schools participating in the program.

     Further, the study relies on questionable analysis techniques. For example, it uses
     questionable testing procedures and fails to take into acount the background or prior
     achievement of the voucher students.

     Third, our opposition to vouchers is based as much on what happens to students who do
     not participate as on what may happen to the few who do. The fact is that 90% of our
     students attend public schools, and our primary responsibility, especially with limited
     federal resources, is to make sure that the public schools they attend are among the best in
     the world. This means concentrating our time and money on raising academic standards,
     improving teaching, providing schools with technology and other up-to-date leaming
     tools, and creating charter schools and other forms of choice within the public school
     system. It means holding schools accountable for the results they achieve -- something
     fundamentally impossible to do with private schools which are, by design, unaccountable
     to the public. Instead, vouchers drain financial resources and energy away from our most
     important task -- improving our public schools.

                        Minority Opposition to the National Tests

Q:   Many in the civil rights community have been critical of the President's national testing
     proposal, and nearly the entire black and Hispanic caucuses voted against the plan in the
     House. What is the Administration's response to the charge that these tests will do more
     harm than good for children of color?

A:

    The Voluntary National Tests would make it clear that all children, wherever they live,
     whatever their color, and whatever their language background, can and should achieve to
     the same high standards as students throughout the nation. Any delay in these tests
     sends a terrible signal that we doubt whether our kids can achieve.

    Over the long run, the national tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math will most
     benefit the kids in poor urban and rural areas who currently need the most help. For
     the first time ever, parents, teachers and the public in these communities will know how
     well students perform compared to national and even international standards in reading
     and math, making it harder to shortchange any student when it comes to learning.

    Educators and parents can use results of the tests to provide valuable help to low
     performing students, while communities can use the results to hold administrators and
     teachers accountable.

    Moreover, the national tests can become a rallying point for local efforts to strengthen
     curriculum, provide training to teachers, increase parental and community involvement,
     and support the necessary investments at the local, state, and national levels to improve
     our schools.

    One year after instituting higher standards and tough tests, the School District of
     Philadelphia has demonstrated that raising standards, measuring performance, and
     working to improve results truly works. On September 3, Philadelphia released results
     of its 1997 testing program, recording significant gains in reading, math and science at the
     4th, 8th and 11th grades. This was accomplished despite a very large increase in the
     number of students taking the test, over 40 of whom were either special education
     students or students for whom English is not their first language -- students who many
     wrongly assume cannot learn to high standards.
