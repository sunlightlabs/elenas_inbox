MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 DONNA SHALALA
                      BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:              WELFARE--TEXAS INTEGRATED ENROLLMENT PROJECT

        As you know, Texas has asked for federal permission to issue a "request for offers" for a
private company to operate an integrated enrollment system for Medicaid, Food Stamps, and
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Labor unions, particularly the public employees
unions, strongly oppose any private sector role in the eligibility determination process.

         We believe we must give Texas an answer immediately. The state has engaged in good
faith discussions with various agencies for 9 months, and state officials are now publicly
criticizing the Administration for the delay.

        We believe we have a proposal which will break the stalemate, one which strikes a
reasonable balance between allowing the state to explore innovative ways to deliver public
services and ensuring beneficiaries' rights to assistance. As shown in the chart below, our plan
would allow Texas to have private contractors obtain information and documentation needed to
determine eligibility and assist an individual in completing an application for benefits.
However, the final determination or "certification" of eligibility would be conducted by public
sector employees.

                                           Texas            Union        Our Proposal
 Allows Private Contractors to:           Proposal         Proposal

      Assist Individuals in                 Yes               No              Yes
      Completing Applications

      Determine or Certify                  Yes               No              No
 Eligibility

      Consider Appeals                      No               No               No

      Conduct Quality Control               No               No               No




                                                 1
                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
Our plan would:

              Protect beneficiaries by ensuring only merit system employees, who are not
               subject to monetary or political pressures, determine benefit eligibility, consider
               appeals, and conduct quality control operations.
              Allow Texas to achieve program efficiencies through a bidding process. The
               Texas legislature, in authorizing the project in 1995, required any savings to be
               used to fund additional health and human services programs. The state estimates
               the savings will provide health care coverage for an additional 150,000 needy
               children.               .
              Apply to the Food Stamp program a definition of public and private
               responsibilities used successfully in Medicaid.
              Use waiver authority, which deems the project an experiment, allows for public
               comment, and enables us to limit the experiment to Texas or a handful of states.

        We would allow the state of Texas to release a request for offers based on these
principles. Once the state chooses among the bids, the state would be required to submit to us
the proposed contract for approval.

Background on Texas Proposal

        The new welfare law explicitly allows states to contract with private entities to administer
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Because of this new authority in T ANF,
some states are' seeking new contracting authority for Medicaid and Food Stamps as well, so they
can operate privately-run, one-stop eligibility centers. In addition to the Texas proposal
discussed below, Wisconsin has submitted a proposal which would allow 10% of its welfare
offices to be operated by private entities.

         Federal agencies and the state of Texas have been negotiating since June 1996 over the
state's proposal to privatize the administration of TANF, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and certain
other federally-funded nutrition programs. The state legislature passed the plan with bipartisan
support, with endorsements from Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and other leading Democrats. Under
the Texas plan, private contractors would collect information about applicants (including by
conducting interviews) and make eligibility determinations. The State would retain control over
the appeals and quality control processes. An estimated 15,000 state jobs would be eliminated
or transferred to the private sector. The state would require bidders to comment on whether
they plan to hire displaced government workers. Such companies as Lockheed, EDS, and
Arthur Anderson have indicated an interest in bidding.

       Texas has argued that it cannot proceed with plans to contract out TANF (as allowed by
the welfare law) unless the Administration allows private contracting for Food Stamps and
Medicaid, because maintaining separate eligibility systems for these programs creates
administrative difficulties. To take the most obvious problem, a dual system would require
many individuals to go to one location to apply for TANF and another location to apply for
Food Stamps and Medicaid. Texas wants a one-stop eligibility center.

                                                 2.
                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


        Texas state officials are becoming increasingly impatient with HHS and USDA for not
having ruled on their proposal. In a recent letter to HHS, state officials threatened to proceed
with the project without Federal approval. State officials also point out that they have pledged
to reinvest the savings from their plan in additional health and human services programs, and that
these savings could provide health coverage for 150,000 Texas children. Rep. Charlie
Stenholm, one of the Administration's strongest welfare reform allies, complained about the delay
to Frank Raines in a February 24th letter, saying the state of Texas is ''willing to make
accommodations to address administration concerns." Secretary Shalala has promised Texas an
answer by early April. Most recently, we heard from Rep. Stenholm's office and from Gary
Mauro that Texas would accept modifications of its proposal as long as we allow the State to go
forward with releasing a "request for offers" ("RFO") to potential bidders.

          Labor leaders would like us to refuse the Texas request entirely. They see even limited
privatization as a dangerous precedent and have made clear that they view this decision as
critically important to public employee unions.

Recommendation

        All the relevant agencies and White House offices agree that the Administration should
draw the line on the basis of our existing Medicaid policy, which allows privatization of some
but not all administrative functions. Under this approach, the application, interview, and other
information-gathering can be done by private employees; the eligibility determination itself, as
well as appeals and quality control, must remain in the hands of public employees. In addition,
the Administration should ensure that contracts protect against the possibility that private firms
will use procedures that lead to inappropriate denials -- or, as OMB notes, inappropriate grants --
of program benefits.

        This general approach has both strong precedent and good sense behind it. The
Medicaid program already allows private hospital workers to do intake and eligibility work, up to
the point of actually determining eligibility. Allowing privatization of these functions,
conditioned on appropriate contract incentives and safeguards, strikes the right balance between
allowing states to explore innovative ways to deliver public services and ensuring that
beneficiaries' rights are protected. There is little doubt that this approach will displace some
state workers and displease public employee unions. But we have crossed this bridge already in
Medicaid and other contexts; for example, the Department of Labor has granted a waiver to
Massachusetts to contract out all employment services and is prepared to do the same for other
states as well.

        In line with this view, we recommend that we inform Texas of the principles we will
apply in reviewing any privatization scheme and give formal permission to the State to issue its
RFO. Once the State accepts a bid, we will review whether the contract appropriately accords
with our principles. This approach gives Texas a lot less than it asked for, but allows the State
to proceed with some reforms. It preserves a role for public employees, but will still anger the
unIOns.
