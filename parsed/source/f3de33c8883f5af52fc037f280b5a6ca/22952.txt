MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  DPC Weekly Report

        Health Care -- Medicare Commission prescription drug benefit update. Senator
Breaux is now indicating that he would like to find a way to integrate a prescription
drug benefit into his Commission's recommendations. Beyond believing that drug
coverage is important to the program, he knows that including a viable benefit is critical
to having any chance of enticing Laura Tyson and Stuart Altman to support his plan.
Laura and Stuart have explicitly rejected Senator Breaux's option because they do not
believe it assures access to affordable prescription drugs for all beneficiaries. More
specifically, because the Senator is limiting his option to low-income beneficiaries and
those in private health plans, it is clear that millions of beneficiaries -- particularly in
rural areas -- might be left without access to any affordable drug benefit. This is
because many rural areas will not attract private health plans to offer coverage. This
helps explain why Laura and Stuart are so adamant that the traditional Medicare
fee-for-service plan offer a drug coverage option as well. (They also believe that to
ensure fair competition this benefit should be available in both traditional Medicare
program and private insurers.) In response to Senator Breaux's request for assistance,
Laura and Stuart are trying to design the parameters of a prescription drug benefit. It
is likely to be a mid-range priced plan, in which the benefit is optional, has a 50 percent
rather than a 75 percent subsidy, and a $250 or $500 deductible with a $1,500 or $2,000
cap on the value of the overall benefit. (This is a much more modest package than a lot
of the advocates were hoping for, but it is probably much more realistic from a financial
and political perspective.)
        Health Care -- Prescription drug comments are raising concerns: You should be
aware that your comments on Thursday about prescription drug benefits were construed by
many as opening the door to a partial drug benefit that is strongly opposed by all your base
Democrats and even Laura Tyson and Stuart Altman. We have responded that, consistent
with the views of Laura and Stuart, an appropriately structured and modestly subsidized
benefit (which assures the drug benefit would be affordable) would eliminate the need to
make the coverage mandatory. As such, an optional drug benefit would allow those few
Americans fortunate enough to have retiree health benefits to not be forced to purchase a
Medicare drug benefit they do not need. One last point; opponents of a drug benefit (or those
who wish to limit it) point to the fact that 65 percent of beneficiaries have a drug benefit
already, so that a drug benefit would substitute public dollars for private dollars, and waste a
                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                   2

large amount of money. Ironically, a break out of this number illustrates why limiting the
drug benefit to certain populations just does not work. Of the 65 percent of beneficiaries
with some type of coverage, 20 percent already have Medicare or Medicaid coverage (so there
would be no substitution of Federal dollars), another 28 percent have employer-based retiree
health coverage, which is declining in unprecedented degrees and is tax subsidized, and 10
percent have Medigap coverage, which is underwritten, expensive and. declining. The
remaining 7 percent are transitioning in and out of Medicare and Medicaid mostly. As a
result, a decent drug benefit that is accessible to all beneficiaries would not substitute many
Federal for private dollars, would be a far more substantive and affordable benefit, and -- as
Laura Tyson says -- would be far more efficient from an economic perspective. Without a
doubt, however, this issue is extremely complicated; we are carefully contemplating options
and will be forwarding you additional information shortly.

        Crime -- Assault Weapons: The Justice Department is preparing to release a report
from the National Institute of Justice on the impact of the 1994 assault weapons ban. The
report's findings are encouraging about the effectiveness of the ban, but are limited due to the
relatively short study period (24 months post-enactment), with some analyses conducted with
only one year of postban data. Among the key findings were:

       (1) Decline in criminal use of the banned guns. Law enforcement requests for ATF
       traces on assault weapons used in crimes decreased by 20 percent in the first year after
       the ban took effect, as compared to a 11 percent decrease for all guns.

       (2) Ban likely contributed to reduction in gun murder rate. Even controlling for other
       factors (e.g., pre-existing state assault weapons bans, juvenile handgun bans,
       California's three-strikes laws, New York's quality of life policing), the study
       estimates that gun murder rates were between 6.7 to 10 percent lower the year after the
       ban's enactment.

       (3) Reduction in assault weapons used to kill police. Murders of police by offenders
       armed with assault weapons declined from an estimated 16 percent of gun murders of
       police in 1994 to early 1995, to 0 percent (none) in the latter half of 1995 and early
       1996. However, such incidents are extremely rare to begin with, and researchers
       could not conclude the ban's impact on the general reduction in gun murders of police.

       (4) Significant but temporary market effects. The ban triggered speculative, sharp
       price increases and additional production of the banned firearms prior to the law's
       implementation. The increases were followed by a substantial drop in prices once the
       law took effect returning prices to pre-ban levels. The report suggests that the market
       effects made the banned weapons less accessible to criminals.

       (5) No impact on reducing average number of victims per gun murder incident, or
       multiple gunshot wound victims.

        Crime -- Diallo Shooting: This week, you inquired about the recent shooting in New
York City. On February 4; 1999, Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, was shot in
front of his apartment building in New York City by four white officers of the New York City
Police Department. A total of 41 shots were fired, and Mr. Diallo died at the scene. The
officers did not find a weapon on or near Mr. Diallo. The four officers were part of a
specialized street crime unit reportedly searching for a rapist. Working with the White House
Counsel we have learned the following: (1) the FBI has opened an investigation into the
shooting and is assisting with forensic analysis; (2) DOJ's Civil Rights and Criminal
Divisions, and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York have been working
closely with the Bronx District Attorney's Office on the investigation; and (3) the Community
Relations Service has conducted conciliation services in Harlem, including attending the
recent memorial service and demonstration on February 12. Additionally, for almost two
years, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York·- with the cooperation
of the New York Police Department -- has undertaken a review into whether the department
has engaged in a pattern or practice of police misconduct.

        Education -- NAEP Reading Scores: On Thursday, the National Center for
Education Statistics will release state-by-state reading scores from the 1998 National
Assessment of Educational Progress "Reading Report Card." Earlier this month, Vice
President Gore and Secretary Riley announced the national scores from this report, which
showed that for the first time in nearly 30 years of testing, there were small but statistically
significant gains in average reading scores in the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades between 1998 and
1994: 4th and 12th grade scores returned to 1992 levels after a drop between 1992 and 1994,
but the new 8th grade scores were up even from 1992. The state-by-state data is still being
compiled, but the Education Department expects that most states will show improvements
over the past four years. Secretary Riley will hold a press conference in Washington D.C.,
and Vice President Gore will highlight New York and Connecticut scores in an event in New
York City.

        Education -- "Read Across America" Day: On Tuesday, the NEA is holding its
annual "Read Across America" day, celebrating Dr. Seuss' birthday and focusing the nation's
attention on the importance of reading.

        Education -- Release of National Title I Assessment: On Monday, the Department
of Education is scheduled to release the National Assessment of Title I , which is a
Congressionally mandated report examining the impact of the 1994 amendments to the
program -- namely, the progress being made toward the goal of having all children served
under Title I meet high academic standards. The National Assessment examines the progress
of students served by the program and the implementation of key Title I provisions at the
state, district and school level. The National Assessment will report on progress in
improving achievement for students enrolled in high-poverty schools, in increasing the
number of Title I schools using standards-based reform and in accelerating state and local
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion                                   4

efforts to assist Title I schools. Revisions to the Title I program that were made as part of the
1994 ESEA reauthorization -- such as allowing schools to use their Title I funds for
schoolwide improvements and pool their funding from all sources -- have made it more
challenging for the National Assessment to track the use of Title I funds and blurred the
distinction between program participants and other children. At this time, we are still
working with the Education department to clarify what are the actual conclusions of this very
important report; according to the Department of Education, the results are somewhat mixed.
         Education -- Bipartisan discussions about a centrist education agenda: Senator
Lieberman and Senator Gorton are working with a number of centrist outside groups and
individuals to develop principles for a bipartisan approach to reauthorizing ESEA. They are
hoping to secure support for these principles from about 5 Democrat and 5 Republican
Senators, as well as some leading education experts from outside the Administration and
Congress. The principles are likely to include a focus on accountability, teacher quality,
public school choice, and some consolidation of existing federal education programs. These
principles are very much under development, but at this point would apparently not include
school construction, block grants, or private school vouchers.

        Welfare .-- Reporting on Working Families in Poverty: On Thursday, the research
group Child Trends put out a report on working poor families. The report, based on 1996
Census data, found that children of working parents were much less likely to be poor. Only 9
percent of children whose parents work were poor, compared to 63 percent with parents who
didn't work. Thus, children in non-working families were seven times more likely to be poor
as children in working families. The study defined working as at least 20 hours per week for
a single parent family and 35 hours for a two parent family (the same as required by the
welfare law).

        The report also found that working does not guarantee an escape from poverty, at least
by the official poverty definition. The study found 35 percent of poor children have working
parents. However, the report used the official measure of poverty, which does not include as
income the Earned Income Tax Credit or non-cash supports such as Food Stamps. Many
analysts have calculated how EITC and Food Stamps help provide families with resources to
move above the poverty line. As the Council of Economic Advisers has reported, the EITC
lifted 4.3 million people out of poverty in 1997 and over half the decline in child poverty
between 1993 and 1997 can be explained by changes in taxes most importantly in the EITe.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has calculated that a family of four can reach the
$17,100 poverty line through a full time minimum wage job ($9,800), the EITC ($3,700), and
Food Stamps ($3,600).

        Immigrant Benefits -- Declining Participation: The Urban Institute will issue a
report on Monday showing evidence of a "chilling effect" that has resulted in fewer immigrant
families, compared to citizen families, accessing an array of public benefits. The study found
welfare use by noncitizens declined by 35 percent from 1994 to 1997 while use by citizens
declined 15 percent. While Medicaid use by citizen households under 200 percent of poverty

     did not change significantly, non-citizen family participation dropped 19 percent. Since most
     legal immigrants were still eligible for benefits in 1997, these effects may be the result of the
     publicity surrounding the debate over welfare and immigration reform leading people to think
     they were ineligible or that accepting benefits would affect their immigration status. As you
     know we have been working closely with the Department of Justice and HHS on these issues,
     and we expect the INS will issue guidance in the near future to provide clarity on what type of
     benefits an immigrant can accept without being labeled a "public charge." Clearer guidance
     on public charge policies, along with our proposals to restore additional health, nutrition, and
     disability benefits to vulnerable legal immigrants, will allow us to begin sending clearer
     messages to immigrant families regarding their eligibility for benefits.

             Economic Development -- Yankee Stadium: We have contacted Representative
     Rangel's staff regarding the Congressman's interest in preserving Yankee Stadium and keeping
     the Yankees in the Bronx for the forseeable future. It appears that the Congressman is
     looking for support to identify existing and new funds to improve transportation access (both
     highway and rail links), and to promote commercial development in the area surrounding the
     stadium. His staff in9icated they are not looking to utilize federal funds to help rehabilitate
     the stadium. Along with the NEC, OMB, and other relevant agencies, we will be discussing
     whether there is an appropriate role for federal involvement and if so, what are some of the
     possible tools and resources we can make available for the project.

            Children and Families -- Child Care.            The House Ways and Means
     Subcommittee on Human Resources will hold a hearing on child care on March 16,
     which is significant because the last Congress refused to hold even a single hearing on
     the issue. The Administration will lead off the hearing testimony. Also, the
     Subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Ben Cardin (D-MD), plans to introduce a child
     care bill largely based on the Administration's proposals prior to the hearing.
