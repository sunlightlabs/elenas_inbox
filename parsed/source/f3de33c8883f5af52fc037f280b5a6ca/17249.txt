    TEXT:
    Per our discussion this afternoon on Race Initaitive next steps, Judy
    mentioned that the Initiative Staff will distribute a draft one-page
    workplan in each of the different areas to serve as starting points for
    discussion. Attached is a draft workplan for the policy working group
    with some ideas on goals, process, products, and resources.   Please take a
    look and give me any comments so that I can incorporate your ideas before
    our Wed. lPM meeting.   Thanks.  ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ================

       - take stock of existing achievements (talk about them often) and brainstorm new ideas.
       Also focus concurrently on health and administration of justice issues.
      Cabinet agencies to come up with list of policy proposals (updated monthly) for WH and
       PIR discussion and coordination - identify tough questions and re-examine existing issues
       or beef up enforcement of current law - goal is to identify three issues by end of this
       month for concrete next steps
      DPC and PIR to develop comprehensive list of policy options in education and economic
       opportunity areas
      Identify specific actions possible for each policy option:
              administrative                        regulatory
              legislative                           budget
              Executive Order                       enforcement
      Identify and coordinate opportunities for regular and targeted policy events - bi-weekly or
       monthly - develop policy message consistent with communications strategy
      Identify special problem areas in education and economic opportunities needing further
       analysis and study right away - announce research efforts for longer term issues

Products:
     Policy and budget announcements - list of three ideas for this month
     Legislative proposals
     New regulations
     Executive orders - i.e. draft E.O. creating Interagency Forum on Race Statistics and
      Indicators
