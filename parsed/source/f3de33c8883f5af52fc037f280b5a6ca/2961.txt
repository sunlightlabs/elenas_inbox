                         Stamps, and WIC




This "Demonstration" Could Cover 58% of Medicaid Beneficiaries.
The Fi~ance Committee proposal is a big change to undertake without
Congressional hearings or oversight.   The proposal would allow up
to 10 states to turn all their health and human services programs
-- including Medicaid, child welfare, Food Stamps, and WIC -- over
to private contractors. These private contractors would decide
which families were eligible for benefits - - a new and untested role
for private agencies.

If the 10 states with the largest Medicaid caseloads
(CA, FL, GA, IL, MI, NY, NC, OH, PA, TX) exercised this option, then
58 percent of the nation's Medicaid beneficiaries would be in the
private system (see attached).    Texas alone, whose application is
deemed approved by this provision, has 7 percent of the nation's
Medicaid caseload.

This Proposal Should be Out of Order Because it Affects Programs
Outside Finance Committee Jurisdiction. This proposal explicitly
allows private contractors to operate eligibility and enrollment
determination functions for Food Stamps and the Special Supplemental
Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).     In its
reconciliation markup last week, the Senate Agriculture Committee
did not include a provision to allow private contractors to operate
WIC or Food Stamps.   Thus, the Finance Committee is violating
jurisdictional rules by including this provision here.

Under the TANF Block Grant, States Can Already "Privatize" Welfare
-- Are We Ready to Let them Privatize Other Programs Too? The new
TANF welfare block grant gives states tremendous flexibiity.  States
set eligibility rules, and they can hire private or religious
organizations to screen applicants, provide benefits, and operate
welfare to work and abstinence programs.     TANF will provide an
opportunity to test privatization -- we don't need any more
"demonstrations" right now.

    There is a Role for the Private Sector in Medicaid -- but Not in
    Determining Eligibility for Federally Guaranteed Benefits.
    Medicaid and other programs already take advantage of private sector
    efficiencies by hiring private sector providers, such as managed
    care companies, for-profit hospitals, and computer systems experts.
     This role is entirely appropriate and allows the Medicaid program
    to take advantage of the competition of the private market.      This
    proposal, on the other hand, would allow private companies to perform
    what has always been a public function - - determining who's eligible
    for taxpayer-funded benefits. Making decisions about the
    eligibility of needy people for benefits is one of the most
    fundamental functions of government.

    Private Incentives Could Undermine Efforts to Balance the Budget.
    The goal of this legislation is to eliminate the federal deficit
    by the year 2002.  There's reason to be concerned that private
    contractors determining eligibility for open-ended federal
    entitlements may cost the federal government more -- either through
    higher error rates during start-up or becausE!alcompany's primary
    concern would be its own bottom line, not the federal treasury's.


    Privatization May Not Be in the Best Interest of Beneficiaries. To
    prevent cost-overruns or simply to reduce spending, states may
    include financial incentives in company contracts which would
    encourage them to cut corners with complicated cases and make them
    more likely to deny benefits.  It is unclear how much of a federal
    role there would be in monitoring contracts and ensuring basic
    safeguards.

    It's Unclear What Kind of Texas Program is "Deemed Approved" by this
    Provision.   The State of Texas has not submitted an actual proposal
    to privatize state functions, nor requested a waiver of any federal
    statutes or regulations.    Instead, the state sought guidance from
    HHS and the Department of Agriculture about the terms under which
    it could release a "request for offers" (RFO) seeking private bids.
     Although select state and federal agency officials have seen the
    State's proposed "RFO", its terms have not been made public.   Thus,
    Senators may approve a plan that not one of them has seen.

    The Committee May Regret a Decision which Encourages States to
    "Appeal" Agency Waiver Decisions to Congress. By deeming the Texas
    application approved as submitted, the Finance Committee will
    encourage other states unhappy with agency waiver decisions to
    appeal, flooding the Committee with petitioners.

     On May 13, 1997, in a letter to Texas Health and Human Services
Commissioner Michael McKinney, HHS and the Department of Agriculture
responded in writing to certain questions that had arisen in
discussions with Texas state officials.

     The State of Texas had not submitted an actual proposal to
privatize State functions, nor requested a waiver of any federal
statutes or regulations.  Rather, the state and federal agencies
had engaged in discussions to provide guidance to the state in its
plan to release a "request for offers" to seek private vendors.

     The Administration's letter concluded that the state could
develop an integrated enrollment system so long as public employees
perform the essential eligibility determination functions.    For
example:

         A non-public employee may not take actions involving
          discretion or value judgments, including all elements of
          the benefit eligibility determination process that relate
          to the evaluation of information provided by an applicant
          or which bears on the eligibility decision.

         In an integrated enrollment system, most if not all
          activities involving personal contact with an applicant
          or recipient have the potential to involve the use of
          discretion or judgment and must be performed by state merit
          system employees.

     But much flexibility is currently available to the state, the
letter said:

         The state has broad authority to administer the Temporary
          Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, the block
          grant created by last year's welfare law, and can use
          private contractors without limitation there.

         The state can also use private contractors to design and
          operate information systems, develop and recommend revised
          eligibili ty processes, and provide training and assistance
          in the management of an integrated enrollment system.
