MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT:       Refonns that Prepare Medicare for the Retirement of the Baby Boom Generation


        The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) that you enacted took critically necessary steps to
modernize the Medicare program and prepare it for the twenty-first century. It extended the life
of the Trust Fund to 2010, invested in preventive benefits, provided more choice of plans for
beneficiaries, strengthened our ongoing fraud activities, and lowered cost growth to slightly
below the private sector rate through provider payment refonns and modest beneficiary payment
increases. However, the BBA's policies were not intended to solve the long-term problems
posed by the retirement of the baby boom generation.

       The Medicare Commission was established to address the demographic challenges facing
the program. However, a major policy and political question remains. Is there anything we can
and should do prior to the March 1999 Commission deadline that could further strengthen the
program and lay the groundwork for implementation oflikely Commission recommendations?

         The National Economic Council (NEC) and Domestic Policy Council (DPC) have led an
interagency examination of several targeted policy options. This memo examines options for
coverage for pre-65 year olds, Medicare coverage of patient care costs associated with clinical
trials, and a project to increase awareness of private long-term care insurance. Financing
options to pay for these proposals follow this description.

        Your advisors have differing views on whether to pursue any new proposals while the
Medicare Commission is active and which proposals to pursue if you choose to do so. OMB
and to some extent Treasury have concems about a pre-65 option, because it may open the door
to subsidies for a costly population and have the unintended effect of reducing employer
coverage. Both OMB and Treasury oppose the clinical cancer trials proposal because it could
set a precedent for every other disease group asking for the same treatment. In addition,
altogether, it may well be the case, that the traditional Medicare savings alone will not be
sufficient to offset the costs of these proposals. As such, a decision to propose a pre-65 policy
may be feasible only if the decision is made to propose an income-related premium or, much less
likely, dollars from any residual tobacco tax. It is worth noting that an income-related premium
would clearly be more politically acceptable to our Democratic base if it were linked to a benefit
expanSIOn.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
A.     PRE-65 HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS

        Although people between 55 and 65 years old are generally more likely to have health
insurance, they often face greater problems gaining access to affordable health insurance,
especially when they are sick. Individuals in this age group are at greater risk of having health
problems, with twice the probability of experiencing heart disease, strokes, and cancer as people
ages 45 to 54. Yet their access to affordable employer coverage is often lower because of work
and family transitions. Work transition increase as people approach 65, with many retiring,
shifting to part-time work or self-employment, as a bridge to retirement. Some of this transition
is involuntary. Nearly half of people 55 to 65 years old who lose their jobs due to firms
downsizing or closing do not get re-employed. At the same time, family transitions reduce
access to employer-based health insurance, as individuals are widowed or divorced, or as their
spouses become eligible for Medicare and retire.                   .

        As a result, the pre-65 year olds, more than any other age group, rely upon the individual
health insurance market. Without the advantages of having their costs averaged with younger
people (as in employer-based insurance), these people often face relatively high premiums and,
because of the practice of medical underwriting, may be unable to get coverage at any price if
they have pre-existing medical conditions. While the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation improved
access for people with pre-existing conditions, it did not restrict costs.

        These access problems will increase because of to two trends: the decline in retiree health
coverage and the aging of the baby boom generation. Recently, firms have cut back on offering
pre-65 retirees health coverage; in 1984, 67 percent oflarge and mid-sized firms offered retiree
insurance but in 1997, only 37 percent did (although this decline may be slowing). In addition,
in several small but notable cases (!<.Z., General Motors and Pabst Brewery), retirees' health
benefits were dropped unilaterally, despite the firm's prior commitment to their retirees. These
''broken promise" retirees do not have access to COBRA continuation coverage and could have
difficulty finding affordable individual insurance. An even more important trend is
demographic. The number of people 55 to 65 years old will increase from 22 to 30 million by
2005 and to 35 million by 2010, over a 50 percent increase. Assuming current rates of
uninsurance, this trend could raise the number of uninsured in this age group from 3 million
today to 4 million by 2005, without even taking into account the decline in retiree health
coverage.

       The last reason for considering the coverage issues of this age group is the likelihood of
proposals to raise Medicare eligibility age to 67, consistent with Social Security. The
experience with covering a pre-65 age group now will teach us valuable lessons if we need to
develop policy options for the 65 to 67 year olds.

        Policy Questions. Two central questions guide policy decisions in this area: what is the
target population, and what is the best way to cover these people.




                                                2
                                                                        Hex-Dutnp Conversion

        Whom to Target_ As with any incremental refonn, targeting is essential to reduce the
chance that the policy does not unintentionally offset or reduce employer health coverage..
While this policy will not affect employers' decisions to offer coverage to their current workers,
it may affect employers' decisions to cover retirees, as well as employees' decisions to retire
early. At the same time, the current level of employer dropping suggests that a policy for the
affected people is needed. Although your advisors remain divided on the advisability of
implementing a new policy in this area, we all agree that any policy protect against substitution
by limitmg eligibility to a subset of the pre-65 year olds. There are two design approaches to
achieve this.

       The first approach is to limit eligibility by age. We recommend an age break of 62,
which is already the most common retirement age. The 6 million people ages 62 to 65,
compared to people ages 55 to 59, work less (48 percent versus 74 percent), are more likely to
have fair to poor health (26 versus 20 percent), and are more likely to be uninsured or buy
individual insurance (28 versus 21 percent). In addition, it is alsothe age at which Social
Security benefits can be accessed. Within this 6 million, we could limit eligibility to the 2
million without access to employer or public insurance, and would require that they exhaust
COBRA coverage before becoming eligible. These steps should reduce the likelihood that the
policy will lead individuals to retire or drop retiree coverage.

        A second approach is to limit eligibility within a broader age group -~, 55 to 65 year
olds - to individuals who lack access to employer-based insurance for particular reasons:
(1) Displaced workers: About 60,000 people ages 55 to 65 lost their employer insurance when
they became lost their job because a finn closed, downsized, or their position was eliminated.
(2) Medicare spouses: As many as 420,000 people lost employer-based family coverage when
their spouses (almost all husbands) turned 65 and retired. This number could grow if employers
drop retirees' dependent coverage for these spouses as a result of this policy. (3) "Broken
promise" people: A small but visible and vulnerable group is the pre-65 retirees who lost retiree
health coverage due to a "broken promise" (ie., when the employer unexpectedly terminates
coverage).

        How to Provide Coverage. The second question is: what is the best way to increase
access to affordable insurance? One approach is to extend COBRA continuation coverage for
longer than 18 months. Currently, COBRA allows workers with insurance in firms with 20 or
more employees to continue that coverage for 18 months by paying 102 percent of the premium.
The major problems with extending COBRA are that (1) people in small firms are not eligible,
(2) businesses will consider the policy an unfunded mandate, and (3) the policy could lead to
discrimination against hiring older workers. In addition, firms could use this longer COBRA
mandate as an excuse to not cover any employees. Despite these difficulties, a COBRA
extension appears to be the best option for the "broken promise" people, since the former
employer would bear some of the costs of its decision to terminate coverage and COBRA could
then serve as a "bridge to Medicare" for this population.




                                                3
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
        A second option, preferable for most of the target groups, is a Medicare "buy-in."
Eligible people could buy into Medicare at the age-adjusted Medicare payment rate, plus an
add-on for the extra risk of participants. Because the actuaries think that most participants will
be sicker than average, this add-on will be costly. To attract healthier people and make it
possible for more people to take advantage of the benefit, we could defer payment of the
additional cost until age 65 by "amortizing" this payment. Under this scheme, Medicare would
pay part of the premium as a loan up front, with repayment by the beneficiaries with their Part B
premiums after they turn 65. The HCFA actuaries have estimated that this Medicare "loan" in a
worse-case scenario would cost $1.1 billion per year assuming participation of no more than
300,000 people. Because the preliminary estimates assumed that only sick people would
participate and that all would enroll in one year, and because they did not take into account the
pay-back from beneficiaries, the official estimates, expected soon, will probably be lower.
Subsidies would be considerably more costly and your advisors agree that we cannot afford it.

        Option 1. "Broken Promise" People Only. All your advisors recommend a policy
that employers who break their promise of providing retiree coverage extend COBRA so that
retirees can buy into their active employer plan at a higher premium as has been done for other
special COBRA populations until age 65. This option has no cost to the Federal governm~nt.

         Option 2. Medicare Buy-In for Select Groups. The second option is to allow a
limited group of 55 to 65 year olds to buy into Medicare. If you decide to consider any of the
Medicare buy-in proposals, OMB favors undertaking only the "Medicare spouses" - primarily
uninsured women ages 55 to 65 whose husbands are already on Medicare. OMB argues that, if
the goal is a limited test of a buy-in for the pre-65 year olds, this is a discrete group whose
eligibility would likely have a smaller effect on the general trend in retiree health coverage or
retirement. The Department of Labor strongly supports a policy to help displaced workers, in
line with the broader theme of improving workers' security. In the absence of a buy-in, Labor
would support a COBRA extension, though this approach would help fewer people. HHS
supports covering these select groups, but is concerned that the enrollment be sufficient to justify
the administrative effort. The small size of these groups means that costs will be low.

        Option 3. Medicare Buy-In for 62 to 65 Years Old Plus Selected Groups. The third
option is to permit eligibility for 62 to 65 year olds plus a group like displaced workers. The
cost of this option is not yet known but will likely be less than $5 billion over 5 years. HHS and
NECIDPC think that this is a sufficiently narrow group to limit significantly the effects on retiree
health coverage or retirement. This group is also more representative of the 65 to 67 year old
population, giving a better sense of what would happen if Medicare eligibility were postponed to
67 years old. Although Treasury is concerned that this policy could become an underfinanced
policy expansion, some concerns would be allayed if the buy-in participants were enrolled only
in managed care, so that the insurers and not Medicare bore the risk. This approach, however,
could be politically difficult given the distrust of managed care. OMB thinks that the 62 to 65
group is not narrow enough and that the "unsubsidized entitlement" (the subsidy is in the
financing) will not stay that way for long. It is important to note that we are still waiting for
actuarial analyses, which could alter the reconunendations of your advisors.
B.      PRIVATE LONG-TERM CARE OPTIONS

                                                 4
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

         A second idea to improve access to insurance focuses on long-term care. Unlike acute
care, long-temi care is not primarily financed by private insurance, which pays only 6 percent of
its costs. Medicaid pays for 38 percent, Medicare pays for 21 percent, and families pay for 28 of
the costs out of pocket. This large government role may not be sustainable as the baby boom
generation retires. Today, one in four people over age 85 lives in a nursing home. This could
increase substantially as the proportion of elderly living to age 90 is projected to increase from 25
percent to 42 percent by 2050. Thus, it is important to encourage the development of private
insurance options. The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation took a step in this direction by
clarifying that certain long-term care insurance is tax deductible. But because many people
incorrectly assume Medicare covers all of their long-term care needs and do not know about
private long-term care insurance, more action is needed. This action could include providing
information to Medicare beneficiaries about private insurance, funding a demonstration program
to improve the quality and price of private insurance, or both. None of these options includes a
new Medicare entitlement or subsidy.

Information on Quality Private Long-Term Care Insurance

        We propose to leverage our role in Medicare to improve the quality of and access to
private policies. HCFA would work with insurers, state regulators, and other interested parties
to develop a set of minimum standards for private long-term care policies. If a plan met these
standards, Medicare would approve its inclusion in the new managed care information system.
(As a reminder, the BBA included provisions to provide annual information on managed care
choices to beneficiaries.) This proposal would build upon that system and cost up to $25 million
in discretionary funds over 5 years ($5 million in FY 1999), distinct from the user fees currently
authorized for the managed care information system. We also could propose a demonstration
that would test the feasibility of a partnership between Medicare and private long-term care
insurance on a limited basis. The cost of a demonstration would depend on its size and policy
parameters, but could be limited to $100 to 300 million over 5 years.

Discussion

        We believe this proposal has significant potential and is worth further developing. There
is some concern at HHS that coming to an agreement on a set of standards could be difficult and
that insurers may argue that our standards drive up the cost of the policies, making them
unaffordable. HHS also would prefer that any demonstration be funded through the mandatory
budget. However, these concerns may not be insurmountable, especially since one objective of
a demonstration could be to investigate high quality private options that are affordable. Finally,
we are still looking into the feasibility and advisability of using tax incentives to encourage the
purchase of private long-term care policies and/or the use of IRAs for long-term care financing ..

c.     MEDICARE COVERAGE OF CANCER CLINICAL TRIALSH~l\-Dump Conversion

        Medicare has not traditionally covered patient care costs associated with clinical
trials. Scientists and advocates believe that we are not making sufficient progress in
treating cancer, in part because the lack of Medicare coverage limits participation in these
trials. HHS and DPC have been working on an approach that covers patient care for a
limited number of these trials. Because of concerns about its cost, OMB and Treasury
strongly oppose this option.

       Nearly half of all cancer patients are covered by Medicare, yet Medicare does not
cover patient care costs associated with these trials. This care can often be prohibitively
expensive for cancer patients and their families, perhaps explaining why only 3 percent of
all cancer patients participate in trials. Expanding Medicare coverage could increase
access to trials for the many beneficiaries with cancer. Historically most insurers have
covered clinical trials for children. As a consequence, nearly 70 percent of children with
cancer participate in clinical trials. Scientists agree that this participation rate has helped
improve cancer treatments for children, and some argue that it is one reason for the
dramatically higher survival rates for children cancer patients.

         This problem has significant implications for research in all cancer areas,
particularly for those cancers like prostate cancer where scientists still have no good
answers and where clinical. trials are particularly undersubscribed. According to a former
National Cancer Institute director, if 10 percent of all cancer patients participated in such
trials, trials that currently take three to five years would take only one year. Additionally,
as the nation's largest insurer, Medicare plays a significant role in setting the standard for
the insurance companies. A commitment from Medicare to cover clinical trials would go a
long way to encourage private insurance companies to cover these trials.

Proposal

       We have developed a proposal to expand Medicare to cover cancer clinical trials
conducted at the NCI and trials with comparable peer review. In addition, we would
require a National Cancer Policy Board to make further coverage recommendations, and
HHS to assess the incremental costs of such trials compared to conventional
Medicare-covered therapies. Assuming the true incremental costs are substantially less
than the actuaries project, as we believe, additional trial coverage as recommended by the·
Board could occur. The initial coverage would cost $1.7 billion over five years. Senators
Mack and Rockefeller have developed a more expansive and expensive proposal
(co-sponsored by 26 Senators), which covers all FDA trials, many of which the experts
believe do not meet a scientifically-meritorious standard. However, we do believe that
there may be some middle ground between our proposal and the Senators' proposal that
could be justifiable on policy grounds but more costly.

        A possible alternative way to cover clinical cancer trials' patient care costs is to
dedicate resources from any significant increases that NIH I NCI receive in the upcoming
budget. NCI could use these increases to simplify and centralize their clinical trials
system, which has the potential to increase patient access. Although this option may be
viable, the cancer community has clearly stated its preference for extending Medicare
coverage. Another possibility is to require drug companies desiring Medicare coverage of
additional clinical trials to contribute to the part of the patient costs.

 Discussion

         HHS is supportive of this policy and believes that it would not only give Medicare
  beneficiaries, who represent a significant portion of cancer patients, much-needed choices
  but would encourage the private industry to cover clinical trials as well. There is no
  question that this proposal is the highest priority for most of the cancer community as well
  as many in the women's community who believe it is an essential step to improve breast
  cancer treatment. However, the advocates have made it clear that they would strongly
. prefer the more expansive and expensive RockefellerlMack approach. Conversations with
  the Senators suggest that they would support this proposal as an important rust step; this
  support will weigh heavily with patient groups and the cancer community.

         OMB and Treasury oppose the Medicare coverage option strongly. They note that
 it would involve very substantial costs ($1 to 3 billion per year) to provide medical services
 that are experimental, and ther.efore are unlikely to help the majority of beneficiaries.
 Once an exception has been made for experimental cancer drugs and therapies, they argue
 there is no reason that similar support won't be demanded for experimentation with
 Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other maladies. As a result, these costs will grow as other
 therapies are included. They also believe that Congress would likely expand the proposal
 beyond coverage ofNCI trials and that this expanded coverage will be very costly (up to $3
 billion over five years). OMB also believes that rather than Medicare leading the way on
 clinical trials, drug companies should be the first to contribute to improving access for
 Medicare beneficiaries.

         While recognizing the OMB and Treasury concerns, the DPCINEC believes that this
 policy has potential to contribute to important expansions of clinical trials and possible
 break-throughs in cancer treatment. We believe that we should investigate the possibility of
 amending the current policy to tap into the drug industry as a financing partner. In addition, we
 believe that this policy will be even more attractive if we are unable to rmd the resources to
 double the NIH budget. Although we support the cancer clinical trial policy, if we have
 limited resources available in Medicare and it comes down to a choice between the pre-65
 initiative and this one, we would recommend the former.

D.     PAYING FOR INITIATIVES: MEDICARE ANTI-FRAUD AND
       AN INCOME-RELATED PREMIUM

        We assume that the funding for these Medicare initiatives will require Medicare offsets.
One approach is to use Medicare anti-fraud initiatives. HHS and OMB believe that these offsets
could total about $2 billion over 5 years. This could fund some, but not all of the initiatives
described above. To fund a more expansive series of initiatives, you will probably have to
consider an income-related premium. As you know, Medicare subsidizes 75 percent of the Part
B premium for all beneficiaries, including the wealthiest. This policy is not only regressive; it
ignores the fact that higher income beneficiaries actually cost Medicare more than poor
beneficiaries. But the addition of an income-related premium would constitute a move away
from the concept of social insurance.

Anti-Fraud Provisions

        In our ongoing efforts to reduce Medicare fraud, we have identified a number of small but
important policies that could sum to about $2 billion over five years. Several of them address
problems identified by the HHS Inspector General, such as the overpayment by Medicare for
certain cancer drugs, highlighted in recent press reports.

Income-Related Premium

       As you know, the Administration has publicly supported an income related premium.
However, it is not clear whether we should carry through on this support by including it in the
budget. The Medicare Commission will definitely consider and probably recommend this
policy. Yet, there remains some Democratic opposition to this policy and some of your advisors
would counsel not to move unilaterally in this direction. Because this issue is extremely
controversial, this description is not intended to present recommendations but to begin a
discussion of the topic.

        Building from our position last summer, the income-related premium would be
administered by the Treasury Department, not HCFA or the Social Security Administration.
Eligible people would fill out each year a Medicare Premium Adjustment form (a separate form
or a line on the 1040 form) and send a check to ''The Medicare Trust Fund." The two open
questions are: who pay and how much do they pay. The answers to these questions determine
costs, but the more modest proposals generate about $8 billion over five years.

       Who pays. The income thresholds determine how many people are paying the higher
amount. We proposed thresholds of $90,000 for singles and $115,000 for couples in the Health
Security Act. Last summer, the Senate, including most centrist Democrats, passed a policy
where the extra premium payment began at $50,000 for singles and $65,000 for, couples. During
the budget debate, we did not state publicly our support for any particular thresholds.

                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
                  How much. The amount of the payment for the wealthiest beneficiaries is a second
          question. In the budget debate, we argued that a 100 percent premium (no subsidy) would cause
         ,some healthy and wealthy people to opt out of Medicare. However, an analysis by the Treasury
          Department this fall found that the effects of a 100 percent premium would be small. (About
          5% of beneficiaries who pay the full premium would drop.) HHS would strongly object to
          changing our position and supporting an income-related premium that completely phases out the
          Part B subsidy. If we decide to change our past policy, it might be advisable to have a strategic
          discussion about the timing of announcing such a change. It could be an important in
          negotiating the give and take on this issue.

         Discussion

                  The decision to include an income-related premium is a complicated one. On one hand,
         it is almost certain that this policy will be recommended by the Medicare Commission. At that
         point, however, we will have less opportunity to direct any of its revenue toward important
         Medicare reforms like a Medicare buy-in. On the other hand, many Democrats and possibly
         AARP will oppose the income-related premium as a beneficiary payment jncrease. A possible
         exception is if it is explicitly linked to a Medicare investment or possibly a pre-65 policy. In
         addition, Republicans might label it a new tax and use our support for it as an issue during the
         1998 campaign.

                  Although our discussions are ongoing, the agencies believe that the decision to propose
         an income-related premium depends on the context. OMB's position ultimately depends upon
         the entire package of initiatives and savings being offered. OMB considers the income-related
         premium to be a sound policy option, but believes that it should be considered as a means to
         offset Medicare Trust Fund insolvency or provide benefit expansions for the currently eligible
         Medicare population. HHS believes that if an income-related premium is pursued, its savings
         should be used for Medicare. HHS further notes that Medicare has already contributed $115
         billion in savings and that we may wish to preserve this option for the Commission
         recommendations lest we have the Commission with no reasonable options. DPCINEC will
         prepare for a separate meeting to discuss this issue.
