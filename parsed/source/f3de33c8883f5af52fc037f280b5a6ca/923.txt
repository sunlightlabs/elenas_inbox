                    ENDING BUSINESS AS USUAL IN WASHINGTON
                             A Strong Record of Reform


      "The fact is, organized interests have too much power in the halls of government. These
influence groups too often promote their own interest at the expense of the public interest. Too
often they operate in secret. Too often they have special privileges ordinary Americans don't
even know exist.... We have an historic opportunity to renew our democracy and strengthen our
country. Ifwe truly believe in a government that puts ordinary Americans ahead of the
powerful and privileged, then we must act and act now. "

                                  President Bill Clinton
                                  February 17, 1996

A Record of Accomplishment:

        Time and again, President Clinton has exhibited his commitment to curbing the influence
of special interests and money in our political system. Since entering office President Clinton
has pursued a far-reaching agenda of political reform. The President is committed to reforming
the way Washington works and ending business as usual. Among his accomplishments, he has:

      Made voting easier for more than 11 million Americans by creating more accessible
       voter registration locations by enacting the National Voter Registration Act
       ("Motor-Voter"). The Motor-Voter law has already created the greatest expansion in
       the voter registration rolls since the 19th century.

      Fought for and signed into law the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The Act is the first
       overhaul of lobbying rules in 50 years and requires lobbyists to disclose who they work
       for and eliminates loopholes that allow lobbying organizations to avoid

      Gift ban. In the 1995 State-of-the-Union Address, President Clinton challenged the
       Congress to ban gifts, meals, travel and entertainment from lobbyists. The Congress
       subsequently passed the ban on November 16th, 1995.

      Enacted the Congressional Accountability Act to ensure that the same laws apply to
       Congress as to the rest of America.

      Closing the "lobbyist loophole." In 1993, President Clinton proposed, and Congress
       passed, legislation ending the tax-deductibility of lobbying expenses, which had allowed
       corporations and others to deduct the cost of their lobbying.

      Imposed the strictest Administration ethics guidelines ever, including a five-year ban
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


       on top officials lobbying their former agencies and a lifetime ban against lobbying for
       foreign governments.

      Enacted line-item veto legislation which significantly enhances the presidential authority
       to eliminate wasteful spending by allowing the President to cancel wasteful special
       interest projects and targeted tax breaks that benefit special interests. The line-item veto
       can help the President close the door on business as usual in Washington by ending
       breaks for special interests and cutting pet spending projects that sneak into the budget
       year after year. With this line-item veto, the President will have a valuable new tool to
       ensure that our public resources are being put to the best possible uses.

      Enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to restrict Congress from passing on new
       mandates to state and local governments without paying for them.

      Special Interests. President Clinton has stood up to special interests, such as the
       National Riffle Association and the tobacco industry, loosening their tight hold on our
       legislative process. The President broke six years of congressional gridlock and defeated
       the gun lobby by enacting a ban on assault weapons and the Brady Law.

      Enacted the Presidential Executive Office Accountability Act (PEOAA) which ensures
       that the Executive Office of the President lives under the same laws as the rest of the
       country -- this is the White House analog to the Congressional Accountability Act.

A History Of Fighting For Real Campaign Finance Reform

1992          Campaign Finance Reform Proposal. In the 1992 campaign, Governor Clinton
              proposed spending limits, free TV time, PAC limits and a ban on soft money.
              The current McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan legislation mirrors this
              proposal.

1993-1994     Campaign Finance Reform Plan. The. President and the congressional
              Democratic leadership proposed a reform plan that also included partial public
              funding for congressional candidates. Reform groups praised the President for
              his support of the plan. Unfortunately, the legislation was filibustered, despite
              passage in both chambers.

1995          Bipartisan CFR Commission. In June of 1995, the President agreed with
              Speaker Gingrich to create a bipartisan political reform commission. The
              President named John Gardner and Doris Keams Goodwin to launch the
              commission, but they were rebuffed by the Speaker.

1996 - 1997   McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan.           In the 1996 State-of-the-Union, the
              President announced his support of the bipartisan bill. He repeated his support
              throughout 1996. In the 1997 State of the Union Address the President
              challenged Congress to pass this legislation by July 4th, 1997. On January 11,
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


1997 the President met with the bipartisan co-sponsors of the House legislation
(Shays-Meehan), reiterating his belief that delay will mean the death of reform.
