                              June 5,1998

 To ensure that all Americans have an opportunity to succeed in the Information Age,
President Clinton believes that we must make universal technology literacy for our children a
national goaL Technology literacy will allow students to use the latest Information Age tools
for learning, research, and communication -- and compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs the
US. economy is creating in record numbers.

President Clinton is also committed to increasing investment in research and development to
create economic growth and maintain America's leadership in science and technology. His
FY99 budget includes record increases for the National Science Foundation and the National
Institutes ofHealth. In his FY2000 budget, the President will call for significant increases in
the information and communications R&D within agency budget allocations.


               IN TODAY'S SPEECH, PRESIDENT CLINTON WILL:
             Challenge States to Make Technology Literacy a Requirement for Middle
             School Graduation;
             Pledge to Provide $180 Million over Three Years to Train a Team of Teacher
             Technology Experts in Each Middle School -- Who Could in Turn Help Train
             Other Teachers;
             Urge Telecommunications Companies and the Congress to Support the
             "E-Rate" -- Which Will Provide up to 90 Percent Discounts to Our Poorest
             Schools to Connect Them to the Internet;
             Announce the Administrations's Support for $15 Million in Competitions to
             Encourage the Development of High-Quality Educational Software and
             Educational Web Sites by Students, University Faculty, and Commercial
             Software Companies; and
             Pledge to Increase Long-Term Computing and Communications Research in
             his FY2000 budget


A NEW EFFORT TO EXPAND TECHNOLOGY LITERACY

(1)     Technology Literacy as a Requirement for Middle School Graduation: President
        Clinton is challenging states to make technology literacy a requirement for middle school
        graduation. Just as good schools would not allow students to graduate from middle
        school without being able to read and write -- all students should be technologically
        literate pefore they graduate from middle school. This is a "new basic" -- but it clearly
      . rests on a foundation of the fundamentals. Obviously, knowing how to send e-mail or
        browse the Web will not help a child that can't read and write effectively.

(2)    Technology Training for Teachers: To reach the goal of universal technology literacy,
       President Clinton is pledging to provide $180 million over three years to train a team of
       teacher technology experts in each middle school -- who could in tum help train other
       teachers. The money would go to states that agree to establish technology literacy as a
       requirement for middle school graduation.


                                                1
         Congress to support the "e-rate" -- which will provide up to 90 percent discounts to our
         poorest schools to connect them to the Internet.

 (4)    Competition for High-Quality Educational Software: The Administration will support
        $15 million in competitions over the next three years to encourage the development of
        high-quality educational software and educational Web sites by students, university
        faculty, and commercial software companies -- and make it easier for teachers and parents
        to find high-quality educational resources.

 THE NEED TO ACT - ENDING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

 Although there is some evidence that we are beginning to close the gap between information
 "haves" and "have-nots" -- America must act if we are to avoid a digital divide.

       In 1997, high-minority enrollment schools were almost three times less likely to have
        Internet access in classrooms than predominantly white schools (13 percent of classrooms
        vs. 37 percent). [Source: Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, March
        1998.]

       Similarly, poor schools were more than 2 'it, times less likely to have Internet access in
        classrooms than wealthy schools (14 percent of classrooms vs. 36 percent). [Source:
        Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, March 1998.]

       While 73 percent of white students (high school and college) own a home computer--
        only 33 percent of black students do. [Source: "Bridging the Digital Divide: The Impact of Race on
        Computer Access and Internet Use," Thomas P. Novak and Donna L. Hoffman, Vanderbilt University,
        February 2, 1998]

       While 77 percent of wealthy households own a cornputer at home, only 19 percent of
        poor households own one. [Source: Forrester Research, December 1997.]

PRESIDENT CLINTON'S RECORD - MAKING ALL OF OUR CHILDREN
TECHNOLOGICALLY LITERATE

. Beginning in 1995, President Clinton established four goals (the "four pillars") to ensure that all
  of our children are technologically literate -- (1) connecting every classroom to the Internet by the
  year 2000; (2) expanding access to multimedia computers; (3) ensuring that teachers are as
  comfortable with a computer as they are with a chalkboard; (4) and promoting the development
  of high-quality educational software. He has:

       Proposed a 5 year, $2 billion Technology Literacy Challenge Fund -- with $475 million in
        FY99 -- to help states and local communities meet these four goals;

       Proposed $75 million in investments in FY99 to ensure that all new teachers can use
        technology effectively in the classroom;

       Signed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 - which provides deep discounts to connect
        schools and libraries to the Internet that need it most;

In his FY99 budget, President Clinton has called for the largest increase in history at the National~
Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health -- and increases in many other areas of
civilian research and development. This budget proposal would allow increased investment to
help find a cure for cancer, reduce greenhouse gases with more energy-efficient technologies,
explore space, and develop the Next Generation Internet.

In his FY2000 budget, President Clinton will call for significant increases in the long-term
information and communications R&D within agency budget allocations. The National Science
and Technology Council-- in consultation with the President's Information Technology
Advisory Council -- will be responsible for developing a long-term research agenda. Some of
the exciting research challenges that lie ahead include:

       Developing supercomputers that are hundreds oftimes faster than today's machines, and
        that will allow scientists and engineers to more accurately predict the impact of climate
        change and design more fuel-efficient engines;

       Making computers so easy to use that all Americans can use them, including the 55
        million Americans with disabilities;

       Increasing our ability to design complicated information systems that are reliable; and

       Developing high-speed wireless networks that can help bring distance learning,
        telemedicine, and economic opportunity to every rural community in America.
