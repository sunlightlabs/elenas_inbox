  Smaller Classes and Modern Schools




        A State-by-State Analysis


                  February 20, 1999
                      Investing in Smaller Classes and Modern Schools
                          **Embargoed for Release February 20, 1999 (10:06 a.m.)**


In his weekly radio address, President Clinton is urging Congress to pass his education agenda which includes
reducing class size in the early grades to a national average of 18, building and modernizing up to 6,000 schools
nationwide, and strengthening accountability.


Reduced Class Size in the Early Grades
Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide more personal attention to students and spend less time
on discipline; as a result students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. In 1998,
President Clinton proposed to help local schools hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers in order to reduce class
size in grades 1-3 to a national average of 18, and make sure that every child gets a solid foundation in the
basics. Last year, the President signed into law the first installment of his seven year, $12.4 billion proposal to
hire 100,000 new teachers. For the first year, $1.2 billion was provided to help local communities hire 30,000
teachers. Now Congress must provide the next installment of$l.4 billion to fund a total of38,000 teachers:


New Classrooms and .Modern Schools
One third of all schools are in need of extensive repair, according to the General Accounting Office. School
districts also face the cost of upgrading schools to accommodate new technology and growing enrollments. To
meet these urgent needs, President Clinton in his balanced budget proposes Federal tax credits in lieu of
interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds to build and modernize up to 6,000 public schools. Two types of bonds
are being proposed: (1) $22 billion in School Modernization Bonds to help states and local districts build and
modernize public schools with half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to the 100 school districts serving the
largest number of low-income children and the other half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to states. An
additional $400 million of bonds would available for schools on Indian reservations; and (2) $2.4 billion in
Qualified Zone Academy Bonds to finance renovation and new school construction in Empowerment Zones and
high poverty areas through innovative partnerships between public schools and businesses.

Ensuring Accountability
In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced a package of accountability measures designed
to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to ensure that school districts and states provide
sUldents with a high quality education. While insisting that states and local governments retain primary
responsibility for education, President Clinton called on Congress to make sure federal dollars support what
works. His proposal emphasizes reforms that a growing number of states, cities, and schools across the nation
are implementing and that are producing clear results. Specifically, the President announced that he will send
to Congress legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that schools end
social promotion; teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned; states and districts turn around
their lowest-performing schools; parents get annual report cards on school performance; and schools institute
effective discipline policies.

to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to ensure that school districts and states provide
students with a high quality education. While insisting that states and local governments retain primary
responsibility for education, President Clinton called on Congress to make sure federal dollars support what
works. His proposal emphasizes reforms that a growing number of states, cities, and schools across the nation
are implementing and that are producing clear results. Specifically, the President announced that he will send
to Congress legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that schools end
social promotion; teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned; states and districts turn around
their lowest-performing schools; parents get annual report cards on school performance; and schools institute
effective discipline policies.

In his weekly radio address, President Clinton is urging Congress to pass his education agenda which includes
reducing class size in the early grades to a national average of 18, building and modernizing up to 6,000 schools
nationwide, and strengthening accountability.

Reduced Class Size in the Early Grades
Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide more personal attention to students and spend less time
on discipline; as a result students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. In 1998,
President Clinton proposed to help local schools hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers in order to reduce class
size in grades 1-3 to a national average of 18, and make sure that every child gets a solid foundation in the
basics. Last year, the President signed into law the first installment of his seven year, $12.4 billion proposal to
hire 100,000 new teachers. For the first year, $1.2 billion was provided to help local communities hire 30,000
teachers. Now Congress must provide the next installment of $1.4 billion to fund a total of 38,000 teachers:

            Under President's Clinton's proposal, Delaware would receive $7 million in fiscal year 2000
            to support a total of 178 teachers.

New Classrooms and Modern Schools
One third of all schools are in need of extensive repair, according to the General Accounting Office. School
districts also face the cost of upgrading schools to accommodate new technology and growing enrollments. To
meet these urgent needs, President Clinton in his balanced budget proposes Federal tax credits in lieu of
interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds to build and modernize up to 6,000 public schools. Two types of bonds
are being proposed: (1) $22 billion in School Modernization Bonds to help states and local districts build and
modernize public schools with half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to the 100 school districts serving the
largest number of low-income children and the other half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to states. An
additional $400 million of bonds would available for schools on Indian reservations; and (2) $2.4 billion in
Qualified Zone Academy Bonds to finance renovation and new school construction in Empowerment Zones and
high poverty areas through innovative partnerships between public schools and businesses. Under President
Clinton's proposal:


            Delaware would receive tax credits to support $47 million in school modernization.

                          **Embargoed for Release February 20,1999 (10:06 a.m.)**

In his weekly radio address, President Clinton is urging Congress to pass his education agenda which includes
reducing class size in the early grades to a national average of 18, building and modernizing up to 6,000 schools
nationwide, and strengthening accountability.

Reduced Class Size in the Early Grades
Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide more personal attention to students and spend less time
on discipline; as a result students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. In 1998,
President Clinton proposed to help local schools hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers in order to reduce class
size in grades 1-3 to a national average of 18, and make sure that every child gets a solid foundation in the
basics. Last year, the President signed into law the first installment of his seven year, $12.4 billion proposal to
hire 100,000 new teachers. For the first year, $1.2 billion was provided to help local communities hire 30,000
teachers. Now Congress must provide the next installment of $1.4 billion to fund a total of38,000 teachers:

            Under President's Clinton's proposal, Iowa would receive $11 million in fiscal year 2000 to
            support a total of 309 teachers.

New Classrooms and Modern Schools
One third of all schools are in need of extensive repair, according to the General Accounting Office. School
districts also face the cost of upgrading schools to accommodate new technology and growing enrollments. To
meet these urgent needs, President Clinton in his balanced budget proposes Federal tax credits in lieu of
interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds to build and modernize up to 6,000 public schools. Two types of bonds
are being proposed: "(1) $22 billion in School Modernization Bonds to help states and local districts build and
modernize public schools with half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to the 100 school districts serving the
largest number of low-income children and the other half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to states. An
additional $400 million of bonds would available for schools on Indian reservations; and (2) $2.4 billion in
Qualified Zone Academy Bonds to finance renovation and new school construction in Empowerment Zones and
high poverty areas through innovative partnerships between public schools and businesses. Under President
Clinton's proposal:


            Iowa would receive tax credits to support $135 million in school modernization.


Ensuring Accountability
In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced a package of accountability measures designed
to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to ensure that school districts and states provide
students with a high quality education. While insisting that states and local governments retain primary
responsibility for education, President Clinton called on Congress to make sure federal dollars support what
works. His proposal emphasizes reforms that a growing number of states, cities, and schools across the nation
are implementing and that are producing clear results. Specifically, the President announced that he will send
to Congress legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that schools end
social promotion; teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned; states and districts turn around
their lowest-performing schools; parents get annual report cards on school performance; and schools institute
effective discipline policies.

New Classrooms and Modern Schools
One third of all schools are in need of extensive repair, according to the General Accounting Office. School
districts also face the cost of upgrading schools to accommodate new technology and growing enrollments. To
meet these urgent needs, President Clinton in his balanced budget proposes Federal tax credits in lieu of
interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds to build and modernize up to 6,000 public schools. Two types of bonds
are being proposed: (I) $22 billion in School Modernization Bonds to help states and local districts build and
modernize public schools with half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to the 100 school districts serving the
largest number of low-income children and the other half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to states. An
additional $400 million of bonds would available for schools on Indian reservations; and (2) $2.4 billion in
Qualified Zone Academy Bonds to finance renovation and new school construction in Empowerment Zones and
high poverty areas through innovative partnerships between public schools and businesses. Under President
Clinton's proposal:


            Minnesota would receive tax credits to support $266 million in school modernization.


Ensuring Accountability
In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced a package of accountability measures designed
to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to ensure that school districts and states provide
students with a high quality education. While insisting that states and local governments retain primary
responsibility for education, President Clinton called on Congress to make sure federal dollars support what
works. His proposal emphasizes reforms that a growing number of states, cities, and schools across the nation
are implementing and that are producing clear results. Specifically, the President announced that he will send
to Congress legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that schools end
social promotion; teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned; states and districts turn around
their lowest-performing schools; parents get annual report cards on school performance; and schools institute
effective discipline policies.

In his weekly radio address, President Clinton is urging Congress to pass his education agenda which includes
reducing class size in the early grades to a national average of 18, building and modernizing up to 6,000 schools
nationwide, and strengthening accountability.

Reduced Class Size in the Early Grades
Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide more personal attention to students and spend less time
on discipline; as a result students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. In 1998,
President Clinton proposed to help local schools hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers in order to reduce class
size in grades 1-3 to a national average of 18, and make sure that every child gets a solid foundation in the
basics. Last year, the President signed into law the first installment of his seven year, $12.4 billion proposal to
hire 100,000 new teachers. For the first year, $l.2 billion was provided to help local communities hire 30,000
teachers. Now Congress must provide the next installment of $1.4 billion to fund a total of 38,000 teachers:


            Under President's Clinton's proposal, New York would receive $127 million in fiscal year
            2000 to support a total of 3,497 teachers.

New Classrooms and Modern Schools
One third of all schools are in need of extensive repair, according to the General Accounting Office. School
districts also face the cost of upgrading schools to accommodate new technology and growing enrollments. To
meet these urgent needs, President Clinton in his balanced budget proposes Federal tax credits in lieu of
interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds to build and modernize up to 6,000 public schools. Two types of bonds
are being proposed: (1) $22 billion in School Modernization Bonds to help states and local districts build and
modernize public schools with half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to the 100 school districts serving the
largest number of low-income children and the other half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to states. An
additional $400 million of bonds would available for schools on Indian reservations; and (2) $2.4 billion in
Qualified Zone Academy Bonds to finance renovation and new school construction in Empowerment Zones and
high poverty areas through innovative partnerships between public schools and businesses. Under President
Clinton's proposal:


            New York would receive tax credits to support $2751 million in school modernization.

.New Classrooms and Modern Schools
One third of all schools are in need of extensive repair, according to the General Accounting Office. School
districts also face the cost of upgrading schools to accommodate new technology and growing enrollments. To
meet these urgent needs, President Clinton in his balanced budget proposes Federal tax credits in lieu of
interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds to build and modernize up to 6,000 public schools. Two types of bonds
are being proposed: (1) $22 billion in School Modernization Bonds to help states and local districts build and
modernize public schools with half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to the 100 school districts serving the
largest number of low-income children and the other half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to states. An
additional $400 million of bonds would available for schools on Indian reservations; and (2) $2.4 billion in
Qualified Zone Academy Bonds to finance renovation and new school construction in Empowerment Zones and
high poverty areas through innovative partnerships between public schools and businesses. Under President
Clinton's proposal:


            Rhode Island would receive tax credits to support $81 million in school modernization.


Ensuring Accountability
In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced a package of accountability measures designed
to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to ensure that school districts and states provide
students with a high quality education. While insisting that states and local governments retain primary
responsibility for education, President Clinton called on Congress to make sure federal dollars support what
works. His proposal emphasizes reforms that a growing number of states, cities, and schools across the nation
are implementing and that are producing clear results. Specifically, the President announced that he will send
to Congress legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that schools end
social promotion; teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned; states and districts turn around
their lowest-performing schools; parents get annual report cards on school performance; and schools institute
effective discipline policies.

modernize public schools with half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to the 100 school districts serving the
largest number of low-income children and the other half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to states. An
additional $400 million of bonds would available for schools on Indian reservations; and (2) $2.4 billion in
Qualified Zone Academy Bonds to finance renovation and new school construction in Empowerment Zones and
high poverty areas through innovative partnerships between public schools and businesses. Under President
Clinton's proposal:


            Washington would receive tax credits to support $285 million in school modernization.


Ensuring Accountability
In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced a package of accountability measures designed
to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to ensure that school districts and states provide
students with a high quality education. While insisting that states and local governments retain primary
responsibility for education, President Clinton called on Congress to make sure federal dollars support what
works. His proposal emphasizes reforms that a growing number of states, cities, and schools across the nation
are implementing and that are producing clear results. Specifically, the President announced that he will send
to Congress legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that schools end
social promotion; teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned; states and districts turn around
their lowest-performing schools; parents get annual report cards on school performance; and schools institute
effective discipline policies.

In his weekly radio address, President Clinton is urging Congress to pass his education agenda which includes
reducing class size in the early grades to a national average of 18, building and modernizing up to 6,000 schools
nationwide, and strengthening accountability.

Reduced Class Size in the Early Grades
Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide more personal attention to students and spend less time
on discipline; as a result students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. In 1998,
President Clinton proposed to help local schools hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers in order to reduce class
size in grades 1-3 to a national average of 18, and make sure that every child gets a solid foundation in the
basics. Last year, the President signed into law the first installment of his seven year, $12.4 billion proposal to
hire 100,000 new teachers. For the first year, $1.2 billion was provided to help local communities hire 30,000
teachers. Now Congress must provide the next installment of $1.4 billion to fund a total of 38,000 teachers:


            Under President's Clinton's proposal, West Virginia would receive $13 million in fiscal year
            2000 to support a total of 340 teachers.

New Classrooms and Modern Schools
One third of all schools are in need of extensive repair, according to the General Accounting Office. School
districts also face the cost of upgrading schools to accommodate new technology and growing enrollments. To
meet these urgent needs, President Clinton in his balanced budget proposes Federal tax credits in lieu of
interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds to build and modernize up to 6,000 public schools. Two types of bonds
are being proposed: (I) $22 billion in School Modernization Bonds to help states and local districts build and
modernize public schools with half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to the 100 school districts serving the
largest number of low-income children and the other half of the bonds ($11 billion) allocated to states. An

Qualified Zone Academy Bonds to finance renovation and new school construction in Empowerment Zones and

            West Virginia would receive tax credits to support $178 million in school modernization.
