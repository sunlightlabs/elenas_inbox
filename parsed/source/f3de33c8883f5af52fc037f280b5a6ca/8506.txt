    ACTIONS AGAINST PLANS THAT VIOLATE KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY PROTECTIONS
                                 July 7,1998

Today, on the one year anniversary of the implementation of the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation, the
President issued an Executive Memorandum directing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to
take all actions necessary, up to and including termination, against health insurers now participating in
the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) that violate the protections afforded by the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

The President also announced that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAJC) will forward any reports of violation immediately to
OPM, allowing the agency to quickly stop these abuses. These new directives underscore the
President's strong commitment to ensuring health plans abide by the HIP AA law and build on actions
the President took earlier this year.

There Have Been Reports That Some Health Insurers Are Circumventing HIP AA Protections.
Some insurers are reportedly giving insurance agents incentives to avoid enrolling qualified Americans
with pre-existing conditions, who are guaranteed access to coverage under HIP AA. Agents also have
been given incentives to delay processing applications submitted by HIPAA-eligible individuals or
small groups in order ensure that applicants have a sufficient break in coverage to lose eligibility for
HIP AA protections. Such actions are inconsistent with the letter and the spirit of the 1996 law. Today,
the President took strong action against insurers who violate the HIP AA protections. Specifically, he:

      Directed OPM to Ensure Health Plans Are In Compliance With HIPAA to Participate in
       FEHBP. In order to be eligible to participate in the FEHBP, insurance carriers subject to
       HIP AA will have to certify in writing to OPM that they are providing access to health insurance
       consistent with the HIP AA protections.

      Directed OPM to Take Action, Up To and Including Termination, of Health Plans That
       Delay or Deny Coverage to Americans Eligible Under HIPAA. To ensure compliance with
       HIP AA, the President directed the OPM to take all appropriate action -- up to and including
       termination of a participating health plans from FEHBP. This action will help ensure that the
       350 participating carriers in the FEHB program, who serve 9 million enrollees, are providing
       access to health insurance to Americans eligible under the important 1996 law.

      Directed HCFA to Report Any Abuses to OPM. The President also directed HCFA to
       report to OPM immediately any actions taken by an insurer or insurer representative that in any
       way precludes or inhibits access to the insurance protections provided under HIP AA. The
       President noted that any such referral would, of course, not in any way alter the need for or
       responsibility to utilize any and all enforcement tools at HCFA's disposal.




                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
      (NAIC) to Help Stop Abuses. The NAIC has also committed to help identify and report to
      OPM any insurers they uncover who are denying or delaying providing individuals the HIP AA
      protections.

     Requested HHS and Labor Departments report back within six months on the successes
      and shortcomings of HIPAA. This report would include specific legislative or regulatory
      recommendations that would be necessary to further strengthen this law.

These Actions Build on the President's Commitment to Assuring That HIPAA Provides Millions
of Americans Access to Health Insurance.

     Directed HHS to Issue Strong Warnings Regarding Unacceptable Insurance Practices.
      Earlier this year, when the President first learned of efforts to circumvent the HIP AA law, he
      asked the Department of Health and Human Services to take appropriate actions to stop health
      plans and their agents to cease and desist all such harmful and likely unlawful practices.
      HCF A responded by immediately releasing a strong guidance bulletin on March 18th to
      virtually every insurer in the nation. This bulletin advised insurers that delaying or denying
      health care coverage to Americans eligible for insurance under HIP AA was unlawful and
      inappropriate and underscored the Federal Government's commitment to ensure compliance.
      Since this time, there have been fewer reports of abuse. However, there continue to be reports
      that some insurers are still violating this law.

     Fought Hard for Kassebaum-Kennedy Insurance Reforms in 1996. The HIPAA law helps
      individuals keep health insurance when they change jobs, guaranteed renewability of coverage,
      and guaranteed access to health insurance for small businesses. This act includes several other
      high priority Clinton Administration health initiatives, including:

             Eliminating the discriminatory tax treatment of the self- employed. Increased the
             tax deduction from 30 percent to 80 percent for the approximately 10 million Americans
             who are self-employed. The President also signed into law a provision to phase it in to
             100 percent in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

             Strengthening efforts to combat health care fraud, waste, and abuse. The
             Kassebaum-Kennedy law created a new stable source of funding to fight fraud and
             abuse that is coordinated by the HHS Office of the Inspector General and the
             Department of Justice. In the first year alone, this effort saved Medicare $1 billion.

             Providing consumer protections and tax incentives for private long-term care
             insurance. Making long-term care more affordable by guaranteeing that employer
             sponsored long-term care insurance will receive the same tax treatment as health
             insurance and implemented new consumer protections to assure that any tax favored
             product meets basic consumer and quality standards.



                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
