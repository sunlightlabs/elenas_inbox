                               President Clinton Announces Actions
                             Responding to the Advisory Committee on
                                  Human Radiation Experiments
                                         March 28, 1997
                                            --DRAFT--

Background
       In January, 1994, President Clinton established the Advisory Committee on Human
Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to examine reports that the government had supported
unethical human radiation experiments and releases of radiation during the Cold War.  He
asked ACHRE to uncover the truth, recommend ways to right past wrongs, and suggest ways to
make sure the government will not repeat past mistakes.

        ACHRE found that the government had conducted several thousand human radiation
experiments from 1945 to 1975 and that the majority advanced biomedical research. The
Committee found, however, that some were conducted unethically. For example, scientists
injected plutonium into 18 patients without their knowledge, and researchers conducted
experiments on indigent patients and children. ACHRE made 18 recommendations to open the
public record, protect human subjects of future research, and compensate those wronged by the
government's actions.

        In October, 1995, the President received the Advisory Committee's report and made it
clear that the report would "not be left on a shelf to gather dust" He directed his Cabinet to
"use and build on these recommendations." Over the past year and a half, the Administration
has acted throughout the government to implement ACHRE's recommendations to improve
openness in government, strengthen ethics in human subjects research, and compensate
individuals for the government's mistakes.

Announcement
     The Administration released Building Public Trust, outlining its comprehensive response to the
      President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE). The report
       summarizes actions to address ACHRE's 18 recommendations.

      The Departments of Energy and Justice announced that the government has settled
       compensation claims with families of aJJ of the known individuals ACHRE recommended for
       compensation. ACHRE recommend the government compensate the families of 18
       subjects of plutonium injection experiments.      The government has settled with all 16
       families that came forward.

      President Clinton signed a memorandum to strengthen the rights and protections of people
       participating in secret, government-supported research. ACHRE recommended that
       subjects of secret experiments have special protections and information.    Acting on that
                                                                  Hex-Dwnp Conversion


        recommendation, the President directed agencies today to propose new rules for secret
        research that would require scientists to: obtain informed consent from all potential
        subjects of secret experiments; disclose the identity of the sponsoring agency to potential
        subjects; and tell potential subjects that an experiment is classified. The new rules would
        also establish a more independent review process; require the head of the agency
        conducting secret human research to approve the project; and require permanent records
        of secret experiments.      To ensure that secret human research projects are rare, the
        President also directed federal agencies to report annually on the number of classified
        human research projects and the number of subjects in each project.

      The Administration announced proposed amendments to the Radiation Exposure
        Compensation Act of 1990 to compensate hundreds of uranium miners who would not be
        compensated under current law. ACHRE found that some deserving miners do not
        qualify for compensation under the Act. The amendments would establish fairer,
        science-based criteria for compensation. The Administration will also propose regulatory
        changes to RECA to facilitate claims processing.

Previous and On-going Actions Described in Building Public Trust Indude:

Actions to Improve Openness in Government.
      ACHRE transferred more than 4,000 cubic feet of documents to the National Archives.
       The Administration has made 300,000 fully searchable pages of documents available on
       the Internet, and will add an additional 200,000 pages shortly. The Departments of
       Energy and Defense have published document search guides.
      The President signed Executive Order 12958 directing Federal agencies to review and
       declassify thousands of documents, including documents on radiation experiments.
      The CIA's Inspector General reviewed and reported on the CIA's human experiments.
       The report is on the Internet.

Actions to Protect human subjects in the future.
      President Clinton established the National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC) to
       examine bioethical issues, including human research issues. A subcommittee of NBAC
       will address certain broad questions raised by ACHRE, including how to strengthen
       Institutional Review Boards -- the local ethics panels for Federally-sponsored research.
      President Clinton directed agencies to develop plans to improve oversight of ethics rules.
       NBAC will review these plans in the coming months.
      Agencies have undertaken nationwide education efforts to raise the profile of ethical
       considerations, and are funding research to improve our understanding of informed
       consent.

Actions to Right Past Wrongs.
       In October, 1995 President Clinton apologized to all subjects on behalf of the
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

    government; former Energy Secretary O'Leary made apologies in certain individual cases.
   The Administration will propose legislation to make veterans treated with nasopharyngeal
    radiation eligible for health care services under the Veteran's Administration's Ionizing
    Radiation Program.
