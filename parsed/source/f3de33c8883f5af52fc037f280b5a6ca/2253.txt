TEXT:
If only we had known the purpose of the race initiative was to go around
the country and NOT talk about race, we could have saved ourselves a lot
of trouble. Could we get that in the charge to the commission?

Two events coming up this week offer opportunities to talk about the President's initiative on
racial reconciliation:

      Tuskegee Apology: a ceremony recognizing the survivors of the study at Tuskegee, to be
       held at the White House on Friday May 16; and

      Morgan State Commencement: a commencement address at Morgan State University in
       Baltimore, Maryland on May 18.

General

When commenting on these events you may want to make these points:

      Both events are examples of the President's commitment to the issues of racial
       reconciliation, and to moving beyond past discrimination to current and future practices.

      Note the President's personal leadership in these events. (This is an opportunity to deal
       with the commission questions -- e.g. whose on it, what is it, etc. -- make the point that
       these events and the idea of a commission appointed by the President are not the story.)

      These events are part a comprehensive Presidential Initiative in which Bill Clinton, with
       his personal history and commitment, is directly and regularly involved. It is a process
       in which he has been engaged in over the last four years (e.g. Memphis and Austin
       speeches) and throughout his life, and which will intensify in the near future as he calls
       the American people's attention to this issue.

Tuskegee Apology

      The President will issue an apology on behalf of the federal government to the survivors
       (inclliding families) of the study at Tuskegee. He will then go on to make several policy
       announcements which will address this issue, and help ensure that future scientific
       research will be more inclusive of, and sensitive to, racial minorities.

      The study at Tuskegee is a shameful episode in our nation's history, and it has left a
       legacy of distrust between the African American community and the research community.
        The right thing to do is to acknowledge and apologize for the past, and then to institute
       action steps for the future. This is a model for the kinds of action you may see
       recommended in the President's Initiative when appropriate.




                                                                          d Management S~stel"
                                                          ~utomated Re~fmSp Con'lersion
                                                                  I-\e~-\JU
    Morgan State University

            In choosing to make his first commencement address at Morgan State University, a
             historically-black school, the President is also addressing the issue of racial division, but
             indirectly in that he is not delivering a speech on race to an African-American audience.
             It will be a major address about the role of science in preparing America for the 21 st
             century.

            Thus, instead of speaking about race to a minority audience, the President will speak at
             Morgan State about an issue of national interest that transcends race; and will address the
             topic of race at the University of California at San Diego, a college and state with many
             races and ethnicities. This is an example of how he hopes in the coming year to inspire
             dialogue and conversation both about the issue of race itself, and among Americans of
             different races about the issues and values that bring us together.

            Of course, there is an obvious connection, which the President will address, between the
             role of science, the importance of having ethics that inform and guide our approach to
             science, and the study at Tuskegee.
