                the unfinished work of our time. to lift the burden of race and redeem the promise of
                America. "

                                                                                        President Bill Clinton
                                                                                               June 14, 1997

The President is leading the nation in an historic effort to build a stronger, more just and unified America -- a place
where we respect one anothers' differences and, at the same time, embrace the values that unite us. Drawing on our
diversity as a source of strength, this One America will offer opportunity and fairness to all Americans.

A NATIONAL CALL To ACTION. The President's Initiative on Race is America's initiative on race. President
Clinton is asking all Americans to take part in this important opportunity by participating in efforts that foster
constructive dialogue and positive action. At the same time, the President's plan is:

       Continuing to develop policies that ensure opportunity and fairness for all Americans. At the
        recommendation of his Race Advisory Board, the President is focusing on developing policy actions that
        will enhance educational and economic opportunity for all. Already, a number of policy actions have been
        announced, including the creation of: education empowerment zones, programs to increase quality teaching
        in undeserved areas, and tougher enforcement policies to stop discrimination in housing.

       Engaging Americans in a broad and constructive dialogue on race. The President is encouraging
        communities across the country to talk openly and constructively about race. He is asking them to use the
        opportunity not only to stand against discrimination, but also to build greater understanding across racial
        lines, to find resolutions to honest differences, and to enact solutions to identified problems.

       Highlighting Promising Practices that are working. In communities across the country, people are
        working to bridge racial divides and to create equal opportunity for all. The Race Initiative staff is
        identifying and creating a compilation of these efforts, named "promising practices," so that others may
        participate in them or replicate them in their own communities, schools, businesses and religious
        organizations.

       Recruiting Leaders. The President is reaching out to leaders in several areas of American life with a
        special emphasis on recruiting youth, education, religious and business leaders. "One America" leaders are
        those people who take up the President's call by organizing efforts in their communities or professions.
        Through their leadership, the President's Initiative on Race will reach communities throughout the nation.

       Focusing on the youth of America. The Initiative has a special focus on youth. Recognizing that young
        Americans are the future leaders of our country and that they possess a unique creativity and energy, the
        President is working to actively engage youth in all aspects of the Initiative.

       Working with the Race Advisory Board. The President appointed a small, diverse group of individuals
        who advise and assist him in outreach efforts and consultations with experts. They were chosen based on
        their outstanding leadership on this issue and their contributions to America's ongoing dialogue about race
        and reconciliation.

       Preparing a report from the President. The President will issue a report in which he will: I) present his
        vision of One America, including an assessment of the growing diversity of our nation; 2) reflect the work
        that has occurred during the Initiative; and 3) provide recommendations and solutions that enable
        individuals, communities, businesses, public and private organizations and government at all levels to

                        FIGHTING JUVENILE CRIME AND DRUG USE

'Wow, we must work together to do more, to protect our children !Tom the scourge of violent crime
and especially !Tom crimes committed by other young people. This is now my highest law
enforcement priority. We must proVIde for more prosecutors and probation officers, tougher
penalties, and also better gang prevention efforts, including affer school programs, so that young
people have something to say yes to and some way ofstaying out of trouble.
                                                                         JJ




                                                        . --President Clinton, October 9, 1997

While overall crime rates have been declining, juvenile crime and drug use remain serious
problems. Juvenile gun murders have quadrupled, teenage drug use has risen, and youth
gangs have spread to large cities and rural towns throughout America. In the State of the
Union, the President again challenged Congress to confront this issue and pass his Anti-Gang
and Youth Violence Strategy. Specifically, his strategy and budget call for:

       Targeting Gangs and Violent Juveniles. To help state and local prosecutors crackdown
       on gang members and violent juveniles, the President has proposed $100 million to hire
       new prosecutors and expand anti-gang task forces; $60 million to establish juvenile gun
       and drug courts that ensure swift and certain punishment for youthful offenders; and
       tough new penalties and prosecutorial tools.

       Cracking Down on Guns and Gun Traffickers. To keep violent juveniles from buying
       guns as adults, the President's strategy also proposes to ban violent juveniles from
       buying guns on their 21st birthdays. His strategy also increases penalties for selling
       handguns to juveniles and other offenses, and includes $28 million to expand the Youth
       Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (yCGII), which helps local law enforcement trace
       illegal firearms to their source.

       Keeping Kids In School, Off Drugs and Out of Trouble. To ensure that kids are
       supervised from 3 to 8 p.m. --the time when most violent juvenile crimes are
       committed --the President's strategy proposes $95 million for the Justice Department to
       help keep schools open later and to promote anti-truancy initiatives and curfews. The
       President's Child Care Initiative also quadruples funding for Department of
       Education-sponsored after school programs, and his Drug Strategy includes new funds
       for Safe and Drug-Free schools.

                  HONORING THE PAST -- IMAGINING THE FUTURE


We stand at the convergence of a new century and the next millennium -- a milestone in human
history. Five months ago the President and the First Lady created the White House Millennium
Council, to set some themes, engage the federal agencies and invite all Americans to participate
in meaningful activities through the year 2000.

Honor the past; imagine the future. The overall theme ofthe White House millennium
programs is "Honor the past; imagine the future." The President is inviting all Americans to
"give gifts to the future," to participate in projects that will enhance future generations.

Imagining the future. One of the best ways to imagine the future is to preserve what we value
of our past for the new millennium. Our history and culture are literally disintegrating in our
libraries, museums, archives, and at our historic sites and monuments.

Cherishing our past. That is why our Fiscal '99 Budget includes funds for some urgent
preservation needs: for the Smithsonian Institution to restore the Star Spangled Banner -- the
flag that flew over Fort McHenry and inspired Francis Scott Key's poem -- and for the National
Archives to re-encase the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights
before those precious founding documents are endangered.

A national effort. But all over the Nation, in states and communities, there is a pending loss --
from Revolutionary War monuments, to the papers and laboratory of Thomas Edison (in West
Orange, New Jersey) to other artifacts and sites that comprise our heritage.

      The President is proposing a Millennium fund -- $50 million in each of the next three
       fiscal years -- to stimulate a national effort to "Save America's Treasures." The fund
       would be administered through the Department of Interior. Halfwould be allocated for
       the most urgent preservation projects of regional and national significance, identified by
       the federal agencies and institutions. Halfwould go to the states, through the Divisions
       of Historic Preservation.

      The federal program should stimulate private efforts to raise money from corporations,
       foundations and individuals. The National Trust for Historic Preservation will create a
       high-level advisory committee that will direct funds to the urgent preservation needs
       identified at the national level and by the states.

      The "Save America's Treasures" program should be a bipartisan effort, to come together
       on something that will be good for the country -- and truly give a gift to the future.

             Restoring the American Dream, Reinforcing American Leadership,
                            Renewing the American Constitution

In the last five years President Clinton and Vice President Gore have led America in preparing
for the 21 st Century with a new vision of government -- a government that does not attempt to do
everything, nor a government that withdraws to the sidelines. The accomplishments of the
Clinton-Gore Administration are giving Americans the tools to realize our potential; providing
opportunity while demanding responsibility; and building One America in which all are
challenged to serve.


Economv: the Strongest Economy in a Generation

Balanced the Federal Budget -- The President's FY99 budget will be theftrst balanced budget
in a generation, after inheriting a record $290 billion deficit in 1992.

Over 14 Million New Jobs Created -- in last two years, over two-thirds in high-paying job
categories.
Lowest Unemployment in a Quarter Century -- down from 7.5% in 1992 to 4.7% today.
Typical Family Income Up $2,169 -- as adjusted for inflation, median family income has
increased three years in a row since 1993.

Highest Home Ownership Rate in History -- there are nearly 6 million new homeowners
since the President took office.


Families: Strengthening America's Working Families

$500 Per-Child Tax Credit -- 27 million families with 45 million children will receive the $500
per-child tax credit.

Tax Cuts for Working Families -- 15 million working families receive tax relief through the
President's expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.

Increased the Minimum Wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour -- increasing wages for 10 million.

Protecting Families -- Family Medical Leave allows workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid
leave to care for family members without fear of losing their jobs. More than 12 million families
have taken leave since its enactment.

Signed Landmark Adoption and Safe Families Act -- this law will help thousands of children
waiting in foster care move more quickly into safe and permanent homes.
                                                                  Automated Records Management .

Balanced the Federal budget -- The President's FY99 budget will be the first balanced budget
in a generation, after inheriting a record $290 billion deficit in 1992.

Over 14 million new jobs created. The economy has created more than 14 million new jobs
during the Clinton Administration -- a faster annual rate of job growth (2.5 percent per year) than
any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s.

Declining unemployment. The unemployment rate for Hispanics in December 1997 was 7.1
percent, down from 11.3 percent when President Clinton first took office.

Keeping inflation in check. Inflation has averaged 2.6 percent since President Clinton took
office -- compared to 4.2 percent in the twelve years before the President took office.

Strong private sector growth. Over the past year, the private sector grew an impressive 4.6
percent. Since taking office, private sector has grown 3.6 percent per year under President
Clinton.

Minimum wage increase. The President raised the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour -- directly
benefitting more than 1.6 million Hispanic workers.

Two and a half times more small business loans to Hispanic entrepreneurs. Between 1993
and 1997 the SBA approved nearly 15,000 loans to Hispanic entrepreneurs under the 7(a) and
504 loan programs. Last year alone, the Small Business Administration granted more than 3,300
loans, worth $615 million, to Hispanic small business owners, two and a halftimes the number
ofloans granted in 1992.

Expanded investment in urban and rural areas. Created over 120 Empowerment Zones and
Enterprise Communities and expanded access to capital through Community Development Banks
and Financial Institutions.


                              FIGHTING FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

Building One America. The President is leading the nation in an effort to become One
America in the 21 st Century: a place where we respect others' differences and, at the same time,
embrace the values that unite us. AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson
serves on the Advisory Board to the President's Initiative on Race, which the President charged
with overseeing this effort.
An Administration that looks like One America. Appointed the most diverse Cabinet and

of Energy Federico Pena; Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson; and Small
Business Administrator Aida Alvarez.

Judicial appointments. Seven percent of all judicial appointments are Hispanics including Jose
Cabranes, Judge, Second Circuit U.S. Circuit Court; David Briones, Judge Western Texas U.S.
District Court; and Jorge Rangel, Judge-designee Fifth Circuit U.S. Circuit Court.

Senior level Administration appointments. Appointed more Hispanics to senior level
positions than any President in American history, including U.S. Ambassador to Belize Carolyn
Curiel, Overseas Private Investment Corporation COPIC) President George Munoz; Assistant to
the President and Director of Public Liaison at the White House Maria Echaveste; Assistant to
the President and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs at the White House Mickey Ibarra;
Director of the United States Marshals Service Eduardo Gonzalez; and Commissioner of Bureau
of Reclamation Department of Interior Eluid Levi Martinez. Significantly, many of these
appointments are outside what had been considered the "traditional" Hispanic areas of interest.

Assessment of affirmative action programs. Ordered a comprehensive review of the
government's affirmative action programs which concluded that affirmative action remains an
effective and important tool to expand education and economic opportunity to all Americans.

Opposed California Prop 209. Filed amicus briefs opposing California Proposition 209,
which would prohibit state affirmative action programs.

Election fairness. Prevented election day discrimination against minority voters and voter
intimidation and harassment by monitoring polling place activities in a record number of states
and counties. Continued enforcement efforts to ensure that citizens who rely on Spanish have
the same opportunities to participate in voting-related activities as English-speaking voters.

Expanded voting rights. The Administration argued in federal court to expand the Voting
Rights Act and defended racially fair redistricting plans. The National Voter Registration Act or
"Motor Voter" law has registered at least nine million new voters and made voting easier for
more than 20 million Americans.

Opposed California Prop 187. Opposed California's Proposition 187, which would have made
        illegal immigrants ineligible for public school education at all levels and ineligible for
        public health care services, because of its detrimental impact on children and its threat to
        public health.
Investigated discrimination. Authorized investigations into discrimination practices by
lenders and property insurers to help end discrimination in the provision of home mortgages.

education, the President enacted the largest investment in education in 30 years -- and the largest
investment in higher education since the G.!. Bill -- by signing the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.

Increased funding for Hispanic-serving colleges. Last year, enacted an 11 % increase for
Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSls), colleges with at least 25% Hispanic enrollments.

Hispanic advisory commission. Established an advisory commission to oversee the
improvement in education for Hispanics and to ensure that Hispanic-serving institutions will
have more input regarding educational goals and issues of concern to Hispanics. The
Commission's report identified contributing factors impacting attainment of educational
excellence, corrective policy actions, and plans for program development and funding.

Student Diversity Partnership Program. Partnered with Hispanic Association of Colleges
and Universities, National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an Indian
Science and Engineering Society and the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science
and Engineering Education to implement the Student Diversity Partnership Program. This
program will ensure an adequate supply of diverse and qualified scientists and engineers for the
21 st century.

AmeriCorps college support. Since 1993, more than 100,000 people have had the opportunity
to serve through AmeriCorps, with Hispanics comprising 13 percent of all participants (1996
data). This year alone, nearly 50,000 young people will take advantage of the opportunity to
serve and will earn an award of up to $4,725 to pay for college or repay student loans.

Increased bilingual education by 35%. Last year, enacted a 35% increase in bilingual and
immigrant education secured by the President in the Balanced Budget Agreement. The bilingual
education funding will help school districts teach English to more than a million limited English
proficient children, as well as provide some 4,000 teachers with the training they need to do their
jobs better. The Immigrant Education program will help more than a thousand school districts
provide supplemental instructional services to 875,000 recent immigrant students.

Helping more children in elementary and secondary schools. In 1994, President Clinton
reformed Title I -- the major elementary and secondary program for disadvantaged
children -- clearing away barriers that had prevented limited-English proficient children
from getting help. Now Hispanics are 32% of the children served in Title I, the largest
share of all communities.

culturally-competent systems of care for children with serious emotional disturbances through
the Comprehensive Mental Health Services for Children and Families program. Negotiated
agreements with hospitals and nursing homes to eliminate barriers to equal access for minorities
based on language.

Increasing home ownership. Launched a program to increase the home ownership rate of
Hispanics in the U.S. through advertising, education and counseling programs and working with
lending institutions to better serve the Hispanic community. Progress has been made, 3.7
million Hispanics, or 43.3 percent, now own their homes.


                                        FIGHTING CRIME


White House Conference on Hate Crimes. President Clinton announced the first White
House Conference on Hate Crimes, which examined laws and remedies that can make a
difference in preventing hate crimes, highlighted solutions that are working in communities
across the country, and continued the frank and open dialogue needed to build One America.

Enhanced penalties for hate crimes. As part of the historic 1994 Crime Act, the President
signed the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act which provides for longer sentences where
the offense is determined to be a hate crime. In 1996 alone, 27 cases received enhanced
sentences.


                                SAFE AND CLEAN ENVIRONMENT


Environmental justice and redevelopment. Issued an Executive Order on Environmental
Justice, ensuring that low income citizens and minorities do not suffer a disproportionate burden
of industrial pollution. Identified pilot projects to be undertaken across the country to redevelop
contaminated sites in low-income communities and tum them into useable space, creating jobs
and enhancing community development.


                                         IMMIGRATION


Fairness for immigrants. The President worked with Congress to correct the most egregious
impacts of the I1\egal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. As a
result, almost a million people will be able to proceed with legalizing their immigration status
under the former standards of immigration law and not the new, stricter and more burdensome
standards enacted last year.
Restored benefits to legal immigrants. When the President signed the 1996 Welfare Reform
Law, he pledged to go back and change provisions he opposed regarding the cutting off of
benefits to legal immigrants. Critics said the changes would never be made. However, in 1997,
                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dwnp Conversion
1996 law. The President fought for and won $11.5 billion in SSI and Medicaid benefits for legal
immigrants. He won changes that protect those immigrants now receiving assistance, ensuring
that they will not be turned out of their apartments or nursing homes or otherwise left destitute.
And immigrants in this country as of August 22, 1996, but not receiving benefits who
subsequently become disabled will be eligible for SSI and Medicaid.

Naturalization. Made naturalization a top priority of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in order to continue fostering legal immigration while combating illegal immigration.
Naturalized over one million individuals in 1996. The Administration continues to work to
streamline and improve the naturalization process so that eligible individuals who have played by
the rules can become full partners in America.

Defended immigrant rights. The Administration defeated legislative efforts which would have
significantly eroded health care for immigrants. The bipartisan agreement strengthened the
sponsorship requirement while preserving the basic ability of families to reunify. "


                                    AMERICAN LEADERSHIP

Democracy for Cuba. Increased efforts to promote a peaceful, democratic transition in Cuba
by toughening sanctions after the brutal shoot down of U.S. civilian aircraft over international
waters and signing the Helms-Burton Act to penalize those who traffic in confiscated properties
in Cuba. Awarded a landmark $500,000 grant to Freedom House to assist human rights activists
in Cuba.

Support our closest neighbors. Took decisive action in assembling a financial support package
for Mexico. The President's leadership prevented a prolonged financial crisis in Mexico and its
spread to other Latin American countries.

                      Supporting Women and Families

EXPANDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES:

    Passed the Family & Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Family and Medical Leave enables
     workers to take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave to care for a new baby or ailing family member
     without jeopardizing their job. Twelve million families have already benefited from FMLA
     since its enactment. And the President proposed expanding the Family & Medical Leave Act to
     allow workers up to 24 hours per year of unpaid leave for parent-teacher conferences or routine
     medical care for a child.
    Cut taxes for 15 million working families by extending the Earned Income Tax Credit.
    Increased the Minimum Wage from $4.25 to $5.15, giving 6 million women a raise.
    Narrowed the wage gap. Last year, the median earnings of women working full-time increased
     2.4%. In 1996, the median earnings of women represented 74% of the median earnings for men,
      the narrowest gap ever.
    Highest home ownership rate in history. There are 67.1 million American families,
     including 15.2 million households headed by women, who own homes, nearly 6 million new
     homeowners since the President took office.

MAKING OUR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES SAFER:

    Putting 100,000 more police on the streets. Because of President Clinton's Crime Bill, over
     70,000 officers are already keeping our neighborhoods and communities safe, on the way to
     100,000. And violent crime has dropped five years in a row - the longest period of decline in 25
     years.
    Signed the Assault Weapons Ban into law as well as the Brady Bill, which has already kept
     guns out of the hands of 300,000 felons, fugitives and individuals under restraining orders related
     to domestic harassment. The President also signed into law an extension of the Brady Law,
     which prohibits anyone convicted of a domestic violence offense -- misdemeanor or felony --
     from owning or possessing a firearm.
    Signed Megan's Law allowing community-notification of sex offenders.
    Championed the Violence Against Women Act, the cornerstone of the President's efforts to
     fight domestic violence, and created an office at the Department of Justice dedicated to
     combating violence against women.
    More than tripled funding to domestic violence shelters and instituted new penalties against
     men who stalk, threaten or abuse women across state lines.
    Established nationwide 24-hour domestic violence hotline. The hotline ( 1-800-797 -SAFE)
     provides immediate crisis intervention, counseling and referrals for those in need. Since the
     hotline opened, there have been over 140,000 calls from all 50 States, the District of Columbia,
     Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

INVESTING IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING:

    Providing early education to more than 830,000 children with Head Start. 200,000 more
     children are enrolled in Head Start today than in 1992.
    Promoted national service and educational opportunities through AmeriCorps.

    world-class educational standards.
   Fought for passage of education tax breaks to promote lifelong learning. Representing the
    largest single increase in higher education since the G.I. Bill, the Balanced Budget includes a
    $1,500 Hope Scholarship to make the first two years of college universally available, and a
    20-percent tuition tax credit for college juniors, seniors, graduate students, and working
    Americans pursuing lifelong learning.

CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN:

   Held First-Ever White House Conference on Child Care and White House Conference on
    Early Child Development and Learning. In April 1997, the President and First Lady held the
    White House Conference on Early Child Development and Learning to highlight the benefits of
    early nurturing by parents. And in October 1997, the White House Conference on Child Care
    began a dialogue on the child care challenges facing parents today -- availability, affordability,
    and assuring safety and quality.
   Proposed the largest single investment in child care in the nation's history. Between FY93
    and FY97, federal funding for child care has increased by nearly 79%, providing child care
    services for over one million children. The President's new $20 billion child care proposal will
    double the number of children receiving child care subsidies to more than two million and
    increases tax credits for three million working families to help them pay for child care.
   Extended health care to millions of children with the Children's Health Initiative, the single
    largest investment in Health Care for children since 1965. The President fought to ensure that the
    Balanced Budget included $24 billion to provide meaningful health care coverage to millions of
    uninsured children.
   Fought for and won $500 child tax credit for 27 million families with 45 million children
    under age 17. Thirteen million children from families with income below $30,000 will receive
    the child tax credit as a result of the President's efforts.
   Signed Landmark Adoption and Safe Families Act. This law will help thousands of children
    waiting in foster care move more quickly into safe and permanent homes.

    fallen six years in a row, by 7.4 percent from 1991 to 1996.
   Imposed strict measures to keep cigarettes out of the hands of our children by restricting
    youth-targeted advertising; and the FDA made 18 the minimum age to purchase tobacco products
    nationwide, requiring photo l.D.s for anyone under the age of27.

EXPANDING ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE:

    Protected Medicare. Protected, modernized and extended the Medicare trust fund for at least a
    decade while offering new options for patient choice and preventive care.

    for an estimated 25 million Americans who move from one job to another, who are
    self-employed, or who have pre-existing medical conditions.
    Endorsed legislation that would ban drive-thru mastectomies, allowing women to stay in the
    hospital at least 48 hours following a mastectomy. And the President has also endorsed
    legislation that will prevent health plans from discriminating on the basis of genetic
    information.

PROMOTING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES FOR WOMEN:

   Reversed the "Gag Rule" limiting the information federally funded family planning clinics
    could give to women.

    grants by $15 million -- a 46% increase since FY92.
   Signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, establishing a safety-zone around
    women's health clinics.

GENERATING MORE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN:

   Women are starting businesses at twice the rate of all businesses. There are nearly 8 million
    women-owned businesses in the U.S., generating nearly $2.3 trillion in sales. The Small
    Business Administration's Office of Women's Business Ownership is working to foster this
    growth.
   Tripled the Number of Small Business Loans to Women Entrepreneurs. Between 1993 and
    1997 the SBA approved nearly 50,000 loans to women entrepreneurs under the 7(a) and 504 loan
    programs. Last year alone, the Small Business Administration granted more than 10,000 loans,
    worth $1.67 billion, to women small business owners, triple the number of loans granted in 1992.
    Conducted a survey over 250,000 working women to learn more about their workplace
    expenences.

WOMEN AS PARTNERS IN DECISION MAKING:

   41 percent of Administration appointees are women, by far the highest percentage appointed
    by any previous President. And women hold 29 percent of the top positions requiring Senate
    confirmation (PAS).
   Appointed the first women ever to serve as Attorney General, Janet Reno, and Secretary of
    State, Madeleine Albright. Including the Attorney General and Secretary of State, women make
    up 27 percent of the Clinton Cabinet: Alexis Herman, Secretary of Labor; Donna Shalala,
    Secretary of Health and Human Services; Carol Browner, Administrator of the Environmental
    Protection Agency; Janet Yellen, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors; and Charlene
    Barchevsky, United States Trade Representative.
   A third of all judicial nominees are women, the highest proportion ever.

                         STRONGER MORE ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION FOR ALL

President Clinton is proposing new initiatives that will dramatically strengthen elementary and secondary
education. These proposals will help ensure that all students start out in a small class with a good teacher, in
a safe, modern school. They will also help ensure that students, especially in high poverty urban and rural
areas, attend schools where high standards are taken seriously and kids are given the help they need to
succeed. The President's proposals will dramatically expand access to safe havens for after-school learning,
and ensure that low-income students receive the support and encouragement to finish school and continue-on
to college.

Reducing Class Size in Grades 1-3 to a Nation-Wide Average of 18. President Clinton is proposing a $12.4
billion initiative over 7 years ($7.3 billion over 5 years) to help local schools provide small classes with
qualified teachers in the early grades. This initiative will help ensure that every child receives personal
attention, learns to read independently, and gets a solid foundation for further learning. The new initiative
will reduce class size in grades 1-3 to a nationwide average of 18, providing funds to help local school districts
hire an additional 100,000 well-prepared teachers. The initiative will also provide funds to states and local
school districts to test new teachers, develop more rigorous teacher testing and certification requirements,
and train teachers in effective reading instruction practices. School districts will be accountable for
demonstrating gains in reading achievement. These steps will help ensure that first through third grade
students are receiving high-quality reading instruction in smaller classes from competent teachers.

Modern School Buildings to Improve Student Learning.               For students to learn, schools must be
well-equipped and able to accommodate smaller class sizes. To address these and other critical needs,
President Clinton is proposing federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds to build and
renovate public schools. This initiative provides more than double the assistance proposed last year --half
the interest on an estimated $20 billion in bonds. The tax credits will cost the Treasury $5 billion over 5
years and more than $10 billion over ten years. Of the $22 billion in bond authority, nearly $20 billion is for
 new School Modernization Bonds. Half of this bond authority will be allocated to the 100 school districts
with the largest number of low-income children, and the other half will be allocated to the States. In
addition, the President is proposing a more than $2.4 billion expansion of Qualified Zone Academy Bonds,
school-business partnerships that will include funding for school construction and renovation.

Education Opportunity Zones: Helping Students in Poor Communities Reach High Standards. This
initiative will strengthen public schools and help students master the basics where the need is the greatest: in
high poverty urban and rural communities where low expectations, too many poorly prepared teachers, and
overwhelmed school systems create significant barriers to high aChievement. The Education Department will
select approximately 50 high poverty urban and rural school districts that agree to: (I) use high standards
and tests of student achievement to identify and provide help to students, teachers and schools who need it;
(2) prevent students from falling behind by ensuring quality teaching, challenging curricula, and extended
learning time; and (3) end social promotion and turn around failing schools. Added investments in these
communities will accelerate their progress and provide successful models of system-wide, standards-based
reform for the nation. The President's initiative will invest $200 million in FY99, and $1.5 billion over 5
years, to raise achievement and share lessons learned with school districts around the country.

Expanding Access to Safe After-School Care. To help create safe, positive learning environments for
American school-age children who lack adult .supervision during a typical week, the President has proposed
to expand the 21st Century Learning Center Program to reach half a million children annually by investing
$1 million over five years. The program will support school-community partnerships that expand or
establish programs providing after-school care.

Early Intervention to Promote College Attendance. President Clinton will soon announce a long-term
effort to make college opportunity real for children in high-poverty areas by giving their families early
information about financial aid and academic preparation, and using mentors and other support services to
help the children stay on track through high school graduation and into college.

    THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS A CONCRETE PLAN OF ACTION
          THAT IDENTIFIES OUR PRIORITIES AND APPROACHES TO KEY ISSUES

   We have a unique moment in time to prepare America for the 21st Century. Under
    President Clinton's leadership, America has achieved an unprecedented period of
    peace and prosperity:
           -- the strongest economy in a generation;
           -- the first balanced budget in a generation;
           -- crime rates at their lowest levels in 24 years;
           -- welfare rolls down by 4.3 million people;
           -- unemployment at its lowest level in more than two decades;
           -- deficit cut by more than 90 percent;'
           -- unrivaled world leadership.

   This is an opportunity for action. The President's State of the Union address will
    challenge us to use this unique moment in time as an opportunity to prepare for the
    next century. It builds on the new kind of government President Clinton is creating
    -- a leaner, more flexible government. One that does not try to do everything. One
    that gives Americans the tools and conditions needed to make the most of their own
    lives.

   At the center of President Clinton's vision for a stronger America are three goals:
           -- an economy that honors opportunity;
           -- a society rooted in responsibility;
           -- and, a nation that lives as a community.

         HERE IS HOW THESE GOALS FIT INTO PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISION OF
                   A STRONGER AMERICA IN THE 21ST CENTURY:


   An Economy that offers more opportunity. The President will outline a plan for
    building a stronger, more prosperous America. Central to his strategy is:

          Driving the budget deficit down to O. During the first 5 years -- by making
           tough choices and fiscally responsible policies -- President Clinton took the
           nation's budget deficit down from $290 billion to $23 billion. This year,
           President Clinton will make history and give the American people their first
           balanced budget in 30 years.

          Reserving any budget surplus until Social Security is reformed. President
           Clinton is deeply committed to ensuring that Social Security remain a viable,

                                                          Alltomated Records Management!:'J ~." ...
                                                          Hex.텱ump Conversion
            century. That is why he is calling on Congress to secure Social Security for
            future generations as a first priority.

           Investing in the American people through education and training. Education
            is the key to opportunity. Tomorrow, President Clinton will ask us to make
            our public elementary and secondary schools the best in the world -- by
            raising standards, raising expectations and raising accountability. He will
            call for:
            -- voluntary national testing;
            -- 100,000 new teachers in grades 1-3;
            -- a School Construction Tax Cut to help rebuild, modernize, and build new
            schools;
            -- a mentoring program;
            -- continued college access expansion, so that every American who wants to
                                         can go to college.

           Tearing down trade barriers to open new markets for American products
            and workers. The President's plan seeks to renew his negotiating authority
            to open even more foreign markets to American goods and services. When
            countries hurt by economic instability are willing to undertake serious efforts
            to put their own economic houses in order, the President's plan calls for
            responsible action to give them a chance to implement their reforms. It also
            includes initiatives to enable all Americans to share in the prosperity of the
            global marketplace. Building on the funding for training we have provided
            to dislocated workers, the President will challenge Congress to pass the GI
            Bill for Workers to give workers a simple grant so they can move more
            quickly to newer, better jobs.

   A Society that Acts Responsibly. The President is intent on helping create a
    society that acts responsibly. To enforce this commitment, the President's plan will:

             Continue moving people from welfare to work. Challenge thousands
              more businesses to join the 3000 companies already in our
              welfare-to-work partnership.

             Health Care Consumer Bill of Rights. The President called on Congress
              to pass federally enforceable consumer health care protections before it
              adjourns this year. This Health Care Bill of Rights should contain a
              range of protections, including guaranteed access to needed health care
              specialists to ensure that patients are provided appropriate high quality
              care and access to emergency room services when and where they need it.

             Access to affordable, qualitv health care. Providing new options for
              Americans ages 55 to 65 to obtain Health Insurance, including
              opportunities to buy into Medicare.

             An historic child care initiative. To improve child care for America's
              working families the President is proposing approximately $20 billion
              over five years for child care, including elements to help working families
            the safety and quality of care, and promote early learning.
           Fighting juvenile crime and drugs. With murder, robbery, assault and
            burglary down all across the nation, President Clinton is calling for a
            special focus on addressing juvenile crime -- providing more resources to
            crack down on gangs, guns, and drugs. When coordinated with the
            support provided by the largest anti-drug budget in history and with the
            outstanding leadership General McCaffery brings to our national drug
            policy, these new efforts are sure to keep drug use on decline.

            Ensure our commitment to world leadership. The President is committed
             to keeping America strong by maintaining our role as the world's
             indispensable nation. This incudes:
             -- building an undivided, democratic Europe by expanding NATO;
             -- remaining a force for peace throughout the world;
             -- moving strongly against new threats to our security;
          -- reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction.

   Strengthening Our Communities. The President's plan helps strengthen
    America's communities by:

           Investing in our cities, giving them the tools and opportunities they need
            to continue an urban renaissance. President Clinton firmly believes that
            the best community development program, the best anti-poverty program,
            and the best jobs program is a growing economy. The President's plan
            helps our inner cities by:
            -- helping bring private enterprise into the inner city;
            -- increasing funding for empowerment zones;
            -- increasing funding for community development banks, to spur more
            investment and loans;
            -- providing tax incentives to develop affordable low income housing.

           Protecting the environment, ensuring a cleaner, healthier planet for our
            children. The President's plan invests:
            -- through $6 billion in tax cuts to businesses and individuals, the
            President's Climate Change Plan finds a way to grow the economy and
            reduce greenhouse emissions at the same time;
            -- large increases in research and development so we can find more and
            more innovative ways to continue cleaning the environment while keeping
            the economy strong.

           Helping the country become One America for the 21st Century. The goal
            of the President's Initiative on Race is to create a more just and fair
            society that underscores our shared strengths, instead of focusing on our
            differences. President Clinton is determined to continue his commitment
            with the Race Initiative in 1998 -- emphasizing that our national diversity
            is our greatest strength.

   Preparing for the Millennium. In conclusion, the President will talk of the
    importance of the Millennium and the opportunity it presents us to honor the past,
                 HEALTH CARE THAT STRENGTHENS AMERICA'S FAMILIES


Passing Comprehensive Bipartisan Tobacco Legislation That Reduces Teen Smoking and Changes
the Way Tobacco Companies Do Business. Every day 3,000 young people start smoking and 1,000
of them will die prematurely from a tobacco-related disease. The President called on Congress to
pass comprehensive national bipartisan legislation that includes five key principles: (1) it must
mandate the development of a comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including raising the
cost of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack over the next 10 years as necessary to meet youth smoking
targets; (2) it must affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products; (3) it must include
measures to hold tobacco companies accountable, especially for marketing products to children; (4)
it must include concrete measures to improve public health, from investing in research to reducing
second-hand smoke to expanding smoking cessation; and (5) it must protect the financial well-being
of tobacco farmers and their communities from the loss of income caused by our efforts to reduce
smoking.

Protecting Patients Through a Consumer Bill of Rights and Genetic Screening Protections. The
President called on Congress to pass federally enforceable consumer health care protections before
it adjourns this fall. This Health Care Bill of Rights should contain a range of protections,
including guaranteed access to needed health care specialists to ensure that patients are provided
appropriate high quality care --a particularly important protection for people with disabilities, access to
emergency room services when and where the need arises, an assurance that medical records are
confidential, and access to a meaningful internal and external appeals process for consumers to resolve
their differences with their health plans and health care providers. The nation's health care system has
changed dramatically, with more than 100 million Americans now in managed care plans. This legislation
will ensure that whether Americans have traditional health insurance or managed care, they are assured
quality care. And to ensure that new advances in genetics are used to improve health rather than to
discriminate, the President has called for legislation prohibiting the use of genetic screening to discriminate
in health insurance and employmEilt.

Providing New Options for Americans Ages 55 to 65 to Obtain Health Insurance, Including Buying
Into Medicare. Americans ages 55 to 65, particularly those with disabilities or preexisting
conditions, are one of the most difficult-to-insure popUlations: they have less access to and a greater
risk of losing employer-based health insurance; and they are twice as likely to have health problems
as the population generally. The President's proposal gives this vulnerable population three new
ways to gain access to health insurance by: (1) allowing Americans ages 62 to 65 to buy into
Medicare, through a premium that ensures that this policy is self-financed; (2) assisting vulnerable
displaced workers 55 and over by offering those who have involuntarily lost their jobs and health
care coverage a similar Medicare buy-in option; and (3) giving Americans 55 and over who have
lost their retiree benefits access to their former employers' health insurance.

Creating a Historic "21st Century Research Fund" With Unprecedented Increases in Biomedical
Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Scientists are on the cusp of important new
breakthroughs in biomedical research, which could revolutionize the way medical experts
understand, treat, and prevent some of our most devastating diseases. To promote this progress,
the President's budget contains a historic upfront investment in biomedical research --a 1.15 billion
increase in FY 1999 --and proposes an increase in NIH funding of more than 50 percent over the
                                                                                         Manaaement System

                   CHILD CARE THAT STRENGTHENS AMERICAN FAMILIES

"I am proud to propose the single largest child care invesanent in the history of our nadon. It is a comprehensive
and fiscally-responsible plan to make child care more affOrdable and accessible, to raise the quality and assure the
sarety of care fOr millions of American f8milies. This is an issue that touches nearly every famIly, vile that should
rise above politics and partisan interests. "
                                                                 President Bill Clinton
                                                                 January 7, 1998

President Clinton announced an historic initiative to improve child care for America's working families.
 The initiative proposes $21.7 billion over five years for child care, to help working families pay for child
care, build a good supply of after-school programs, improve the safety and quality of care, and promote
early learning.

ENSURING AFFORDABLE, ACCESSIBLE, SAFE CHILD CARE.         The President's child care initiative responds to the
struggles our nation's working parents face in finding child care they can afford, trust and rely on. The new
initiative:

        Makes child care more affordable for working families. To help working families struggling to meet the
        costs of child care, the initiative invests $7.5 billion oyer five years to double the number of children
        receiving child care subsidies to more than two million by the year 2003. The initiative also invests
        $5.2 billion over five years to increase tax credits for child care for three million families and provides a
        new tax credit for businesses that offer child care services to their employees.

        Increases access to and promotes early learning and healthy child development. To improve                 early
        learning, the initiative includes $3 billion over five years to establish an Early Learning Fund that     helps
        local communities improve the quality and safety of child care for children ages zero to five.             The
        initiative also increases investment in Head Start and doubles the number of children served by           Early
        Head Start to 80,000.

        Improves the safety and quality of child care. To help ensure safe, quality child care, the initiative: steps
        up enforcement of state health and safety standards in child care settings, facilitates background checks
        on child care providers. increases scholarships and training for child care providers, and invests in child
        care research and evaluation

        Expands access to safe after-school care. To help create safe, postnve learning environments for
        American school-age children who lack adult supervision during a typical week, the initiative increases
        the 21st Century Learning Center Program by $800 million over five years to provide after-school care
        for up to half a million children a year. The initiative will also improve coordination of federal
        after-school initiatives to help communities
