 TEXT:
 Attached is the latest version of the options paper for the principals.
 It now cont"ains a two-page cover memo, with a more extensive background
 paper.  I hope we're close to agreement on all of this "- I've tried to
 integrate some very different comments into this draft.   Please send any
 comments to me ASAP"

 As soon as I hear from you that you approve this draft, I'll ask Sally
 Katzen's office to schedule a Principal's meeting.   We need to move on
 this -- Commerce knows this process is under way and wants to get us in
 the room together with Census to talk about these issues very soon.  I
 hope we can get this draft approved today, and aim for a Principal's
 meeting no later than the beginning of next week.  As soon as a
 Principal's meeting is scheduled, I'll schedule a meeting with Commerce a
 few days later.  I assume you will all want to be invited to that meeting
 with Commerce (Commerce will decide who comes from the Census) .

 Note that I've made no changes to Pat's memo on eligibility.  Joe has
 promised (threatened?) a set of revisions from his staff, but I haven't


received them yet.    (I'm not sure that minor details need to be resolved
at this stage about the impact of the poverty thresholds on program
eligibility -- that will be the topic of any further work that goes
forward.  But do send me any potentially major disagreements.)

DRAFT BACKGROUND MEMORANDUM FOR EOP PRINCIPAL'S MEETING
     Jack Lew
     Bruce Reed
     Gene Sperling
     Janet Yellen

FROM:          EOP Policy Working Group on Income and Poverty Measurement

Subject:       Meeting on Income and Poverty Measures

Purpose of the Meeting

In early 1999, the Census Bureau will publish alternative measures of poverty based on the
proposals contained in the 1995 National Research Council report, Measuring Poverty: A New
Approach. The current official poverty measure dates back to the 1960s, and while it has been
an important contributor to public debate and policymaking, the NRC report reflects a broad
consensus that the measure is out-of-date and in need of revision.

Poverty measurement involves two concepts: (1) A definition of family income; and (2) A
"threshold" against which income is compared to determine if a family is poor. Changes in
these two concepts will have a direct impact on statistics used by the public for informational
purposes. Through the poverty "guidelines" (a simplified form of poverty thresholds, issued by
the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in HHS), a change in poverty
measurement is likely to have indirect effects on Federal programs as well.

Because of the importance of an independent statistical system, the Census Bureau plays the
major role in deciding technical issues regarding poverty measurement. However, because of
the important policy and political implications of the poverty concept, Census has asked for
advice from the EOP (which, through OIRA's Statistical Policy Office, is the statutory arbiter
of the "official" poverty measurement methodology) on their upcoming report. Note, if the
Congress had serious disagreement with the technical decisions made by Census, or saw a policy
or political opportunity, it could pass legislation to remove OIRA's legal authority to change the
official poverty concept. This could tum the concept of poverty into a political football, and
have adverse policy fallout as well.

In response to Census' request, CEA, DPC, NEC, and OMB formed a policy working group.
(Among the agencies, only the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Services Policy at HHS
was invited to participate because of her expertise on poverty measurement.) This working
group has held a series of meetings, and prepared the attached memo to outline its tentative
guidance to Census. The meeting ofEOP Principals is intended to review the working group's
conclusions before they are transmitted to Census. It is important to emphasize that we are only
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                     Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 2

being asked to give advice to the Bureau of the Census; what they actually publish is their
decision.

There are four global issues to be decided:

I) Should the Census Bureau highlight a single alternative poverty measure, or present several
equally in its forthcoming report? Do the principals have a single preferred measure that they
would like to see replace the current official measure? Would anointing a single measure at this
time be premature, and prejudge the analytical process? Would it raise ire in the Congress? If
we do not anoint a single preferred measure at this time, will it be difficult to select one later
should we want to switch the "official" definition to one of the proposed alternatives?

2) There are also two technical issues (policy options 1 and 4 in the background memo) that
require careful political consideration.

      Should we advise Census to benchmark the new poverty measure to the old poverty rate
       in the current year? What would be the implications of instituting the NAS
       recommendations that would result in a significally higher poverty rate?

      If there is only one measure reported by Census, the Deputies believe that measure should
       account for differences in medical out-of-pocket (MOOP) expenditures among
       households in the way recommended by the NAS, namely, subtracting them from income
       before a family's poverty status is calculated. Ifwe believe that several measures should
       be equally reported by Census, should one of them account for medical expenditures
       using a different methodology?

3) How should the Administration proceed after the Census report is released? Should it
proceed along a specific timetable to replace the current official measure before the end of this
Administration? If so, what process do we need to establish to move forward on this in a timely
fashion? Or, should the Administration proceed more cautiously, letting a consensus build
around a preferred measure among the community of users of poverty statistics, but possibly
endangering the chances that the official measure is ultimately changed?

4) In addition to OMB's designation of the "official" poverty measurement, HHS also issues
administrative poverty guidelines, used in certain program eligibility calculations. If revised
poverty thresholds are adopted as part of a new poverty measure, would the Administration
envisage continuing the old administrative poverty guidelines with some fonn of updating, or
would the guidelines be changed to be consistent with the new threshold measure? If the
guidelines are made consistent, would the Administration envisage programmatic changes to
mitigate the effects on eligibility and spending of switching to the new guidelines?
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

       TECHNICAL BACKGROUND ON INCOME AND POVERTY MEASURES


The Current Poverty Measure

The methodology by which current poverty thresholds are detennined was developed in the early
1960s by Mollie Orshansky, a staff economist at the Social Security Administration. She
developed a set of poverty thresholds that vary with the number of adults, the number of children,
and the age of the family head. These thresholds represent the cost of a minimum diet
multiplied by 3 to allow for non-food expenditures. The multiplier of 3 was chosen because the
average family in 1955 spent one-third of its after-tax income on food. Since the late 1960s, the
thresholds have simply been updated annually to adjust for price inflation -- i.e., the measure of
poverty has remained virtually unchanged for 35 years, despite substantial changes in family
behavior and govemment policy.

The NAS panel identified several weaknesses in the current poverty measure:

      The current poverty measure takes no account of changes in taxes (i.e., the expansion of
       the EITC) or in in-kind benefits (i.e., Food Stamps).

      The current measure does not distinguish between the needs of working and non-working
       families. In particular, it does not reflect the cost of child care and other work expenses
       for working low-income families.

      The current poverty measure takes noexplicit account of medical care costs, which vary
       significantly across families and have increased substantially since the current poverty
       measure was developed.

The NAS Recommendations

In order to understand the NAS panel's recommended revisions, one must understand the basics
of determining poverty. A family is considered poor when their resources fall below a
predetermined poverty line or threshold. Therefore, one must develop a methodology for
estimating family resources and for defining the threshold resource level below which a family is
considered poor.

1.     Defining Family Resources

For purposes of the current poverty calculation, the definition of family resources is cash income.
 The NAS recommendations would estimate family resources as:

Family resources              Cash income + Near-money in-kind benefits - Taxes - Child care
                              costs - Work expenses - Child support payments - Out of pocket
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion .


                                                     Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 4

                              medical care expenditures (including health insurance premiums)

The rationale for subtracting taxes, work and medical expenses from family resources is that
these expenditures are typically not discretionary and reduce the income available to a family for
economic survival.

There is near consensus among researchers that adjusting for near-money in-kind benefits
(primarily food stamps and housing subsidies) and taxes would be an improvement in how
poverty is measured. There is slightly less agreement on whether child care costs, work
expenses, and child support payments should also be deducted because an unknown proportion
of these expenses is likely discretionary. (The NAS proposes to cap the amount of child care
and work expenses that can be subtracted to deal with this problem.) As discussed below, the
adjustment for out-of-pocket medical care expenditures is more controversial.

2.     Defining a Poverty Threshold

A threshold must be determined against which to compare a family's resources. The NAS panel
 recommends basing the threshold on expenditures on "necessities" (food, shelter, and clothing)
plus a little more. Specifically, the NAS panel recommends selecting the 30th to 35th percentile
in the distribution of annual expenditures on food, shelter, and clothing all).ong families of four
(two adults and two children), and then multiplying this expenditure level by between 1.15 and
1.25. Thresholds for other family sizes and types would be determined by an equivalency scale
calculation.

The NAS recommends adjusting these thresholds to take into account geographic variation in
cost of living, based on differences in housing costs by region and by city-size. It also
recommends adjusting the thresholds over time by recalculating them from expenditure data on
an annual basis.


                                OPTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. Recommendations regarding which alternatives the Bureau of the Census should adopt
to determine the level of the poverty threshold.

The NAS panel acknowledges that the actual level at which the poverty threshold is set (and
hence the final poverty rate) is inherently arbitrary and cannot be determined on the basis of
purely statistical judgements. There are two primary options:

A. The NAS alternative. As described above, the NAS panel recommends establishing a
threshold based on the 30th-35th percentile in the distribution of annual expenditures for a family
of four, with a small multiplier to account for additional small personal expenditures. As
shown in Tables 1 and 2, column 3, this would raise the 1996 poverty rate from 13.7% to 18%,
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion        .


                                                     Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 5

and increase poverty among all subgroups.

B. Benchmarking. The NAS panel also considered poverty estimates that benchmark the
alternative poverty rate to equal the old poverty rate in a given year. The Census has done a
number of such benchmarked calculations for 1996, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, column 2.
(The report issued early next year would benchmark to 1997.) Benchmarking would assure that
the aggregate poverty rate is identical for the official and the alternative measure in the
benchmark year. But the distribution of poverty among subgroups within each measure would
differ (see Table 2). Similarly, both historical and future trends would differ. For instance, the
alternative measure is identical in 1996 but higher in 1991. (The faster fall using the alternative
measure is largely due to the expansion in the EITC.)

Pros of using the NAS measure:
      Incorporates the recommendations of the NAS panel, based on their judgement from the
       best available evidence.

      Generates dollar threshold levels that are quite similar to the current thresholds (although .
       the resources to which the thresholds would be compared are quite different).

Cons of using the NAS Measure:
     Results in a substantially higher poverty rate (although the trends over time are similar.)

Pros ofBenchmarking:
      May provide an easier transition to the new methodology because there will not be a
       change in the overall level of poverty.

      Focuses the arguments on the relative distribution of who is poor rather than how many
       people are poor. (Proposed changes in the relative well-being of different groups may be
       more defensible than proposed change sin the total number of poor.)

Cons ofBenchmarking:
     Violates the NAS recommendation that the threshold should be based on the 30th-35th
      percentile in the expenditure distribution. In order to benchmark, the threshold falls to
      (about) the 25th percentile of expenditures on food, shelter, and clothing.

The EOP Policy Working Group recommends benchmarking.


2. Recommendations regarding updating the thresholds over time

Currently the poverty threshold is updated annually using the CPI. This, however, does not
allow for adjustments that reflect changes in underlying consumption patterns that might affect
the revised thresholds. For instance, food prices have decreased relative to other goods over
                                                                 ex-Dump Conversion


                                                    Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 6

time, while housing prices have increased. There are two options:

(A) Recalculate the thresholds annually as a share of consumption on food, shelter, and clothing.
(This is recommended by the NAS panel.)

(B) Update the thresholds on a year-to-year basis using a price index (preferably one based only
on food, shelter and clothing). Implement a regular process (every 5-10 years) of reviewing the
poverty measure and recalculating the thresholds.

Pros ofRe-calculating the Thresholds:
      Regular recalculation will allow the poverty thresholds to reflect more accurately changes
       in consumption patterns and standards of living.

      Without an expectation that the thresholds will be re-calculated regularly, it may be hard
       to update them at all.

Pros of Updating Using the CPI:
      Using the NAS methodology, the poverty thresholds are somewhat relative (i.e., they are
       affected by changes in the distribution of household expenditures.) As a result, they are
       a moving target and do not provide an absolute standard of need. A cpr adjustment
       would make it easier to compare poverty from year-to-year against a constant standard.

      Because consumption patterns and standards of living change slowly, it may be better to
       take them into account periodically rather than annually.

      An update with a CPI for necessities only (food, clothing, and shelter) may capture most
       of the relevant changes and would make it easier in the short-run to understand the
       updating procedure.

      The data may not be good enough for an annual re-calculation of the thresholds.

The EOP Policy Working Group recommends Option (B).


3. Recommendation as to whether thresholds should be adjusted for geographic variation.

The NAS panel recommended adjusting the poverty thresholds for cost-of-living differences
across regions and by city size. Census proposes to make such adjustments based on housing
cost differences (which have much greater regional/city size variation than food or clothing.)

Pros ofAdjusting for Geographic Variation in Cost ofLiving:
      Most statisticians and economists agree that such adjustments should be made if data are
       available.
                                                     Prelimin~eD~~W-~oe:'f~g& HOLD.             Page 7


Cons ofAdjustingfor Geographic Variation in Cost ofLiving:
     There is no one "right" way to make such adjustments and the issue could be highly
      politicized.

        The data available to make such adjustments are limited and may not be entirely reliable.

        Implementing such an adjustment in the poverty line threshold could lead to pressure to
         provide regional cost adjustments in a wide variety of other government programs, from
         Social Security benefits to tax payments.

The EOP Policy Working Group recommends against geographic price adjustments.


    4. Recommendation regarding how to account for medical care expenditures.

 Since the mid-l 970s, analysts have been concerned that the official poverty rate overstates the
 extent of poverty among beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance. At
 the same time, the official poverty rate may understate the extent of poverty among populations
 with large medical expenditures. Most analysts agree that, in principle, medical care "needs"
 should be incorporated into the calculations ofthe threshold and family resources (i.e., families
 with higher medical needs should have higher thresholds; those with more generous medical
톌enefits should have higher income; and those who must spend more to achieve "good health"
 should have those expenses subtracted from their resources). However we cannot observe a
 family's medical need. In addition, it is not clear that one can simply impute the cash value of
 insurance benefits and add this to income. The "extra" benefits received from insurance to cover
 expensive medical services do not provide income that can be used for any other purpose.

To understand the difficulties, consider including medical benefits into the income calculations.
Adding medical benefits to income, without also adjusting the poverty threshold, has the perverse
effect of making sicker individuals appear better off. Other proposals to adjust the poverty
threshold (without also adjusting income) run into similar problems.

In the end, the NAS panel recommended subtracting all medical out-of-pocket (MOOP)
expenses (including health insurance premiums) from income, without trying to value health
insurance as a part of income or medical need as a part of the thresholds .. Hence, family
resources are measured net of MOOP. Those individuals with good insurance will have few
out- of-pocket expenses; those without insurance who face health problems will have lower
measured incomes as they pay more for medical care.

This adjustment accounts for the larger poverty rates using the NAS methodology. For example,
in 1996 the poverty rate was 13.7% using the current methodology; it would have been 18%
using the NAS methodology, but only 13.2% using the NAS methodology minus the medical
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                     Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 8

expenses adjustment. This adjustment nearly doubles the poverty rate for the elderly, raising it
almost to the rate for children. This adjustment is one of the most controversial of the NAS
recommendations.

There is general agreement that ignoring medical care and medical expenses entirely is not a
good idea, particularly given the rapid increase in medical costs in the past 30 years and the
extent ofuninsurance among the low-income population. Ignoring this issue -- particularly
given this Administration's concern with it -- is not a credible option. There are two other
alternatives:

(A) Follow the NAS recommendations and subtract MOOP from family resources. This makes
families with unreimbursed medical expenses less well-off than other families. (Note, there is
still an open discussion as to whether MOOP should be subtracted from family resources or
added to the thresholds. Either way, it will make little difference in aggregate. This is clearly a
technical decision that Census should address.)

(B) Try to impute the value of health insurance to income, so those with insurance have higher
resources. Health insurance should then also be imputed into the thresholds.

Pros ofAdjustingfor MOOP:
      While not perfect, under the NAS recommended adjustment families with higher
       unreimbursed medical expenditures will be "poorer." The NAS recommended
       adjustment would also be sensitive to changes in health care financing that would
       decrease MOOP and thereby increase disposable income and reduce poverty.

      Ifwe do not adjust for medical care (in some way) now, it may be much harder to do so in
       a few years when we will have better data (because the change will be so dramatic it will
       be viewed as another big methodology change).

Cons ofAdjustingfor MOOP:
     The data that are currently available are out-of-date, (but we should have updated
      information available in a more timely fashion within another year.)

      The NAS recommended approach relies on the controversial assumption that all medical
       care expenditures are nondiscretionary. (This concern could be mitigated to some extent
       by imposing a cap on the amount of medical expenses.)

Pros ofImputing the Value of Health Insurance into Resources and Thresholds:
      Provides a more complete accounting of all medical resources available to a family.

Cons ofImputing the Value ofHealth Insurance into Resources and Thresholds:
     There is no accepted "correct" way to do this. The data here are probably more
      unreliable than the data needed to impute the value of MOOP to families.
                                                                H econ s Management System
                                                                 ex-Dump Conversion

                                                     Preliminary Draft -- CLOSE HOLD. Page 9


      Many analysts agree with the NAS panel that the value of health insurance is quite
       different than (say) the value of food stamps, which are far more fungible. Mixing in
       health insurance coverage with economic need causes serious interpretational and
       conceptual problems to a measure of economic need.

      To date, Census has been following the NAS recommendations. Ifwe asked them to
       switch to this approach, it might require substantial additional work and seriously delay
       their report.

The EOP Policy Working Group recommends option (A).


5. Recommendations regarding which alternatives Census should publish and/or how
they should be presented.

The current plan is to publish a small number (maybe 3) of alternatives. For instance, the
Census could publish a 1997-benchmarked poverty rate and a NAS-alternative poverty rate,
providing two alternatives. Or it could publish a 1997-benchmarked poverty rate including all
ofthe NAS recommendations, and then publish the same thing without MOOP, or without
geographical price variation. (There will be extensive appendices in this report that will report a
wide variety of different poverty calculations, to demonstrate the 'statistical properties of the
poverty measurement recommended by NAS.)

      Will it be confusing to publish multiple (even a small number) of alternatives, as opposed
       to only one alternative? How will-this affect how the report is received? How should
       these be presented?

      What problems will it create to have multiple alternatives if at some future point we
       want to redefine the official poverty rate to one of these improved alternative measures?

                                    Attachment 1 (from HHS)

    Use of the Federal Poverty Guidelines in Determining Program Eligibility and Benefits

 The Federal poverty guidelines are a simplified version of the official poverty line thresholds
 which are used for program purposes. They are issued by HHS annually, and are based on the
 previous year's thresholds .

. As Gordon Fisher, the analyst at HHS who oversees the production of the guidelines, notes in a
  recent paper:

        A number of people believe that the poverty guidelines affect many big entitlement
        programs. That belief is an exaggeration of the actual situation. Most of the Federal
        programs using the guidelines are medium-sized or small, with only a few big programs.
        Moreover, most...are discretionary programs ... Only a few programs using the guidelines
        are mandatory: Medicaid, the Food Stamp Program, and child nutrition programs (mainly
        the National School Lunch Program.)1

 As Fisher notes, spending under discretionary programs, which are appropriated each year, would
 not be affected by any change in the guidelines, even if that change affected eligibility for the
 program. If eligibility for these programs expands, the appropriated funds are able to serve a
 smaller proportion of the eligible population, but total spending does not change. (Most of these
 programs already serve only a small fraction of those estimated to be eligible.) Only the three
 big mandatory programs Fisher mentions above would have spending changes associated with a
 change in the guidelines.

 Even within these three programs, the impact of changes in the poverty guidelines is less than
 might be expected. In Medicaid, for example, most recipients qualify for coverage because of
 their participation in other means-tested programs such as TANF and SSI--programs that do not
 use the poverty line in their eligibility criteria. The major group whose coverage does depend on
 the guidelines is children in families below 133% of the poverty line who are not current or
 recent T ANF recipients. In all, people whose eligibility for Medicaid is somehow related to the
 poverty line are estimated to account for about 20 percent of Medicaid recipients. Since most
 are in families with incomes well below the specified level, only a small fraction would actually
 be affected by a poverty line change.

 Impacts in the Food Stamp Program arid the National School Lunch Program would probably be
 even smaller. The poverty guidelines are used in the Food Stamp Program to set gross income
 eligibility--only families with gross incomes below 130% ofthe poverty line are eligible for food

stamps. Actual food stamp benefits are calculated based on net income, however--income after
deductions for work expenses and other items. Net income is compared to a specific benefit
allotment, determined nationally for each family size, and that benefit is reduced by 30 cents for
every dollar of net income the family receives. In practice, the benefit allotment would reach
zero for almost all families long before an income of 130 percent of poverty was reached. Thus,
the gross income eligibility cut-offfor food stamps is more theoretical than real--families at or
near 130% of the poverty line will almost always be eligible only for zero benefits.

The National S~hool Lunch Program has two cut-offs related to the poverty guidelines: Families
with incomes below 130% of poverty are eligible for free lunches, and those below 185% are
eligible for reduced-price lunches. Unlike the Food Stamp and Medicaid Programs, however,
the school lunch program does not collect and verify detailed information on recipients' family
incomes. Instead, families are asked at the beginning of each school year (or when their child
enters a new school) to fill out a form certifying that their incomes are below the specified level.
Because this process is relatively informal, it seems unlikely that small changes in the level of the
income cut-off would have big impacts on the number of children applying for and receiving free
and reduced-price school lunches. In any case, total spending on the school lunch program--a
significant proportion of which is not means-tested--is much smaller than spending on Medicaid
and food stamps. In 1996 Federal spending on the school lunch program was $5.4 billion,
compared to $25.4 billion for food stamps and almost $92 billion for the Federal share of
Medicaid.
