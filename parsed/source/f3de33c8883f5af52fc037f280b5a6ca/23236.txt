                      Fails to Extend Solvency of Social Security and Medicare
                                and Dramatically Cuts Key Priorities
                                                        March 18, 1999

Building on the success of six years of fiscal discipline and the virtuous economic cycle it created, President
Clinton has proposed a budget that includes a more than $3.4 trillion debt reduction lock-box that extends the
solvency of Social Security until 2055 and extends Medicare's solvency for more than a decade. It invests in
education and a cleaner environment, and provides a pro-savings tax cut to help American families build wealth
through new Universal Savings Accounts (USAs). The Republicans have responded by proposing a budget
that:
                     Fails to extend the solvency of Medicare and Social Security.
                     Forces dramatic cuts in key priorities -- more than 10% in 2000 and more than 20% in 2004.
                     Chooses instead a large tax cut targeted away from the middle class.
Fails to Extend Medicare Solvency
A year ago, in a radio address response [February 7,1998], Chairman Domenici said, "I believe that we should
save Medicare first." In the Senate Budget Committee, he said, "for every dollar you divert to some other
program you are hastening the day when Medicare falls into bankruptcy. " [Committee on Budget Mark-up, March 18,
1998] President Clinton's plan allocates 15 percent of the surplus over 15 years (or $686 billion) to Medicare,
and extends its solvency by more than a decade. Congressional Democrats share the President's determination
to allocate 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare. However, the Republican budget:
 Does not extend Medicare solvency by one day.

         Does not set aside even one penny of the surplus to strengthen Medicare.

Fails to Extend Social Security Solvency
         The Republican budget would do nothing to extend the solvency of Social Security. President Clinton's
          plan, according to the Social Security's independent actuary, extends the solvency of Social Security until
          2055. Even if the Republican budget carries out any debt reduction, it does not apply the benefits of this
          debt reduction to Social Security. The solvency of Social Security is not extended by one day. At the
          same time, the Republicans are placing top priority on a tax cut that explodes in cost right when the baby
          boom approaches retirement
         The Republican lock-box's debt mechanism would ''preclude the United StatesJrom meetings its future
          obligations to repaying maturing debt and to honor payments -- including benefit payments -- and could
          also run the risk of worsening a future economic downturn." [letter from Secretary Rubin to Senator Daschle, March
          17,1999].

Forces Dramatic Cuts in Key Priorities: More than 10% in 2000 and roughly 25% in 2004
The Republican budget dramatically cuts the funds available for key domestic priority programs that have in the
past received bipartisan support. The severity of these required cuts demonstrates that the Republican budget
is unrealistic and unworkable. After factoring in Republican commitments made in their budget -- on tax cuts,
defense, education, NIH -- remaining programs would be slashed more than 10 percent in 2000 and more
than 20 percent in 2004. If cut across-the-board, the Republican budget could mean that in 2000 alone:
             Up to 100,000 children would lose access to Head Start.
             About 2,700 FBI agents would be cut
             More than 1.2 million low-income women, infants, and children would lose WIC nutrition assistance.
                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
       More than 73,000 summer jobs and training opportunities would be eliminated for low-income young
       people.
       Implementation of IRS organizational restructuring, which was mandated by bipartisan IRS Reform,
       would be delayed one year.
       1,000 meat and poultry inspectors would be laid off or furloughed, undermining food safety.
       Cuts to Health Resources and Services Administration's health services for women and children,
       uninsured people and people with AIDS could prevent 2.9 million people from receiving health care
       services.
       Tenant-based rental assistance would be denied to 1,300 families. Funds wold be lost for new
       construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of over 10,000 affordable housing units.
       About 1,350 Border Patrol agents would be cut and the number of detention beds to incarcerate
       criminal aliens and illegal border crossers would be reduced by 5,200.
       7,500 low-income older Americans would lose their part-time jobs.
       Funding would be eliminated for the clean-up of 21 Superfund toxic waste sites -- needlessly
       jeopardizing public health for citizens living near affected sites and making it more difficult to meet the
       900 site cleanup goal in 2002.
       The National Park Service budget would be cut by $215 million. Most seasonal workers could not be
       hired, resulting in widespread cutbacks in visitor services, seasonal programs, and hours of operations at
       378 park units serving almost 300 million visitors annually.
By 2004, the above cuts would be twice as severe -- more than 20 percent across the board. More than 200,000
children would lose access to Head Start, and more than 6,000 FBI agents would be cut -- and so on down the
line.

Chooses Instead a Large Tax Cut Targeted Away from the Middle Class
The Republican budget reserves the on-budget surplus for a tax cut. Moreover, any increase later this year in
CBO's surplus projections would also go for a tax cut. In a list of possible tax cuts, the first one listed is the
flagship Republican tax cut -- an across-the-board income tax cut. As noted by a wide range of observers, this
tax cut would be targeted away from the middle class and disproportionately benefit taxpayers with extremely
high incomes:
      Citizens for Tax Justice found that the top one percent of taxpayers, who have incomes above $301,000,
       would receive a tax cut of$20,697, compared to just $99 a year for the bottom 60 percent offamilies.
      The Joint Tax Committee estimates that 48 million families would receive no tax cut at all.
      As Representative Nancy Johnson (R-CT) has said, "when you do an across-the-board cut it tends to
       help the top earners the most." [Washington Post, February 23, 1999]. And as Commentator George Will has
       observed: "i/you cut taxes across the board, the lion's share of the money is going to go to upper-
       income people." [ABC's This Week, 2114/99]
