                          Reducing Violence in the Lives of Children
                                    December 29, 1998

Announcement: President Clinton will launch a new Children Exposed to Violence Initiative
(or CEVI) designed to improve the justice system's response to children who are victims and
witnesses to violence. CEVI will include four components: (1) improving law enforcement
response; (2) reforming state and federal laws on child abuse and neglect; (3) increasing public
awareness; and (4) strengthening local prevention and intervention. To get this new effort
underway, the President will also announce the availability of $1 0 million in "Safe Start" grants
from the Justice Department. These new funds will help up to 15 cities reduce the impact of
family, school and community violence on young children in their communities.

The Need for Action

      Too many child victims. Not only do adolescents (12- to 17-year olds) represent
       approximately 25 percent of all violent crime victims nationally, but millions more are
       exposed to violence in other ways as well. In fact, of the nation's 22.3 million
       adolescents, almost 9 million have witnessed serious violence -- with nearly 2 million
       suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

      Child victims more at risk. Equally troubling is the fact that children who are abused,
       neglected and otherwise victimized or exposed to violence are more likely to become
       criminals themselves. They are more than 50% as likely to be arrested while a juvenile
       -- and nearly 40% as likely to be arrested when they become adults. They are also at
       significant risk for substance abuse, mental illness and suicide.

What CEVI Will Do

      Improve Law Enforcement Response. CEVI's first goal will be to improve the justice
       system's overall response to child victims and witnesses. This means providing law
       enforcement agents, prosecutors, victim and witness coordinators, and court personnel
       with the critical information and training they need to prevent against the "secondary
       victimization" of child victims and witnesses. To meet this need, CEVI will produce and
       distribute specialized training videos, best practice manuals, and other in-the-field user
       guides -- such as Forming a Multidisciplinary Team to Investigate Child Abuse, which
       will be released by the Justice Department today. CEVI will also work to help state and
       local law enforcement utilize Child Death Review Teams to investigate suspicious child
       fatalities; expand victims assistance programs; help create "Court Schools" that acclimate
       children to the courtroom setting; and other similar programs.

      Reform Laws Dealing with Child Victims and Witnesses. As part of CEVI, the
       Justice Department will develop federal and model state legislation that increases
       penalties for violent crimes affecting children, demands accountability from those who
       kill children through abuse or neglect, and generally improves the court system's ability
       to address the unique needs of child victims and witnesses.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

   Increase Public Awareness. CEVI will sponsor a National Summit on Children
    Exposed to Violence and hold follow-up forums to help implement recommendations
    from the Summit. The Summit will be co-hosted by the Department of Health and
    Human Services, major child advocacy organizations, the American Bar Association, and
    many others. Its goal will be to bring together experts in law enforcement, mental
    health, child development, and other related fields -- and to jointly develop a blueprint for
    national, state and local action that will address the issue of child victimization.

   Strengthen Prevention and Intervention. One ofCEVI's most important goals will be
    to help develop and promote local initiatives that: (1) prevent violence against children by
    promoting parent education; (2) intervene and provide services to children exposed to
    violence; and (3) support children within the justice system. A good example of such an
    initiative is the New Haven Child Development/Community Policing (CD-CP) program.
    A partnership between the New Haven Police Department and the Yale University Child
    Study Center, the New Haven CD-CP cross-trains law enforcement and mental health
    professionals and coordinates their response to children in violent situations. Over the
    past few years, the Administration has provided seed funds to help bolster the work of the
    New Haven CD-CP and to help replicate its success in other cities (e.g., Charlotte, NC;
    Nashville, TN; Baltimore, MD; and Chelsea, MA). Today, the President will announce
    the availability of $1 0 million in "Safe Start" grants to help up to 15 more cities
    implement proven initiatives like the New Haven CD-CPo
