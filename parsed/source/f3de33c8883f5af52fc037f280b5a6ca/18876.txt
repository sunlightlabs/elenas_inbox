                                       President's Medicare Buy-In Proposal

        As part of their analysis of the President's Budget, CBO did an analysis of the Medicare buy in.
        Their analysis found that:

        ·   No Trust Fund Impact: The net cost of the Medicare buy-in, according to CBO, is $300
            million over 5 years - only fractions of a percent of Medicare spending.

        ·   More participants: Participation is estimated to be over 33 percent higher than what the
            Administration estimated - 410,000.

        ·   Lower cost: The post -65 premium that people ages 62 to 65 would pay is only $10 per month
            per year - $6 per month and $72 less per year than Administration estimates. I

        Premiums in 1999:
              62 to 65 Year aIds                               $310 per month        (Administration: $305)
              Post-65                                          $10 per month per year (Administration: $16)
              Displaced Workers                                $400 per month       .(Administration: $400)

        I. Although the base premium is slightly higher, overall premiums are much lower since the post-65 premium,
        which is $6 less per month, would be paid every year until age 85.
