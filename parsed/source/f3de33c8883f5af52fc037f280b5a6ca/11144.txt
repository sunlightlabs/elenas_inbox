                           PRESIDENT CLINTON:
              EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR NATIONAL SERVICE
                              **2/9 DRAFT**

Today, at the University of Maryland, College Park, President Clinton called on Congress to
expand the yearly participation level in AmeriCorps to 100,000 members by 2002. He also
kicked-off AmeriCorps' largest national recruitment campaign to challenge young people to
provide service to their communities.

EXPANDING AMERICORPS TO GIVE MORE AMERICANS A CHANCE TO SERVE.
When he came into office in 1993, President Clinton outlined a vision for a national service
program that linked responsibility to opportunity by allowing young people to serve our
nation while earning funds for a college education: The result of that vision is AmeriCorps,
which is bringing people of different racial, ethnic and economic backgrounds together to
solve community problems and improve the lives of Americans. In the four years since its
launch, over 100,000 AmeriCorps members have risen to the challenge. They have tutored
children in school and after school, organized block watches and book drives, renovated housing
for low-income families, and recruited people in the neighborhood to volunteer alongside them.

The President seeks to build on this success by creating more opportunities for Americans
to serve through AmeriCorps. President Clinton's budget proposes to expand
AmeriCorps to nearly 70,000 members by the year 2000, with the goal of reaching 100,000
members serving each year by 2002. This expansion will also allow high school students to
join AmeriCorps-- by serving part-time during the school year and full-time during the
summer. The FY 2000 budget request includes $585 million for AmeriCorps, an increase
of $113 million over last year.

A CALL TO SERVICE CAMPAIGN. President Clinton announced the launch of the
AmeriCorps Call To Service campaign, the largest-ever national recruitment drive for
AmeriCorps. The President challenged all Americans, especially young people, to get
involved in service. The Call to Service campaign will provide young people with
information on how they can serve in AmeriCorps to help strengthen local communities.
The campaign includes a new television public service announcement produced by MTV,
print advertisements, campus visits and other local recruitment efforts.

A PROVEN RECORD OF SUCCESS. In just four years, over 100,000 young people have
joined AmeriCorps to serve more than 4,000 communities. AmeriCorps provides needed
human resources to schools churches, community groups and nonprofit orgranizations,
including Habitat for Humanity, Big BrotherlBig Sister and the American Red Cross. A
recent evaluation confirms that AmeriCorps strengthens communities in many ways: building
leadership, citizenship, and other important skills; and making community organizations more
effective. Since 1994, AmeriCorps members have served more than 32 million people,
mobilized nearly 2 million volunteers, taught, tutored or mentored more than 2 million children,
organized after-school programs for more than a half million at-risk youth, helped more than
200,000 senior citizens live independently and built or rehabilitated more than 25,000 homes.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


After a year of full-time service, AmeriCorps members receive education awards to help finance
college or pay back student loans.

 AmeriCorps Expansion

 What is the President proposing in his budget for the expansion of AmeriCorps?
 President Clinton has called for a major expansion of AmeriCorps in his FY 2000 budget, giving
 thousands more Americans the chance to serve their country and help meet pressing social needs.
  The budget proposes $585 million for AmeriCorps, an increase of $113 million over last year.
 This level would support 69,000 AmeriCorps members next year, growing to reach 100,000
 members per year by 2002. This expansion would include participation in AmeriCorps by high
 school students serving full-time in the summer and part-time during the school year. The
 proposal builds on growing bipartisan support for AmeriCorps: Congress has increased
 AmeriCorps funding two years in a row, by $49 million in fiscal 1998 and $18 million last year.

 AmeriCorps and Military Recruitment

 The New York Times reports that the military is having significant problems meeting its
 recruiting requirement. Will the AmeriCorps' recruitment effort worsen this problem?

 The President is committed to strengthening opportunities for young people to engage in service
 to this country -- be it through the military, AmeriCorps, the Peace Corps or any of the other
 national service programs. The Department of Defense examined this question and concluded in
 its 1998 Annual Defense Report: "The Department has looked at the potential impact ofNati'onal
 Service on military recruiting, and believes that both programs can coexist successfully."

 Do the military and AmeriCorps coordinate their respective recruiting efforts?

 The Corporation for National Service and the Defense Department share information and
 coordinate efforts where it makes sense to do so. For example, the Defense Department shares
 information about AmeriCorps with applicants who may not meet the unique physical
 requirements for military service. In addition, the Corporation provides the military with access
 to its career nights and outreach events so that AmeriCorps members have a full appreciation of
 the military career choices available to them.

  How do AmeriCorps' financial benefits compare with the military's financial benefits?
  Because each organization has particular needs, the benefits are different and they are generally
  set by law or regulations. During a term of service, military pay is generally higher than the
. average living allowance afforded to national service participants. Moreover, most national
  service programs are not residential so members are responsible for their own food and housing.
  The post-service educational benefit for a national service participant is set by law at $4,725 for a
  full year of service, with a maximum of two awards. The Department of the Army recently
                                                                     llt:x-Dump Com crsion

announced an increase in its maximum college tuition benefit to $50,000.

AmeriCorps Program

What do AmeriCorps members do?
AmeriCorps, the domestic Peace Corps, gives citizens the opportunity to engage in full-time
service to their community. Working through a grassroots network of more than 1,000
national and local non-profit and faith-based organizations, AmeriCorps members help
build stronger communities. In four years, AmeriCorps members have taught, tutored or
mentored more than 2 million youth; organized after-school programs for more than
500,000 at-risk youth; established 4,000 safety patrols; built or rehabilitated more than
25,000 homes; planted more than 52 million trees; arranged immunizations for nearly
half-million people; and recruited, trained or supervised nearly 2 million volunteers.

Where do AmeriCorps members serve?
Since it was established, AmeriCorps members have served in more than 4,000
communities. .AmeriCorps members work with national nonprofits like the American
Red Cross, Boys and Girls Club, the YMCA, Teach for America, Habitat for Humanity,
and faith-based organizations like Lutheran Social Services, the Catholic Network of
Volunteer-Services and the National Council of Churches and with hundreds of smaller
community-based organizations.

How many people are part of AmeriCorps?
Since it was launched four years ago, more than 100,000 men and women have served in
AmeriCorps. This year alone, more than 40,000 AmeriCorps members are working with
more than 600 organizations to serve more than 2,500 communities.

What is the average cost per AmeriCorps member?
The average cost per member is $16,000. This includes a living allowance, an education
award and costs associated with program administration. As part of a bipartisan
agreement reached in March 1996, with Senator Grassley, AmeriCorps is cutting costs
significantly. The cost of AmeriCorps has been but by $1000 per member each year. The
Corporation for National Service has already successfully lowered the costs per member to
$16,000 in the current grant year and is on track to cut the cost per member to $15,000 next
year.

Tara (T.J.) Trimmer is an AmeriCorps member serving with Public Allies, D.C. and Mentors
Inc. After a rough childhood that included running with gangs, and doing time in juvenile
detention by age 15, T.J. graduated from Eagle Rock, an alternative school for at-risk youth
founded by American Honda in Estes Park, Colorado. Last year, TJ. joined AmeriCorps and
now serves with Public Allies, D.C., where she recruits adults to serve as mentors to at-risk youth
and coordinates activities, providing support for the mentors and their proteges.

Justin Ward joined AmeriCorps in the summer of 1998 after graduating from University of
Maryland at College Park. He serves as Volunteer Coordinator for Harford County Habitat for
Humanity in Aberdeen. In just five months, Justin has revived the chapter and dramatically
increased its productivity, recruiting more than 100 new volunteers who have finished one home
and started another.

Leslie Mayo, a second year AmeriCorps member with Montgomery County Police Department's
AmeriCorps program, touches the lives of more than 300 persons with mental illness or
developmental disabilities everyday. A single mother with twins, Leslie says "My AmeriCorps
service has taught me that change begins within and that we all have something to share.
AmeriCorps has allowed me to see the difference that I can make."

Susan Carrasco (Pepe) graduated from Creighton University with a degree in chemistry. After
working as a chemist with a branch of the Army Corps of Engineers, Susan joined
AmeriCorps*NCCC and moved to Washington, DC. Susan now specializes in disaster relief.
Last spring she fought forest fires in Florida -- and this fall she led a team of members to Puerto
Rico to help relief efforts following Hurricane Georges. Currently Susan's team is serving with
the DC Housing Authority to improve public housing.

Stephen Hellinger who will introduce you, serves at Edgecombe Circle Elementary School in
Baltimore, where he teaches art and pairs inner-city youth with elderly residents. A refugee
from South Vietnam, he was raised in Lancaster, Pa. While in Vietnam, he contracted polio and
was told-that he would be confined to a wheelchair. He proved the doctors wrong and went on
to complete though, and has made service to others a mainstay in his life. Just last week, for
example, he assisted a victim of a drive-by shooting outside the elementary school where he
serves.
