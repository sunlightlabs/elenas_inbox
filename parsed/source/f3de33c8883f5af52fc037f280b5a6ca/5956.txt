SUBJECT:              White House Conference on Strengthening Public Education and related
                      events

We are proposing four high visibility education events, to be implemented between the State of
the Union Address and the end of the school year in June, that will provide a number of
opportunities for the President to highlight and demonstrate broad support for his education
agenda.    As a package, these events will underscore the President's committment to
strengthening public education by raising standards, promoting public school choice, investing in
quality and promoting accountability, and draw a contrast with the Republican agenda of
promoting vouchers and abandoning public schools.

The proposed events, listed in the order in which they should occur, are:
      A roundtable discussion with business leaders showcasing employer efforts to support
       high standards.
      A Mayor's Conference on Public Schools, with Presidential participation
      A conference on effective approaches to increasing high school graduation rates, with a
       special emphasis on Hispanics
      A White House Conference on Strengthening Public Schools, featuring local success
       stories that reflect the Administration's agenda.

These events are described in more detail below.


1. Roundtable Discussion on Business Community "Transcript Project"

Background: The Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National
Alliance of Business have endorsed the President's proposal for voluntary national tests. They
have also each endorsed a common policy statement on the importance of high standards in
education, one key part of which calls on employers to underscore the importance of both setting
and meeting standards by examining the high school transcripts or other evidence of academic
achievement of prospective employees. This builds on a commitment business leaders made at
the 1996 National Education Summit, to implement hiring practices that will require entry-level
job applicants to demonstrate high school academic achievement, and to send a powerful
message to students that performance in school counts.

More than 500 employers around the country have already begun to implement this initiative, as
part of broader business/education partnerships working in collaboration with local school

                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
Chemical and Eastman Kodak are the leading companies implementing and promoting this idea.

BRT, NAB and the Chamber, along with ACHIEVE (led by Lou Gerstner of IBM) have asked
for the President to endorse their efforts (know as the "Transcript Project") and give them
additional visibility.

The Event: A roundtable discussion involving the President, key national business leaders
(including Lou Gerstner), education leaders, and local employers, educators and current and
former students, focused on business efforts locally and around the country to send kids the
message that academic performance counts.

The business groups have identified a number of communities/states where this initiative is
working especially well, and which could serve as ideal sites for an event. These include
Orange County CA, Rochester NY, Berks County PA, and Kingsport TN.

Key news hooks would be an announcement of the 500+ businesses already signed on and a
President challenge to other employers; a strong call from the business groups for Congress and
states to support the national tests; and, possibly, support from the business community for the
President's Education Opportunity Zones initiative.

With sufficient advanced notice, the business groups would be willing to help amplify the event
by using the Chamber of Commerce's satellite capability to transmit the event to local
business/education partnership events they would organize throughout the country.

Time frame: February - mid March.


2. U.S. Conference of Mayors Conference on Public Education

Background: Earlier this year the u.s. Conference of Mayors approached us about a possible
joint White House/USCM Conference on Public Education, as a vehicle to highlight the
emerging leadership role of mayors in education, to encourage additional mayors to play
important leadership roles in local education issues, and to give the mayors a greater voice in the
national education discussion.

Heightened involvement of mayors in education is good for education, and mayors are an
important source of support for our education initiatives, ranging from America Reads to the
national tests. DPC, NEC, OIA, [other offices?] believe it is important to find a way to respond
positively to the USCM request. However, there has also been concern that a joint conference
with the Mayors alone could alienate much of the education community and lead to conflicts
with governors.

OIA and DPC staff have met with representatives of USCM and its chair, Mayor Daley in order
to better understand the USCM objectives and proposal. After several discussions, we have

The Event: The President would host a 1-2 hour meeting (pool spray, then closed press) with
mayors to discuss public education. This meeting would occur the morning after a day-long
Mayors Conference on Public Education, organized by the U.S. Conference of Mayors .. The
participants will be mayors, though local education leaders, school board members and teachers'
organizations will be invited to participate as well. The White House and Education
Department will work closely with USCM on the development of the program, to ensure that the
agenda reflects Administration priorities to the maximum extent possible. As appropriate,
Administration officials will participate in the conference.

This arrangement enables us to strengthen our ties with the mayors over education issues,
without precipitating needless conflict with either the education community or other state and
local officials. The conference should be another opportunity to build and highlight support for
the President's overall education agenda, and we can help structure the conference agenda so that
it features those issues in which we and the mayors and most in agreement. USCM believes this
approach furthers its objective of promoting mayoral involvement in education, and Mayor
Daley's office believes this would meet the Mayor's particular objective as well.

Time frame: April???

3. Hispanic Dropout Conference

Background: NEC has been working closely with the Hispanic Caucus on the development of a
Hispanic Education Initiative. In this context, a high priority for the Caucus is a White House
Conference on Hispanic Dropouts, in order to focus national attention on the need for steps to
combat the extremely high Hispanic high school dropout rate.             .

While this topic is probably too narrow in scope for a full White House Conference, it is
important to find a way to respond positively to this request. At present, NEC is considering
some Presidential and Administration involvement in a conference to share solutions to the
dropout problem (Hispanic and others). The conference would highlight lessons from
successful efforts to reduce dropout rates and to provide youth with alternatives to traditional
high schools. The conference would also be a vehicle for highlighting the Administration's
College/School Partnerhsip initiative.

Time frame: [check with NEC]



4. White House Conference on Strengthening Public Education

Purpose: To highlight and build support for the Administration's elementary and secondary



    education agenda by featuring successful local and state examples of the practices, policies and
    investments we are promoting to strengthen public education. The point is to show that the
    Administration's approach to strengthening public education -- raising standards, expanding
    choice, investing in quality and strengthening accountability -- is already paying off in
    communities throughout the nation, and, if expanded and sustained can and will lead to improved
    achievement for all students.

    The event: The conference would be organized around 4-5 sessions, each featuring a mix of
    local educators, state and local officials, parents, kids, employers, community groups, etc. The
    topic of each session would reflect a specifc set of education challenges (e.g., Preparing Students
    to Meet Challenging Standards; Providing Families with Choice; Increasing Participation in
    College; Turning Around Failing Schools; Ensuring all Kids Can Read Independently by Grade
    3) and would highlight success stories that reflect Administration priorities and initiatives (e.g.,
    National Tests, Charter Schools, College/School Partnerships; Class Size Reducation, etc.)
