     . STATEMENT ON THE FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION
       REFORM

     The Commission on Immigration Refonn, chaired by the Honorable Shirley Hufstedler, and the
     late Barbara Jordan, issued its final report today. This report, which reiterates many of the
     excellent recommendations contained in the Commission's interim reports, further contributes to
     our country's understanding ofthe role of immigration in the United States. I commend the
     Commission's work and contribution to the national dialogue on immigration policy.

     This Administration remains committed to improving America's immigration system. We have.
     made significant progress during the tenure of the Commission. My Administration has:

          . done more to curtail illegal immigration-- through tougher border control, strengthened
             worksite enforcement and record removals-- than any Administration in decades;

           supported legal immigration refonn that is pro-family, pro-work and pro-naturalization;

           naturalized record numbers of individuals while working to improve the integrity of the
            process;

           preserved America's heritage as a safe haven for refugees fleeing persecution; and

           fought to protect the rights oflegal immigrants who have a temporary need for benefits
            and services.

     I am pleased that so many of our accomplishments are in accord with many of the Commission
     recommendations over the years.

     More can be done. I have said many times that diversity is one of our greatest strengths. To
     benefit from our diversity, we must do more to help immigrant families' ability to participate in
     our national community. [I hope that the Initiative on Race will include this issue as apart of the
     national dialogue during its work this year.]

     One of the Commission's recommendations is to parcel out the Immigration and Naturalization
     Services' duties to other Departments across the Administration. The Commission notes that
     the Administration has taken significant steps to address weaknesses in INS operations that this
     Administration inherited. This progress results from the committed work of many dedicated
     individuals at INS -- the Border Patrol, the people who process applications, the inspectors and
     many others -- during a period of tremendous growth and challenge for the agency. [I have tasked
     a working group led by my Domestic Policy Council to look carefully at the Commission's
     proposal and to evaluate it and other refonn options designed to improve INS' structural ability
     to accomplish its mission.]
                                                                       Automated Records Mallagement System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
          With this report, the Commission completes its work. I want to thank each of its members and
          its staff for their service and contribution on this important issue.
