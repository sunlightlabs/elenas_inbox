TEXT:
Here is a draft of the one-pager; it reflects comments from Chow, Shireman
and Broderick Johnson, though they are seeing this draft at the same time
you are.  It's a pretty good first approximation, but still needs some
work, and should be vetted with Daschle and Gephardt's staff at some point.=========

                ONE DAY FOR AMERICA'S SCHOOLS:                  ONE DAY ONE VOTE


ONE DAY FOR AMERICA'S SCHOOLS. President Clinton will urge Congress--before it
goes home in two short weeks--to help ensure every American student receives a world-class
education. Joined by Vice President Gore and more than 20 Congressional Democrats,
President Clinton will urge the Congress to set aside one of the few remaining days this year to
vote on and pass his education agenda to reduce class size to a national average of 18, modernize
5,000 schools nationwide, and make the needed investments to provide schools and students with
after-school programs, technology, and other tools to bring our schools into the 21 st century.

       Smaller Classes With Well-Prepared Teachers. President Clinton will urge Congress
        to pass the Class Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Act, his proposal to provide $12
        billion over 7 years to help local communities hire 100,000 teachers and reduce class size
        to a national average of 18 in grades 1-3. Studies show that smaller classes help teachers
        provide more personal attention to students and spend less time ondiscipline, and help
        students to learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills.

           Modern Schools for the 21st Century. President Clinton will urge Congress to pass
            his School Modernization initiative, which will provide local communities with $22
            billion in interest-free bonds to help renovate, modernize and build over 5,000 schools
            nationwide to reduce overcrowding, fix leaky roofs, and make schools safer.

           Critical Investments in After-School Programs, Education Technology and Basic
            Education. President Clinton will urge the Congress to fully fund his FY 1999 budget
            request to strengthen public schools by raising standards, increasing accountability,
            expanding public school choice, strengthening teaching and learning and keeping our
            schools safe and drug free.

                   After-School programs for academic enrichment and extra help in a safe,
                   supervised environment. The President's budget would provide after-school
                   opportunities to more than 425,000 [check number) students, with
                   important tutoring, academic enrichment programs, supervised recreation
                   and community service opportunities in safe, drug-free environments.

                   Education Technology. The President has made an unprecedented
                   committment to bringing technology to the classroom and called for
                   technology training for teachers and expanded access for teachers and
                   students to computers in the classroom.

                   Strengthening Public Schools. Overall, the House LaborlHHS
                   appropriations bill is $2 billion below the President's funding request, and
                   fails to make critical investments needed to raise academic standards, help
                   young children learn to read and all students master the basics, keep our

pathways to college. While the Senate bill rejects the extreme cuts made by
the House, it is still X billion below the President's request, and shortchanges
programs that help young children learn to "read, help children become
proficient in English and learn academic subjects, establish innovative
Charter Schools, and keep middle schools safe and drug-free.
