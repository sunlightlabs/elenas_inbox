                        CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY
                       "The Future of Tobacco in U.S. Policy"
                                 March 30,1998

I am here today, not only as the Chief of Staff of this Administration, but as a businessman, as a
North Carolinian, and as a parent, to talk to you about the President's plan to protect our
children from tobacco.

Consider these facts:
o     Smoking kills 430,000 people every year -- it kills more people than AIDS, alcohol, car
      accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and fires combined. Smoking is still by far the largest
      preventable cause of premature death in the United States.
o     Nearly 90% of smokers started smoking before they turned 18.
o     Nearly half of these teen smokers think they will not be smoking five years after starting -- yet
      only one in five actually manages to quit.
o     Every day, 3,000 young people will become regular smokers, and 1,000 will die sooner as a
      result.

At the same time, multi-million dollar marketing campaigns have been designed to get our
children to light their first cigarettes.
       In the past months, new documents have come to light that conclusively prove that tobacco
       companies aimed to sell their deadly products to children as young as 12.
       These documents are a shocking reminder that our children are under siege by a deadly and
       powerful enemy -- and it is up to us to protect our children.

As Chief of Staff, I can tell you that protecting our children from the threat of tobacco is right at
the top of the President's agenda -- and this administration is fully committed to working with
the bipartisan leadership in Congress to achieve this goal.
       This is not a matter of politics --- it is a matter of priorities. Many Members of Congress from
       both parties have shown enormous leadership on this most important issue.
o      Congressman Waxman first and foremost has been in the forefront of this issue for years --
       providing the powerful leadership it took to bring us to the critical point we have reached today.
        It is a certainty that we would not be here if it were not for his determination.
       Congressman Bliley has recently done the American people a great service by getting thousands
       of pages of documents from the tobacco companies posted on the Internet so all the world can
       see how the tobacco companies have gone after our children.
o      Congressman Fazio and Senators Conrad, Harkin, and Chafee, have worked long and hard to
       introduce tobacco legislation that this Administration can support.




                                                  -1-
       bill that will move us significantly closer to enacting comprehensive tobacco legislation.
       Everyone knows the difficulty of putting together legislation that is so large and complex, but
       Senator McCain has done so in a way that has been as open and inclusive as it has been
       efficient and productive.
      Senator McCain will most likely release his bill later today, and we will need to review it in
       detail before making final judgement.
      Based on what we have seen and heard, I will say this today: We expect to see a bill from
       Senator McCain that will lay a strong foundation for further action, but also has room for
       improvement.

The areas that need further work are critically important:
     For example, we do not believe the McCain bill will impose strong enough lookback penalties
      on companies that continue selling tobacco to our children. Reducing youth smoking is our
      bottom line and we must make it the industries' bottom line.
     We also anticipate seeing some gaps in the bill: the McCain bill does not try to
      comprehensively address the question of how best to use tobacco revenues to protect the public
      health and to help our children.
     As for liability, it is not yet clear what Senator McCain will produce. But, our position is clear:
       unless we are imposing tough penalties on the tobacco companies and doing everything in our
      power to reduce youth smoking, this Administration will not consider proposals to give the
      tobacco companies protection from liability. As we have said many times, reasonable limits
      on liability will not be a deal breaker in a bill that meets all of the president's principles, but
      first, we have to get that kind of bill.

Senator McCain's bill does, however contain some notable steps forward:
      We believe the McCain bill will make significant inroads on youth smoking by substantially
      increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes.
      We believe the McCain bill will also give the FDA the full authority it needs to regulate
      tobacco products, including the authority to restrict both the advertising aimed at young people
      and their access to tobacco.
      And the McCain Bill is also expected to contain a strong plan to protect tobacco farmers and
      their communities.
     We look forward to working with Senator McCain and others in the Commerce Committee and
      the full Senate to significantly strengthen this bill and make it an even more effective
      instrument to reduce youth smoking.

As you know, President Clinton has proposed a comprehensive plan that he believes -- and
experience shows -- is the best way to stop young Americans from smoking before they start.
We are pleased that the McCain Bill will likely include many of the elements of the President's plan,
and we will work hard to see that the McCain Bill is improved to meet all of the President's goals:




                                                                    Automated Reecrds Management System
                                                 -2-                        Hex-Dump Conversion
     Raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over 5 years and $1.50 a pack over the next
      ten years, and impose tough penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids;
     Affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;
     Get companies out of the business of marketing and selling tobacco to minors.
     Promote public health research and public health goals; and
     Protect our tobacco farmers and their communities.

The Treasury Department has found that the President's proposal to stop teenage smoking will
save 1 million lives over the next five years.
      Last week, Vice President Gore announced that new estimates show that our proposal would
       have major effects on youth smoking in every state, with reductions ranging from 33% in
       Washington State to 51 % in Kentucky.
      For every dime added to the price of cigarettes over a 5 year period, up to 270,000 fewer
       teenagers will begin smoking and more than 90,000 premature deaths will be avoided.
       Price increases alone are projected to reduce teenage smoking over the next 5 years by 29%.
       Youth access and marketing restrictions in the President's plan are projected to reduce teenage
       smoking by an additional 11 %.
      The combination of the price increase called for in the President's plan plus the tighter
       restrictions on youth access and marketing, will reduce the number of youths smoking by 3
       million between now and 2003 -- and most importantly help us avoid approximately 1 million
       premature deaths.

The Tobacco companies themselves must also be part of the solution.
     As the President has said, advertising aimed at adults is legal, but tobacco companies must
      draw the line at our children.
      Our proposal requires tobacco companies to help establish smoking cessation programs for
      adult smokers, and to launch public education campaigns aimed at children to keep them from
      smoking in the first place.

The heavy human cost of smoking to our families and communities is tragic -- and as a
businessman, I can tell you that the economic cost to our society is extraordinarily high.
      Smoking related illness costs approximately $60 billion every year -- that's more than the
      federal government spends on education, child care, and medical research combined.
      Smoking during pregnancy results in 2,500 fetal deaths every year, and costs $4 billion per
      year -- this amount is close to double what we spend on cancer research each year.
     Smokers die earlier and have to retire sooner -- and this is estimated to cost our economy as
      much as $80 billion every year in lost output, lost productivity, and lost wages.

These costs rob our economy and cheat the American people out of their hard-earned tax dollars.
 But if we pass the President's plan, we will take the first important steps to reducing these costs,
increasing productivity, and most importantly, saving lives.




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                 -3-                         Hex-Dump Conversion




              We know that this plan will be good for America -- and as a North Carolinian -- born and raised
              in tobacco country -- I can tell you that we must also make sure that we treat our tobacco
              farmers fairly.
                      The President has made protecting tobacco farmers and their communities one of the five
                      key elements for his plan for comprehensive tobacco legislation ..
                      We can achieve the twin goals of both protecting the health of the public and protecting
                      the well-being of farming communities. Recently, a remarkable coalition of farming
                      groups, including burley and flue-cured growers, and public health groups, including the
                      American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society, came together around a
                      shared set of principles. That is a consensus we can build on.
                    .We propose to use some of the revenue from raising the price of cigarettes to make sure
                      that we save our kids without devastating our farm communities. That is a commitment
                      this Administration has made, and we are optimistic that a consensus is forming in
                      Congress to use some of this money to help tobacco farmers.

              President Clinton has submitted to Congress the first balanced budget in 30 years. This budget
              protects our children from the harms of tobacco -- and our nation from the burdensome costs
              associated with teen smoking. This budget also uses the very money raised by raising the price
              of cigarettes to invest in the future of our nation. Our budget uses the tobacco money for:
                     Critical investments in health research, including biomedical research, cancer clinical trials, and
                     children's health outreach -- increasing by nearly 50% the funding for the National Institutes of
                     Health.
                    We also make historic investments in child care and after-school care -- doubling the number
                     of working families who receive child care, and significantly increasing the number of
                     students receiving after school care; and lastly,
                     We make unprecedented investments in education -- reducing class size, hiring 100,000
                     additional teachers, and building or rehabilitating 5,000 schools;

              Finally, and most importantly, as a parent of three kids, I can tell you that when I hear the
              statistics I mentioned earlier, my blood runs cold.
          I          When I saw the documents that showed thatJobacco companies had deliberately tried to get our
                       children to smoke -- despite the fact that a full third of the 3,000 kids who start smoking every
                       day will die prematurely -- I knew then and there that we must not rest until we have done
                      everything we can to protect our children from tobacco.

              We have it within our power right now to save the lives of 1 million kids over the next five years.
                We must not miss this historic opportunity.
                   As President Clinton recently said: "We stand on the verge of one of the greatest public health
                    achievements in history -- an historic triumph in our fight to protect America's children from
                    the deadly threat of tobacco."
                    As Chief of Staff of this Administration, as a businessman, as a North Carolinian, as a parent,
                    and as an American -- I ask you to support our efforts, and to work with us in a bipartisan
                    manner to meet this vitally important challenge.


              Thank you.
                                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                                          Hex텱ump Conversion
                                                                -4-
