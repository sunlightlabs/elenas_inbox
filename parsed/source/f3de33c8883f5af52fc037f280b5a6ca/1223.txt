          The Federal Government's Plan To Hire and Retain Welfare Recipients

The President's directive asks every agency and department in the Federal government to use all
available hiring authorities to hire people off the welfare rolls into available jobs in the
Government. To accomplish this, the President directs each federal agency to present to him in
30 days a plan for hiring and retaining welfare recipients in Federal government positions.

Following is an explanation of how the President would like each agency to prepare the plan to
carry out this directive.

A.     Each agency should survey and report on its hiring capacity under all hiring authorities
This report should include where the agency can hire welfare recipients and in what sort of jobs.

While we encourage agencies to pursue all hiring options -- excepted hiring authorities as
well as the normal competitive hiring process -- the excepted hiring authorities,
particularly the Worker-Trainee program, are the most viable avenues through which to
hire welfare recipients.

The five existing excepted service programs are each targeted to a specific group and boast
simplified hiring procedures: the Veteran's Readjustment Appointment Program; the
Severely Handicapped Appointment Program; the Presidential Management Intern
Program; the Student Career Experience Program; and the Worker-Trainee Program.

The Worker-Trainee program was designed to attract entry-level people into the Federal
workforce. It is a quick and easy way to hire individuals into trainee-type positions where
needed training in basic skills and developmental experiences are offered. Provisions of the
program include the following:

      May hire individuals at grades GS-l, WG-I, WG-2, or the equivalent
      May promote to grades GS-3, WG-4, or the equivalent
      Initial appointment is a term like appointment
      Aftcr three years, may convert to carcer status

B.     Each agency should submit a plan describing in detail how the agency would work
through the Federal Executive Boards (FEBs) and the Federal Executive Associations (FEAs)
around the country to reach out to welfare offices, employment offices, nonprofit organizations,
and others that work with the welfare population on a regular basis to notify them of job
opportunities within the Federal government. [FEBs and FEAs are regional and state boards
made up of the Federal agencies with offices on the particular areas.]

C.     Each agency should submit a plan describing in detail how the agency would prepare and
mentor welfare recipients who are hired by the Federal government to ensure that once hired, the
welfare recipient retains her job. Agencies will work with the Vice President's office and the
National Performance Review to review existing best practices including models such as
Marriot's in-house program to train and hire welfare recipients and the New York-based America
Works job placement and support organization that offers job readiness and training before
placing the welfare recipients in jobs.

D.     Finally, each agency should submit the manner in which the agency will report on a
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

monthly basis its progress in implementing the above plans and consequent hiring.
