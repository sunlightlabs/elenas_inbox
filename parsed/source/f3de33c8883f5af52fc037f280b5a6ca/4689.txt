         WELFARE CASELOADS HAVE DECLINED MORE THAN 3 Yz MILLION
                       UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON
                             October 7, 1997



        President Clinton announced today that welfare caseloads have declined another quarter
of a million, bringing the total reduction to more than 3 Yz million and more than 25 percent since
he became President. Since he signed welfare reform into law last August, welfare rolls have
declined by 1.7 million or 14 percent to just under 10.5 million. For the first time since 1969,
less than 4 percent of the U.S. population is on welfare. A total of 49 out of 50 states have
lowered their welfare rolls -- 13 states by 40 percent or more.

       Later today, Vice President Gore will announce that the federal govemment has made
tremendous progress in fulfilling its commitment to hire 10,000 welfare recipients by the year
2000, doing its fair share to lower the welfare rolls.

        The new caseload numbers underscore the success of the welfare reform law as it begins
its second year. This 3 Yz million caseload decline is the largest in history. Today, welfare
caseloads, which fell by a record 1.9 million in the President's first three-and-a-half years in
office, are on course to have dropped by 2 million more in the one year after signing the law.
The numbers released today, from June 1997, reflect 10 months of the first year of welfare
reform.

         President Clinton has made welfare reform a top priority of his Administration. During
his first four years in office, the President granted federal waivers to 43 States to require work,
time-limit assistance, make work pay, improve child support enforcement, and encourage parental
responsibility.     In August 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility
and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), a comprehensive bipartisan welfare
reform bill that establishes the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.
Since signing the bill into law, the President has focused on efforts to create jobs to move people
from welfare to work, which include fighting for and winning an additional $3 billion for welfare
to work in the Balanced Budget Act, mobilizing the business community to hire welfare
recipients, working with civic, religious and non-profit groups to mentor families leaving welfare
for work, and hiring our fair share of welfare recipients in the federal government.

                              Questions and Answers on Welfare


Caseload Numbers
Question:   Why does the Administration say that welfare reform has already been a
            success?

Answer:        One year after signing the welfare law, caseloads have declined by over 3.6
               million, or 26 percent since the President took office. 10.5 million people were
               on the rolls in June 1997, down from 14.1 million in January 1993, a drop of3.6
               million or 26 percent. This is the largest caseload decline in history: in no other
               comparable time period have as many people come off the rolls. The 10.5
               million people on the rolls represent less than 4 percent of the popUlation -- the
               smallest percentage ofthe population on welfare since 1970.

* Data released today.

              The bipartisan welfare plan that the President signed last year is dramatically
              changing the nation's welfare system into one that requires work in exchange for
              time-limited assistance. The law contains strong work requirements, a
              performance bonus to reward states for moving welfare recipients into jobs, state
              maintenance of effort requirements, comprehensive child support enforcement,
              and supports for families moving from welfare to work -- including increased

                               .                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
            funding for child care and guaranteed medical coverage. State strategies are
            making a real difference in the success of welfare reform, specifically in job
            placement, child care and transportation.

            Even before the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act became law,
            many states were well on their way to changing their welfare programs to jobs
            programs. By granting Federal waivers, the Clinton Administration allowed 43
            states -- more than all previous Administrations combined -- to require work,
            time-limit assistance, make work pay, improve child support enforcement, and
            encourage parental responsibility. The vast majority of states have chosen to
            continue or build on their welfare demonstration projects approved by the Clinton
            Administration.

Question:   The President often uses the decline in welfare caseloads as a measure of
            the success of welfare reform. Isn't the decline due mainly to the good
            economy?

Answer:     Welfare caseloads are the best measure we have right now of the success of
            welfare reform. According to a May report by the Council of Economic Advisors
            (CEA) over 40 percent of the reduction in the welfare rolls can be attributed to the
            strong economic growth during the Clinton Administration, nearly one-third can
            be attributed to waivers granted to states to test innovative strategies to move
            people from welfare to work, and the rest is attributed to other factors -- such as
            the Clinton Administration's decisions to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit,
            strengthen child support enforcement, and increase funding for child care.

Question:   Which are the 13 states that have cut their rolls by over 40% in the last 4
            years?

Answer:     The 13 states are: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Mississippi, North
            Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin, and
            Wyoming. (See attached state-by-state table.)

Question:   Only one of the 50 states has had an increase in its welfare caseloads -
            Hawaii, which has experienced a 36% increase. Why?

Answer:     This is a complex question to answer because of conditions unique to Hawaii,
            including the local economy and different population and demographic trends.
            Hawaii is a state where economic recovery from a recession lags behind the nation
            as a whole. It is also unique in that it is geographically remote from the rest of
            the country, making its economy more contained. Eligibility changes in Hawaii
            since 1995 have brought additional families into the system, but state officials
            report that they have simultaneously increased their emphasis on work for those

             who are on the welfare rolls. Finally, Hawaii reports that they had an influx of
             welfare recipients from other U.S. Pacific territories -- Guam and the Mariana
             Islands -- in 1994.                                                          .

General Welfare Questions
Question:   The President said that the balanced budget he signed into law f"Ixed what he
            promised to fix when he signed the welfare reform law last August. What
            did he mean?

Answer:      When the President signed welfare reform into law last August, he said he thought
             the cuts in programs for legal immigrants and nutritional assistance -- cuts which
             "have nothing to do with the fundamental purposes of welfare reform" -- were
             "too deep" and he pledged to fix them. The new budget does that, by restoring
             $11.5 billion in health and disability benefits for legal immigrants who were in the
             U.S. as oflast August and are receiving benefits or become disabled in the future.
             The new budget restores $1.5 billion in food stamps cuts, providing 235,000 work
             slots for able-bodied childless recipients who must work under the new law. The
             budget also ensures that 30,000 children losing SSI because of the stricter new
             eligibility rules will keep thei~ Medicaid coverage.

$3 Billion Welfare to Work Fund
Question:     What is the $3 billion Welfare to Work Fund?

Answer:      The balanced budget signed into law this summer includes the President's
             proposal for a $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge fund. First proposed
             by the President shortly after he signed the welfare law, this fund will help states
             and local communities move long-tenn welfare recipients into lasting,
             unsubsidized jobs. These funds can be used for job creation, job placement, and
             job retention efforts, including wage subsidies to private employers and other
             critical post-employment support services. The Department of Labor will
             provide oversight, but most of the dollars will be placed, through the Private
             Industry Councils, in the hands of the localities who are on the front lines of the
             welfare refonn effort. In addition, 25 percent of the funds will be awarded by the
             Department of Labor on a competitive basis to support innovative welfare to work
             projects.

             In addition, the new budget also includes a welfare-to-work tax credit for
             employers. This tax credit will give employers an added incentive to hire
             long-tenn welfare recipients by providing a credit equal to 35% of the first
             $10,000 in wages in the first year of employment, and 50% of the first $10,000 in
             wages in the second year, paid to new hires who have received welfare for an
             extended period. The credit is for two years per worker to encourage not only
             hiring, but also retention.

Fair Labor Standards Act and Worker Protections
Question:    Why is the Administration undermining welfare reform by insisting that
             participants·in workfare programs get the protections of the Fair Labor
             Standards Act (FLSA) and other employment laws?

Answer:      We believe that worker protection laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act,
             should apply to workfare participants in the same way they apply to other workers.
              If a workfare participant counts as an "employee" under these laws, then she
             should get protection. No one doing real work should be paid a subminimum
             wage.

             And we believe that paying working welfare recipients the minimum wage and
             giving them other worker protections will promote, not undermine, the goals of
             welfare reform, because it will give them the ability to support their families and
             break the cycle of dependency.

             We will work with states to ensure that they can comply with this policy, without
             undue financial burden, while still meeting the welfare law's work requirements.
             Of course, if states place welfare recipients in private jobs, then the minimum
             wage already applies. And we are working to minimize costs associated with the
             application of employment laws to workfare participants in other ways.

Welfare to Work Partnership
Question:   What is the Welfare to Work Partnership?

Answer:      The Partnership is a national, independent, nonpartisan effort of the business
             community launched in May 1997 to help move people on public assistance to
             jobs in the private sector. The Partnership concentrates on energizing the business
             community to hire and retain welfare recipients without displacing existing
             workers. The Partnership provides information, technical assistance and support
             for businesses of all sizes and sectors, from all industries and from all areas of the
             country.

             The Welfare to Work Partnership now includes well over 1,000 businesses. In
             order to join the Welfare to Work Partnership, companies must either have
             hired or must pledge to hire individuals from public assistance without displacing
             current employees.

             The Partnership recently launched a toll-free hotline and web page to help
             companies all across the nation hire people off welfare. Companies can sign up
             with the Partnership and/or get more information by calling the Partnership'S

              (www.welfirretowork.org). Also, the Partnership recently launched a "city to city
              challenge" in St. Louis. Because jobs are created and filled at the community
              level, the Welfare to Work Partnership is pledging to visit 12 high poverty cities
              over the next 6 months to strengthen each city's welfare to work infrastructure. In
              every city, the Partnership will recruit businesses to hire and retain welfare
              recipients and give them the technical assistance to do so. They will help city
              service providers improve the way they operate so they can provide businesses
              with work-ready welfare recipients. Finally, the Partnership will work with
              elected and appointed state and local officials to celebrate the city's efforts and
              ensure long-term changes. Possible cities include: Indianapolis, Baltimore,
              Columbus or Cleveland, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Seattle, New York City,
              Detroit, San Antonio, Philadelphia, Denver, and Atlanta.

White House Hiring
Question:   In April, the White House pledged to hire six welfare recipients.
            Have any been hired?

Answer:       Yes. The Executive Office of the President has already hired six welfare
              recipients. [Note that the original commitment that the "White House" would hire
              six people actually reflected the full Executive Office ofthe President, including
              OMB and the Office of Administration. To date, the White House has hired 3
              people, OMB has hired 2, and the Office of Administration has hired 1.]

Work Participation Rates
Question:      Why are so many states not meeting the work rates? Does that mean welfare
               reform is a failure?

Answer:       It's important to keep in perspective that 93 percent of the welfare case/oad is
              made up of single parent families and nearly all states expect to meet the work
              rates for those families. The law requires 25 percent of the total welfare caseload
              to work and 75 percent of the two parent families to work.· We think these work
              rules are tough but fair and states with serious welfare reform efforts should be
              able to meet them. Mter all, in these families one parent can work while the
              other takes care of the children.

Question:     How many states do you expect to fail the work rates?

Answer:       We are not sure.   States have until mid-November to report data.      Informally,
most
              states have told us they will meet the overall 25 percent work rate, but many have
              reported concerns about meeting the 75 percent two parent rate. As you may
              know, the Associated Press surveyed states and found 19 states expect to fail the

                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

               two parent work rates and seven states do not know. However, because of the
               staggered start dates for state'TANF plans, only two-thirds of states have to report
               data and are subject to financial penalties this fiscal year, and none of these states
               will be reporting more than three months of data (from July 1- September 30th).

Question:      Will the Administration penalize states that fail the work rates?

Answer.        We will impose penalties on states that do not meet work rates. We believe it is
               critical that states place a priority on putting welfare families to work. The law
               does provide states with the opportunity to receive a credit toward the work rates
               for those who leave the welfare rolls and allows them to propose a corrective
               compliance plan in lieu of a penalty. We will evaluate these requests on a case
               by case basis.

Question:      Is the Administration going to weaken the two parent work rate through
               regulations, as The New York Times has reported?

Answer:        The welfare law explicitly says that states shall receive a "pro rata reduction of the
               participation rate due to caseload reductions" and provides a formula for reducing
               the work rates from, for example, 75 to 50 percent, if the state has had a 25
               percent caseload reduction. Thus it is the law, not the regulation, which provides
               the caseload credit.

Child SUDDort ComDuter Systems
        ......     ...
Question:      Haven't a lot of states failed to meet the October 1st deadline for having state-wide
               chiJd support computer systems in place? What is the Adminstration planning to do
               about this?

Answer.        States have had nine years to develop these computer systems, and we don't intend
               to extend the deadline any further. We do, however, believe that the current law
               -- which requires us to withhold all federal child support funds -- will undermine
               efforts to collect child support for need families. Thus, while we proceed with
               the penalty process, we intend to accept the invitation from members of Congress .
               such as Chairman Shaw to try to work together to devise an additional penalty
               structure. [Note: 17 states and the District of Columbia will not meet the
               deadline.]

Child Support Enforcement -- National New Hire Directory
Question:   What is the National Directory of New Hires?

Answer:        The National Directory of New Hires is part of the welfare)aw's new tools to

                                                 -6-
                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
                collect child support from deadbeat parents. The best way to collect child
                support is to take it right out of parents' paychecks, a process called "wage
                withholding." Before now, it was easy for the 30 percent of parents who live in a
                different state from their children to avoid wage withholding because the state
                where their children live didn't know where they worked. The National
                Directory of New Hires, which will go on-line October 1st, will change all that.
                The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the new hire
                directory will increase child support collections by $6.4 billion over the next ten
                years.

    Question:   Do you have any concerns about privacy issues raised by such a database?

    Answer:     I believe it is critically important we do everything we can to ensure that parents
                pay the child support they owe. Federal law requires the Department of Health
                and Human Services to establish safeguards to protect privacy and ensure the data
                are used only by authorized persons for authorized uses. These issues were
                reviewed in great detail as the child support legislation was considered in the last
                Congress, and there was strong bipartisan support for the establishment of the new
                hire directory and other new child support enforcement measures.
