             WELFARE REFORM: FOOD STAMP WORK REQUIREMENT

Question:     The new welfare law cuts off food stamps for non-disabled adults who
              refuse to work after three months of benefits, and allows the Department
              of Agriculture to exempt areas with high unemployment. Why does the
              Administration want to give food stamp benefits to men and women who
              refuse to work?

Answer:       Enacting the welfare law was an historic accomplishment that represents
              a significant step forward in social policy for this country. However, as I
              said when I signed this bill, several provisions of the law have nothing to
              do with the goal of welfare reform -- putting people to work. Instead, they
              cut back on our vital food safety net and are unfair to immigrants who
              have entered this country legally.

              I strongly support work requirements. But the welfare law's harsh and
              unreasonable time limit of3 months in 36 cuts off people who want to work but
              can't find jobs. In my budget, I proposed an alternative: a real and tough work
              requirement without arbitrary cut-offs.

              Under my proposal, those who refused to work or refused to take advantage of a
              work opportunity would face tough new penalties. We would limit food stamps to
              6 months out of 12. This policy would encourage work while giving those out of
              work the transitory help they need to get back on their feet. We proposed new
              funding and a wage supplementation option to expand the number of work slots
              available to this group by nearly 400,000 over five years. I am looking forward
              to working with Congress to enact this sensible proposal.

Background:
    As of March 1, states will begin to cut off food stamp benefits for people who have not
     met the new work requirement in the welfare law.

      Under the law, able-bodied childless adults between the ages of 18-50 are not permitted
       to get food stamps for more than 3 months in a 3-year period, unless they are working at
       least 20 hours a week.

      USDA can waive the work requirement in cities or counties with high unemployment.
       To date, USDA has granted waivers to 23 states that exempt specified counties or cities
       with high unemployment.

      Despite these exemptions, 600,000 individuals will lose their food stamp
       eligibility in FY98 due to this provision. Under the Administration's proposal,
       approximately 35,000 individuals would lose eligibility in FY98. Unlike the
       welfare law, the Administration's proposal targets tough sanctions at those
       individuals who are unwilling to work and to play by the rules.

            WELFARE REFORM:            BENEFITS TO LEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Question:   Immigrants shouldn't be coming to the U.S. to get on welfare. Why is the
            Administration making restoration of these benefits a priority?

Answer:     I believe that legal immigrants should have the same opportunity, and
            bear the same responsibility, as other members of our society. The
            welfare law denies most legal immigrants access to fundamental safety
            net programs unless they become citizens -- even though they are in the
            U.S. legally, are working and paying taxes and are responsible members
            of our communities. My Administration has always supported making
            individuals who encourage their relatives to emigrate to the United States
            responsible for the immigrant's well being. However, as a nation, we
            should not turn our backs on anyone who has lost their ability to earn a
            living due to injury, disease, or illness.

            Consequently, my budget proposes to make legal immigrants who
            become disabled after entering the United States eligible for SSI and
            Medicaid.

            My budget would also provide poor immigrant children the same Medicaid
            health care coverage low-income citizen children receive.

            The United States admits refugees and asylees into this country on a
            humanitarian basis. My budget proposes to lengthen the five-year
            exemption for refugees from the ban from five to seven years in order to
            give this group adequate time to naturalize.

            Finally, the law denies food stamps to most legal immigrants. My budget
            would delay the cutoffs from April 1, 1997 to August, 1997 in order to give
            immigrants more time to naturalize.


              WELFARE REFORM FIX LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

Question:   You say you are ready to work with Congress to fix the immigrant and food stamp
            parts of the welfare law, but the Republican leadership says the bill is fine as it is.
            Even some Democrats are saying the law shouldn't be changed until we have had
            a chance to see how it works. Doesn't this mean your proposals have no chance
            of being enacted?

Answer:     I think it is very significant that the nation's Governors are now on record as
            recognizing that the cuts in benefits to legal immigrants are too harsh and need to
            be addressed -- even though their final resolution was softened at the last minute
            at the request of the Congressional leadership.
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

            As the new welfare law is being implemented, the Governors are gaining a new
            appreciation of some parts of the bill that I have had a problem with from the
            beginning -- those parts that are not related to putting people to work. This is
            particularly true of those Governors in states with large numbers of legal
            immigrants. They are now looking more carefully at their state budgets and the
            fact that many legal immigrants who are disabled, many in nursing homes, will
            lose their SSI and Medicaid over the summer. In addition to noting that these
            provisions are unfair, they can see the potential costs to their own state budgets if
            they make the decision to ameliorate those cuts.

            I think that, over time, more and more people will come to see the harm that these
            provisions could do to hard-working people who came to this country and,
            through no fault of their own, became disabled and could no longer support their
            families.

            Also, I truly believe we are seeing some real changes in our relationship with the
            Congress. It appears that we have gotten past some of the unproductive ways of
            doing business we have had over the past two years, and that we are learning how
            to work with one another in a far more constructive fashion.


Question:   Last summer when you said you would sign the welfare bill there were press
            reports that you wanted to restore about $14 billion in cuts. Now we understand
            your budget includes $18 billion in legislative restorations. Are you proposing to
            restore more in food stamps and benefits to immigrants that you were last year?

Answer:     No, absolutely not. The budget includes $18 billion in legislative proposals for
            Food Stamps and immigrants that correspond directly to the commitments I made
            at the time I signed the bill. Because of a number of technical reestimates, the
            budget estimate for these legislative proposals is now higher.

            The commitment I made to a $3 billion program to help the private sector, states,
            and cities move welfare recipients to work was always separate from that total,
            and was paid for separately elsewhere in my budget.
