                                             March 20, 1997


TODAY, THE PRESIDENT WILL SEND TO CONGRESS NEW LEGISLATION TO HELP
OPEN THE DOORS OF COLLEGE TO MORE AMERICANS. The Hope and Opportunity for
Postsecondary Education (HOPE) Act of 1997 -- part of President Clinton's five-year balanced budget--
includes a $10,000 tuition tax deduction, a $1,500 Hope Scholarship tax credit, a substantial PeIl Grant
expansion and increase, a cut in student loan fees, new educational assistance from employers, and other
provisions. The new legislation provides:

"      $38.4 billion over five years in tax relief for middle-income families struggling to pay for coIlege
       and make ends meet.
"      At least $40 billion in Pell Grants over five years to provide more tuition assistance to low- and
       moderate-income families, the largest increase in two decades.
"      $2.6 billion in savings over five years in reduced loan fees for student loan borrowers -- putting
       more money into the hands of students when they pay tuition biIls and other coIlege expenses.
"      Financial support for worker training through the tuition deduction and the extension of the

                       Summary of the Hope and Opportunity
                  for Postsecondary Education (HOPE) Act of 1997
                                                      March 20, 1997


Today's employers look for job applicants with more than a high school diploma. Since the success of the
post-World War II GI Bill, the Federal Government has expanded college aid, making it possible for more
Americans to attend college. But for too many, the financial strains of continuing their education are still
severe. The President's Hope and Opportunity for Postsecondary Education (HOPE) Act of 1997 ensures that
these barriers to higher education continue to fall for all Americans and provides tax relief for middle-income
families struggling to pay for college.


                         Title I: HIGHER EDUCATION TAX INCENTIVES

HOPE Scholarship Tax Credits

       Up to a $1,500 per student credit for tuition and fees for course work beginning on or after July I,
        1997.

       Credit can be claimed in two tax years for any student who has not finished 13th and 14th years of
        education.

       The tax credit is expected to help 4.2 million students (1998), and would save families $18.6 billion
        over five years.

The non-refundable tax credit is available for students enrolled on at least a half-time basis during the first two
years of postsecondary education. The credit may be claimed in no more than two years. To receive the
credit for the second time, the student must have at least a B minus grade point average in course work
completed before that year. Federal grants (but not loans or work-study) generally would reduce the
allowable tax credit. No credit would be available for any student convicted of a drug-related felony.

The credit would be phased out for taxpayers filing a joint return with adjusted gross income between $80,000
and $100,000. For taxpayers filing single and head-of-household returns, the credit would be phased out for
adjusted gross income between $50,000 and 70,000. (The phase-out ranges and the amount of the credit
would be indexed).

Tax Deduction/or Higher Education and Training

       $10,000 per family maximum deduction for lifelong learning ($5,000 maximum in 1997 and 1998).

       Available for job training and re-training, in addition to traditional undergraduate and graduate
        education.

       Deduction is "above the line" -- available even if the taxpayer does not itemize.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
        Expected to help 8.1 million students (1998), and would save families $17.5 billion over five years.
The deduction could be claimed for out-of-pocket tuition and fees paid for any student enrolled at least
half-time in a degree or certificate program, including graduate programs, at an eligible postsecondary
institution. In addition, the deduction would be available for the cost of training -- whether or not it leads to
a degree -- that helps the student, older worker, or job-seeker improve or acquire job skills. A student in the
first two years of postsecondary education could choose either the credit or the deduction, but not both. The
deduction phases in, beginning with a $5,000 maximum per family for payments made after December 31,
1996 to cover course work beginning on or after July 1, 1997. It increases to a $10,000 maximum deduction
                     .
beginning in 1999. The deduction would be phased out at the same income levels as the credit.

Tax-free Education Savings*

      Families with incomes up to $100,000 would be eligible for IRAs, and could make penalty-free
       withdrawals for higher education.

      Combined with tuition deduction (above), the IRA savings spent by middle-income families on tuition
       and fees would never be taxed.

* As part of his balanced budget plan, the President has proposed a number of changes to IRAs to make it
possible for families to use them to pay for education tax-free. Although the specific legislation providing for
these changes is not included in the HOPE Act, it will be transmitted to Congress soon.

The President's budget plan would allow IRAs to be used for postsecondary education expenses free from
early withdrawal tax penalties, and would make over 20 million families eligible to make tax-deductible IRA
contributions. Currently, if an individual (or spouse) already participates in an employer's retirement plan,
eligibility is phased out for taxpayers filing a joint return with adjusted gross income between $40,000 and
$50,000 (between $25,000 and $35,000 for single filers). The proposal would expand the phase-out ranges
for 1997 through 1999 to $70,000 to $90,000 for joint filers ($45,000 to $65,000 for single). Beginning in
2000, the phase-out range would match the ranges described for the higher education tax credit. The proposal
would also create a special IRA that could be used to save for education and other needs, subject to the same
income limits.

Educational Assistance from Employers

      Extends tax exclusion for employer-provided education assistance (Section 127) through the year
       2000, for both undergraduate and graduate education.

      Tax credit to encourage small businesses to offer educational assistance to employees.

      Benefits 1.7 million employees a year.

The current exclusion from an employee's income of up to $5,250 per year of postsecondary educational
assistance provided by an employer expires this year, and expired for graduate-level assistance last year. The
President would extend the exclusion, and reinstate the graduate-level component, through the year 2000. In
addition, for 19?8-2000, small businesses would be given a new incentive to provide educational assistance to
their employees through a ten-percent tax credit for amounts paid under an employer-provided educational
assistance program for education provided by a third party.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


Community Service: Loan Forgiveness

       Tax-free loan cancellation for public service and forgiveness under the income contingent repayment
        plan.

 Under current law, a charity or private educational institution that forgives a loan as part of a program that
 enables graduates working in certain professions (such as rural medicine or teaching) to pay off their student
 loans through community service must report the loan forgiveness as income to the graduate. This proposal
 would exclude the loan forgiveness from an individual's income and clarify that the same treatment would be
톚rovided for forgiveness under the income contingent loan repayment plan for direct loans.


                      Title II: FINANCIAL AID FOR NEEDY STUDENTS

Pell Grant Increase and Expansion

       Largest increase in Pell Grants in two decades.

       $300 boost in the Pell Grant maximum, to a $3,000 maximum award. Since FY 1996, the maximum
        award will have increased $530.

       A 25 percent funding increase over last year -- $1.7 billion more than the FY 1997 appropriation.

       3.6 million students now receiving Pell Grants will be eligible to receive an increase of up to $300.
        The increase will make 130,000 more moderate-income families eligible for the grant.

       Older student provision will make Pell Grants available to additional 218,000 low-income students
        generally aged 24 or over.

       With these changes, the number of Pell Grant recipients will exceed 4 million in FY 1998.

       At least $40 billion available for Pell Grants for needy students over five years.

Pell Grants are the foundation of student aid for low- and moderate-income families. Increasing the
maximum award to $3,000 provides more aid to currently eligible students, and makes an additional 130,000
students eligible for the grants. In addition, the proposal would increase the eligibility of older, low-income
students. With this change, more low-income students who are 24 years old or older and financially
independent from parents would receive a Pell Grant. Pell Grants are particularly beneficial for low-income
students who have little or no tax liability because of the high award level and its availability for all four years
of undergraduate education.

Cut Student Loan Fees and Interest

       Borrower-paid loan fees cut in half for 4 million low- and middle-income students, and by a quarter for
        2.5 million other loans to student and parent borrowers.

       $2.6 billion in borrower savings over five years produced by the fee cut alone.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

      Interest rate during in-school period cut for 2 million students, saving them an additional $1 billion.

Before 1993, borrowers lost up to 8 percent of their student loans in required fees before the money ever
reached them. In 1993, the President's aggressive student loan reforms spurred a 50 percent cut in allowable
fees that has already saved families nearly $2 billion. The President's plan proposes -- for both the Direct and
guaranteed loan programs -- to cut loan fees from 4 percent to just 2 percent on need-based Stafford loans, and
to 3 percent on other loans for students and parents.

The Congressional Budget Office and other analysts have noted that lender costs during the in-school period --
when students are not required to make payments on their loans -- are very low. The budget reduces the
interest rate during that period by one percentage point.

The proposal provides these benefits to students while saving taxpayers $3.5 billion over five years by
streamlining the guaranty agency system to make it more efficient and cost effective and by eliminating excess
lender profits.

College Work-Study*

      Budget funds 1 million College Work-Study slots by the year 2000.

      Incentives to reach the goal of 100,000 work-study reading tutors by 1999.

The President's 1998 budget also increases aid for students through subsidized jobs in the College Work-Study
program. The President has called on colleges to commit half of the increased funding since FY 1996, $120
million for FY 1998, to supporting community service jobs. The Secretary of Education recently waived the
institution's required portion of the awards for students that participate as reading tutors -- part of America's
Reading Challenge, helping to ensure that every child can read independently and well by the end of third
grade. The President's budget is on a path to achieve the President's goal to raise the number of Work-Study
recipients to a million by the year 2000, and 100,000 reading tutors by 1999.

* College Work-Study proposal is included in the President's budget request and appropriations language but
not in the HOPE Act.

                          How the President's Higher Education Proposals
                                Benefit Typical American Families


                            Two Examples of How to Save for College Tax-Free

Taken together, the Administration's proposal to allow penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for college tuition
and the nlition tax deduction allow families to save tax-free for their children's education. Families pay no
income taxes on money they contribute to an IRA, and the interest accumulates tax-free. Under the
Administration's proposal, families would be allowed to withdraw money from their IRA to pay higher
education expenses without paying the usual excise tax. And because they can deduct tuition expenses of up
to $10,000 per year from taxable income, they will not have to pay the income tax normally due on IRA
withdrawals. This adds up to tax-free saving for college.

The following examples demonstrate how the Administration's proposals help families save for their children's
college tuition:


                                                   Example 1
                                             $35,000 Family Income

A family with combined income of $35,000 per year in a 15 marginal tax bracket saving for college expenses
of $10,000 per year for 4 years. The family earns an 8 annual return.

          Under the Administration's proposal this family would need to put $955 per year in before tax
           savings into an IRA for 18 years.

           Without the Administration's proposal, the same family would need to put away almost $1,090 per
           year after taxes. That means that they need to earn more than $1,280 per year before taxes, a
           difference of $325 per year to reach the same savings goal.


                                                   Example 2
                                             $60,000 Family Income

A family with combined income of $60,000 per year in a 28 marginal tax bracket saving for college expenses
of $10,000 per year for 4 years. The family earns an 8 annual return.

           Under the Administration's proposal this family would need to put $955 per year in before-tax
           savings into an IRA for 18 years.

           Without the Administration's proposal, the same family would need to put away $1,220 per year
           after taxes. That means that they need to earn nearly $1,700 per year before taxes, a difference of
           almost $750 per year to reach the same savings goal.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
                           Four Examples of How the HOPE Act Works

The tax liabilities used in the following four examples are based on the personal exemption, standard
deduction and the beginning point for the 28 percent rate bracket assumed to be in effect in 1998, the first
year the increased Pell Grants will be available under the President's proposal. Under the proposal, the
maximum tuition deduction for 1998 is $5,000. It is $10,000 for years thereafter. Tax liabilities are
estimated on the assumption that itemized deductions of 18 percent of adjusted gross income are claimed
if that amount exceeds the standard deduction.


                                            Example 3
                                      $60,000 Family Income
                             Married Couple With One Child in College
                                       1998 Benefit: $1,500

Larry and Jill O'Neill are a married couple with two children. Larry and Jill earn $60;000 in 1998. They
claim both children as dependents because they provide more than half of their support. Bobby, the
O'Neills' older child, enrolls as a freshman in a community college in the fall of 1998 and is charged
$1,500 in tuition and required fees. Bobby's parents pay his tuition. Under the President's proposals, the
O'Neill are entitled to a HOPE Scholarship tuition credit of $1 ,500. (Because a credit is being claimed for
Bobby's freshman year, his grade point average does not affect his eligibility for the credit.) The credit
reduces their tax liability by $1,500. Thus, the O'Neills get a total benefit of $1,500 from the
President's proposals.

Joe Jefferson is a college freshman in the fall of 1998. He is single and supports himself. He earns
$10,000 in 1998. In September 1998, Joe enrolls in college and pays $3,025 in tuition and required
fees for the fall semester. In December he is charged $3,025 in tuition and fees for the spring
semester. Under the President's proposals, Joe is entitled to a Pell grant of$3,000 that he uses to pay
part of his tuition. He pays the remaining $3,050 with a combination of savings and loans. Under
the President's proposals, he is entitled to a tuition deduction for his $3,050 payment. The deduction
reduces Joe's tax bill by $458, which is more than his total tax liability for the year. Thus, Joe gets a
total benefit of $3,458 from the President's proposals, $3000 in Pell Grants and $458 in reduced
taxes.

Victor and Susan Montoya are a married couple with one child, Maria. Tom and Susan earn $30,000
in 1998. They claim Maria as a dependent because they provide more than half of her support.
Maria attends college for two semesters in 1998 and is charged $6,850 in tuition and required fees at
the beginning of the year. Under the President's proposals, Maria receives a Pell grant for $1,850.
Her parents pay $1,000 of her tuition. She pays the rest of the tuition bill with a combination of
savings and loans. Under the President's proposals, the Montoyas are entitled to a tuition deduction
for the $5,000 their family has paid in tuition and required fees. The deduction reduces the Montoyas'
tax bill by $750. Thus, the Montoyas get a total benefit of $1,050 from the President's proposals,
$300 in additional Pell Grants and $750 in reduced taxes.

                                     1998 Benefit: $1,450

Paul and Debbie Green are a married couple with two children, David and Barbara. Paul and Debbie
have income of $90,000 in 1998 (including income from an IRA withdrawal, described below). They
claim David and Barbara as dependents because they provide more than half of their support. In
1998, David is enrolled in college for the second semester of his junior year and the first semester of
his senior year. Barbara is enrolled in the second semester of her freshman year and the first semester
of her sophomore year. At the beginning of 1998, Barbara has a B+ grade point average. David's
bill for tuition and required fees is $5,000, and Barbara's is $1,500. Paul and Debbie pay their
children's tuition and required fees with a combination of savings, including $2,000 they withdraw
from their IRAs, and loans. Under the President's proposals, they avoid any penalty for early
withdrawal from their IRAs, and they are entitled to a credit of $750 for Barbara's tuition and a .
deduction of$2,500 for David's tuition. (Because their income places them in the middle of the
$80,000 to $100,000 phase-out range, they claim half the maximum credit and deduction.) The
credit and the deduction reduce their tax liability by $1,450. Thus, the Greens get a total benefit of
$1,450 from the President's proposals.

                              Methodology of State-by-State Analysis

   Pel! Grant Budget Authority for Academic Year 1998-99
   Estimates are based on 1998-99 Pell Grant projections, adjusted by the 1994-95 academic year distribution
   of Pell recipients and funding among different States.

   Combined Tax Benefitsfor Calendar Year 1998
   Using a nationally-representative sample of postsecondary students, we first determined the likelihood of a
   Pell and non-Pell recipient receiving a tax benefit. Using these data and the Pell Grant distributions
   discussed above, we estimated the number of students that would receive a tax benefit in each state. We
   then used this relative distribution of tax beneficiaries to allocate calendar year 1998 benefit amounts ($5.9
   billion) among the States.

   Cuts in Student Loan Origination Fees for Academic Year 1998-99
   Estimates are based on projected loan amounts and number of borrowers for academic year 1998-99, and
   the historical distribution of loans by State. Two percent of Stafford (subsidized) loan volume and one
   percent of unsubsidized loan volume equal the estimated student savings by State.
