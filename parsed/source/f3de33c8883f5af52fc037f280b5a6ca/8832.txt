                   Welfare Reform: Application of FICA to Workfare Jobs


Talking Points

      The President supports exempting workfare payments from FICA taxes, but wants to
       ensure that such action does not weaken worker protections.

      I understand that the IRS is very close to issuing a ruling on this subject. I know this
       ruling is long overdue, but I want you to know that we have been working hard toward
       this goal.

Background

Treasury and the IRS have prepared a draft notice stating that workfare positions are not
subject to FICA taxes (workfare participants are already ineligible for the EITC as a result
of a Balanced Budget Act provision). Governors have long sought this FICA exemption to
help minimize the costs of running publicly-funded work programs for welfare recipients.
However, organized labor is concerned that such a notice will provide support for legal
challenges that worker protections do not apply to workfare. Through Department of
Labor guidance issued in May 1997, the Administration had taken a firm stand that
minimum wage and other labor protections apply to workfare positions.

The Treasury and Labor Departments are in the final stages of crafting language to try to
minimize any effect on worker protections. While the labor unions will not be satisfied
with this outcome, we still expect the Treasury Department to issue the ruling.

A year ago, after the President spoke to the NGA, he discussed this issue with several
governors and told them that he supports exempting workfare payments from FICA taxes.

Summary of Draft Ruling

The draft ruling establishes a three-part test for whether workfare is subject to taxes:

              The only payments the individual receives for the work activity come directly
               from the state or local welfare agency, or its contractor.

              Payment is funded entirely by TANF and/or food stamps.

              Size ofthe payment is limited by welfare laws; and the number of hours is limited
               by the size of the payment divided by the minimum wage.
                                                                    1~lltomated
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

    The ruling is based in part on IRS's 1971 "general welfare" doctrine, which states that
    "disbursements by a government to an individual under a legislatively provided social benefit
    program for the promotion of the general welfare, and that are not made basically for services
    rendered" are not subject to income or employment taxes.

    The ruling states that a TANF payment may be made both for the promotion of the general
    welfare and as compensation for services, and it is not practically feasible to determine the
    relative proportion of each purpose. Therefore, it carves out the 3-part exception above for cases
    where the primary measure of the amount received is the state's welfare grant rather than the
    value of services performed.

    The ruling has disclaimer: "No implication is intended as to ... whether an employment
    relationship exists under any other provision oflaw, including the Fair Labor Standards Act."

    The ruling would be released by IRS as a "notice." The policy would be effective immediately
    (and would in fact apply retroactively). After considering public comments, the IRS would then
    issue a formal regulation.
