                                      Q&A
               The Federal Government Plan to Hire Welfare Recipients

Question:   Hiring XXX welfare recipients over four years seems ambitious. Are these figures
            realistic?

Answer:     This is an ambitious plan and it is a testament to the leadership and creativity of
            this Administration. However, you must remember that these numbers are
            preliminary estimates and may go up or down depending on future budgets as well
            as the success of agency outreach and retention plans, and other factors such as
            the strength of the economy.

Question:   Why have some agencies set specific numerical targets while others have not?

Answer:     The directive asked agency and department heads to each prepare an
            individualized plan for hiring welfare recipients that included a survey of where
            jobs exist within each agency. Some agencies have set target numbers as
            motivating devices. Others have decided that it is too early in this stage of the
            process to set numbers and have, instead, developed extensive outreach and
            recruiting plans.

Question:   What sort of hires are included in the XXX figure?

Answer:     All agencies have surveyed their existing hiring capacity and have reported
            available entry-level positions through all existing hiring capacities including the
            Worker-Trainee program the President encouraged them to use. The XXX number
            refers only to those who would be hired directly by the Federal government.
            Additionally, many of the agencies will be encouraging their grantees and
            contractors to hire welfare recipients, thereby further increasing the number of
            recipients likely to be hired.

Question:   What are the common elements of each plan?

Answer:     While every agency plan is different, most plans address the following elements:
            Agency hiring capacity and available resources; plans for outreach to potential
            employees both within the Federal government and in the private for-profit and
            nonprofit sectors through government contractors and grantees; job preparation
            including formal training, job readiness and education; and plans to retain
            employees once hired including addressing child care and transportation issues, as
            well as using existing Employee Assistance Programs and creating mentoring or
            buddy programs to address personal issues that may arise.
                                                                  Hex.l)ilmp Conv2mtOn

Question:   How are you going to hire welfare recipients at a time government is downsizing
            and budgets are tough?

Answer:     It is true that the government has been downsizing. Since the President took
            office, he has actually reduced the White House workforce by XXX%. Other
            agencies have similalrly reduced their workforces. However, downsizing does not
            mean that there are no jobs to fill. As in any organization, there is a natural
            amount of tum over injobs at all levels. The Federal agencies have surveyed
            current vacancies and have committed to reaching out specifcally to the welfare
            population to fill those positions.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conve:sion

Question:   How many Federal employers are there and what percentage of the workforce
            does that represent?

Answer:     There are 1.9 million Federal employees that account for 1.5% of the nation's
            workforce.

Question:   How much will this effort cost?

Answer:     This effort should not cost anything. All personnel offices conduct recruitment
            and outreach as part of their normal activities and build in these necessary
            activities as part of their normal budgets. Essentially, we are expecting agencies
            to carry this out within their existing budgets.

Question:   Will agencies be hiring only in Washington, D.C.?

Answer:     No. We're talking about jobs all over the country. More than 85 percent of
            federal jobs are located outside the Washington metropolitan area.

Question:   The White House has over 1,500 employees. Why is the White House hiring only
            six recipients?

Answer:     The White House is ready to hire six welfare recipients now. Once the White
            House program is in place and the initial six are hired, we expect to continue to
            hire more over the coming years.

Question:   In which departments will the White House place the first six welfare recipients?

Answer:     One of the first welfare recipients will be placed in the Domestic Policy Council,
            the agency primarily responsible for welfare reform. Others will be placed
            through the Executive Office of the President.

Question:   Aren't you favoring welfare recipients over everyone else?

Answer:     We are not creating any preference such as the one that exists for veterans. We
            are encouraging the departments to use an existing hiring authority that allows
            departments to cut through red tape and hire entry-level workers quickly and
            easily. We are also encouraging outreach efforts. This is the same commitment
            that the President has asked of the private sector.

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

Question:   Why are we specifically helping welfare recipients rather than other poor people?

Answer:     We make no apologies about the fact that we are asking the agencies to hire needy
            single mothers with children. These are the people whom it is most crucial to
            reach and put on the track of work. We want to help these families move from
            dependence on welfare to independence through self-sufficiency.

Question:   Now that the agencies have turned in their plans, what are the next steps?

Answer:     Agencies will begin working right away to fill available jobs by reaching out to
            welfare recipients to notify them of those jobs, and to fully use the existing
            programs to help recipients take and keep the jobs.

Question:   Why did it take the Administration so long to get its hiring program off the
            ground?

Answer:     The Federal hiring process is full of complex rules and regulations. We sat down
            and looked at all of these rules to find the best way through them. We discovered
            an existing track of hiring authority -- The Worker-Trainee Program -- that would
            allow agencies to hire entry-level people quickly and easily, without all the usual
            hurdles. Additionally, we have encouraged the agencies to use other existing
            hiring authorities to tap into this labor pool. We are thrilled that so many of the
            agencies presented us with creative and ambitious plans that show their
            commitment and leadership to the pressing issue of moving welfare recipients
            permanently into the workforce.

Question:   Does the President think federal government hiring is the way to reform welfare?

Answer:     The Federal government's role is an important one but is only part of the formula
            for success. The President would like the Federal government to do what he has
            asked of the private for-profit and nonprofit sectors as well as the faith community
            -- to help meet his challenge to move 2 million people off the welfare rolls by the
            year 2000, and to continue to move recipients into work thereafter. The President
            is extremely pleased that all of his Cabinet Secretaries and other agency and
            department heads responses have been so enthusiastic.

Question:   What can you tell me about the meeting the President is planning with business
            leaders in May?

Answer:     As you know, the President has met several times with key business leaders to
            discuss their role in making welfare reform a success. Most recently, the
            President met with 14 CEOs of major corporations, each of whom pledged to


                                             4
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

            become involved in this effort. Now, this May, the President will again meet
            with many of those initial CEOs as well as 25 additional CEOs to talk about their
            specific commitments to the welfare to work effort.

Question:   Nearly half of the total hiring figures you've cited for all Cabinet agencies come
            from the Department of Commerce, specifically 4,000 hires attributed to the
            coming Census. Don't the Census hires really artificially inflate your numbers?

Answer:     We are extremely pleased that the Department of Commerce has been able to
            commit to so many hires over the next four years. As you point out, many of
            those jobs will be created over the coming year as a result of hiring needs to
            complete the 2000 census. Some of those jobs will be temporary or part-time in
            nature, while others could turn into long term employment. However, as you
            know, every job is significant because whether it is short term or long term, ajob
            offers a welfare recipient valuable work experience and on the job training that
            can help her achieve permanency in the labor market. Further, even without the
            census numbers, the Cabinet Secretaries' numbers are extremely significant and
            only represent a start. Once agency programs are up and running, we will likely
            see the numbers continue to rise.

 Announcement
 Today, President Clinton holds the first full cabinet meeting of his second term to receive
 responses to his March 8, 1997 directive asking all Federal agencies to develop plans to hire
 welfare recipients. All of the Cabinet agencies as well as over 100 non-Cabinet agencies and
 departments have submitted hiring plans to the President through the Office of the Vice
 President. To date, the Cabinet agencies estimate they can directly hire a combined total of
 XXX welfare recipients into the Federal government over a four year period in positions around
 the nation. Further, most agencies will be encouraging their grantees and contractors to hire
 welfare recipients.

 The President is also releasing today new data showing that welfare caseloads have declined by
 2,755,000 or 20 percent during his first term and he is announcing plans to meet in May with a
 large group of corporate CEOs to discuss their specific commitments to make the welfare reform
 effort a success.

 Background
 On March 8, 1997, President Clinton directed each head of a Federal agency or department to use
 all available hiring authorities to hire and retain welfare recipients in jobs in the government. The
 President called for agencies to prepare individualized plans for hiring welfare recipients and
 asked the agencies to explore and report on ways to help low-income employees gain access to
 the Earned-Income Tax Credit (EITC), transportation subsidies, and affordable child care.

 Each head of a Federal agency or department was asked to assess its hiring capacity and to
 develop a hiring and job retention plan suited to that particular agency's workforce, resources,
 and needs. All Cabinet agencies and over 100 non-Cabinet agencies and departments have
 responded.

  Since signing the historic welfare reform law, the President has urged businesses, non-profit
  organizations, and religious groups across the nation to help make its promise of opportunity real
  by offering jobs to welfare recipients. By taking this action, the President ensures that the
  federal government, as the nation's largest employer, does its fair share to move welfare
  recipients to work.
  The Clinton Strategy
  The Federal government hiring effort is only one piece of President Clinton's larger strategy to
. make welfare reform a reality. First, the President is visiting state legislatures to share the
  country's best welfare to work practices and to encourage every state to rise to the challenge he
  has laid out to them. Second, the President has enlisted key members of the business community
  in his effort, soliciting pledges of help from Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, United
  Airlines, and others. Third, he continues to reach out to nonprofits and the faith community,
  similarly urging them to meet his challenge and offering them information and expertise on how
  to do so. Finally, the President has included money in his FY 1998 budget for several welfare to
  work initiatives including tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire people off
  welfare; incentives for job placement firms and states to create more jobs for welfare recipients;
  and training, transportation, and child care to help people go to work.

Federal Government Employees

      There are 1.9 million Federal employees nationwide

      Federal employees represent 1.5% of this country's workforce

      Last year, the federal government hired over 190,000 permanent and temporary workers.

      There are 1,5l3 employees in the Executive Office of the President .. a number including
       all employees of the Office of Management and Budget, the US Trade Representative, the
       National Security Council, the Domestic Policy Council, the National Economic Council,
       and others

Hiring Power In the U.S.

      There are 826,000 U.S. businesses with more than 20 employees

      There are 1.1 million nonprofit organizations (not including congregations).

      There are 135,119 congregations with more than 200 members and 205,583
       congregations with more than 100 members.

The Welfare Rolls

      There are 20 percent fewer people on welfare than the day the President took his first
       oath of office -- the largest decline in the history of the welfare system. The welfare
       caseload fell by 2,755,000 from 14,115,000 in January 1993 to 11,360,000 in January
       1997.

      Before the President signed the welfare reform bill, he worked with states to test reform
       strategies, giving 43 states waivers from federal rules to experiment with reforms that
       required work, imposed time limits, and demanded personal responsibility. In 1993, the
       President made work pay better than welfare for 15 million low income families through
       an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit which he proposed and the Congress
       adopted.
