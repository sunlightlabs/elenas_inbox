Forty percent of our children read below the basic level in the fourth grade, as reported by the 1994 National
Assessment ofEducation'al Progress, Research shows that these children too often fall further behind in school,
lose interest, give up, and drop out. To help these children, President Clinton launched the America Reads
Challenge. In order to empower parents and to encourage all States and schools to reach for the America Reads
goal, the President also proposed voluntary national standards and tests in the fourth grade.

TODAY, PRESIDENT CLINTON WILL ANNOUNCE THAT NEARLY 800 COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES, FROM EVERY STATE, HAVE PLEDGED TO COMMIT WORK-STUDY SLOTS TO
HELP ENSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN CHILD CAN READ WELL AND INDEPENDENTLY. Less
than a year ago, the Secretary of Education issued a regulation allowing the Federal Work-Study Program to pay 100
percent of the wages for students who work as reading tutors for elementary school children, and the President
named a steering committee of 21 college and university presidents who volunteered to start their own programs and
to encourage other colleges to do the same, As of today, 790 colleges and universities have pledged tutors to
America Reads.                                              .

TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRESIDENT CLINTON IS ANOTHER STEP FORWARD IN HIS
EFFORT TO INVOLVE COLLEGE STUDENTS IN HELPING EVERY CHILD TO READ.
   On August 26, 1996, in Wyandotte, Michigan, President Clinton announced his America Reads Challenge, a
    $2.75 billion plan to make sure that every child is literate by the end of 3rd grade.
   In September 1996, he challenged colleges to commit a substantial part of their increase in work-study
    funding -- the FY 1997 Budget included a 35% increase -- to community service, including tutoring reading.
   In November 1996, President Clinton instructed the Secretary of Education to issue a regulation allowing the
    Federal Work-Study Program to pay 100 percent of the wages for students who work as reading tutors for
    elementary school children.
   In December 1996, the President announced the creation of a 21-member steering committee of college
    presidents who volunteered to start their own programs and to encourage other colleges to do the same,
   In February 1997, the President announced the creation of D.C. Reads, a tutoring effort involving seven local
    colleges and universities,
   Today he is reporting on the nationwide involvement of colleges and universities in the America Reads Work
     Study Challenge.

CONGRESS NEEDS TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR THESE AND OTHER
TUTORING EFFORTS. There is enormous interest in America Reads on college campuses and in communities,
but to effectively tap this interest requires a commitment of resources for training, coordination, and materials. That
is why the President insisted that this investment be a part of the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement. The
President's five-year, $2.75 billion proposal, which was forwarded to Congress in April, would fund 25,000 reading
specialists and coordinators to mobilize 1 million tutors for 3 million children in grades K-3 who need help.
Recognizing that parents are their children's first and most important teachers, the America Reads Challenge Act
would also foster effective programs to provide assistance for interested parents to provide the firm foundation their
children need to do well in school and to become successful readers.

THE AMERICA READS INITIATIVE ALSO INCORPORATES OTHER PROGRAMS, including early
childhood development through the expansion of Head Start and Even Start; bringing the best teaching practices to
classrooms; supporting research and evaluation on reading; and building partnerships with the private sector,
including following up on related commitments to the Service Summit. Automated Records Management System.
