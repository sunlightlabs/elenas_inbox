           REPORT ON EXECUTIVE BRANCH GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT
             RELATIONS WITH NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS

I.     Executive Summary -- The Status of Government-to-Government Relations between the
       United States and Tribal Governments

        On April 24, 1994, President Clinton issued the Executive Memorandum on
Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments, which
recognized the unique status of Indian tribes as governments reflected in the United States
Constitution, treaties, statutes, executive orders, and judicial decisions.! The Executive
Memorandum directs all departments and agencies, to the greatest extent practicable and
permitted by law, to work with tribal governments within a framework of
government-to-government relations concerning tribal government, treaty rights and trust
resources.

         The Executive Memorandum has fostered improved working relationships, coordination
and communication between agencies and tribal governments. Several agencies have established
offices, or designated staff within existing offices, to ensure that work on Native American issues.
proceeds within a government-to-government framework. Agency personnel receive training on
the unique governmental status and rights of Indian tribes and frequently meet with tribal leaders,
both in Washington and in tribal communities. Also, Cabinet officers now appear at national
meetings of tribal governments to consult face-to-face with tribal leaders.

       The Administration also has secured important legislation supporting Indian tribes and
has successfully opposed legislative proposals that would undercut tribal self-government. For
example, the White House Offices of Intergovernmental Affairs successfully coordinated
Administration opposition to a recent effort to eliminate tribal sovereign immunity, and last year
the President signed the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act into
law. Under the President's government-to-government relations policy, the Federal Government
works with tribal governments on a basis of mutual respect.

         On May 23, 1997, the White House Chief of Staff requested agency reports on the
implementation of the Executive Memorandum. This report summarizes agency responses
and includes recommendations to improve government-to-government relations and enhance
tribal self-government.

II.    Background of u.s. Relations with Indian Tribes

       Before Europeans landed on America's shores, Indian nations were self-governing

       1  Executive Memorandum on Government-to-Government Relations with Native
American Tribal Governments, 59 Fed. Reg. 22951 (1994).
                                                                      Hex-DiJmp Conversion

societies with remarkable scientific, artistic, and cultural achievements. In order the acquire land
and establish peace, European nations entered into treaties with Indian nations, thereby
recognizing their sovereignty. Since the founding of our nation, the United States has
recognized many Indian tribes as domestic dependent nations with sovereign powers over their
members and territory and has entered into numerous treaties with various tribes pledging
protection and guaranteeing tribal self-government.

         However, throughout our history, Indian peoples have suffered when the United States
has failed to recognize tribal self-governance. From 1887 to 1934 alone, Indian tribes lost
almost 100 million acres of Indian lands, leaving their people destitute. Then, in 1934, President
Roosevelt announced the Indian New Deal -- the Indian Reorganization Act ("IRA"). The
IRA's goal was to revitalize tribal governments to help ensure that Native Americans can
maintain Native languages and cultures and determine their own future. In the 1950s, Congress,
under its Termination Policy, again turned away from its support for tribal self-government and
removed federal recognition from so-called "advanced tribes," effectively ending their
governmental functions.

         In the 1960s, the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations returned to a policy of support
for tribal governments by including tribes in the War on Poverty programs. By 1968, the
Johnson Administration secured passage of the Indian Civil Rights Act which recognized the
right of Indian tribes' to self-government while securing Bill of Rights protections for people
within tribal jurisdictions. In the 1970s, the Nixon Administration built on progress made in the
1960s by declaring the Indian Self-Determination Policy. Implementing legislation authorized
Indian tribes to contract to perform governmental functions (such as education, health care,
public safety, and transportation), that the Departments of Interior and Health and Human
Services had traditionally performed. The Carter, Reagan, and Bush Administrations continued
to follow the Indian Self-Determination Policy without major departure.

        Yet even after these years of federal government attention to the issues of tribal
self-government, many Native Americans continue to be among the poorest people in the nation.
  The 1990 Census reported that 43 of Native American children under five years old fall below
the poverty line.

III.   The Executive Memorandum on Government-to-Government Relations with Native American
       Tribal Governments

        The 1994 Executive Memorandum on Government-to-Government Relations with Native
American Tribal Governments was a milestone in the field of Indian affairs. By directing all
departments and agencies to work on a government-to-government basis with Indian tribes on
issues of tribal self-government, treaty rights, and trust resources; the Executive Memorandum
transformed the way that the Federal Government works with Indian tribes.

                                                 2
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

        In the past, American Indian issues were overlooked by some agencies because they were
considered only relevant to the Department of Interior. However, as a result of the Executive
Memorandum, several departments and agencies established American Indian offices and hired
coordinators in component agencies. For example, the Department of Justice created an Office
of Tribal Justice to perform department-wide coordination of Indian affairs policy, set-up an
American Indian and Alaska Native desk in the Office of Justice Programs, established an Indian
Country Investigations Office at the FBI, and designated Assistant U.S. Attorneys to serve as
tribal government liaisons in Indian country jurisdictions.

         From Agriculture to Veterans' Affairs, departments and agencies are working actively and
effectively with tribal governments. Some highlights of their work include:

·      The Small Business Adrllinistration's Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) has
       established 33 full-time and 73 part-time offices at tribal headquarters to facilitate tribal
       access to NRCS programs.

·      The Department of Energy allocated $15 million in FY97 to support Indian initiatives,
       including fish habitat restoration in the Pacific Northwest, cultural resource protection
       programs, and renewable energy projects.

·      The EPA established an American Indian Environmental Office, adopted a Nine Point
       Plan to strengthen EPA tribal operations, and increased resources for Indian country
       environmental protection from $36 million in FY94 to $137 million in FY98.

·      In FY95, the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") provided over 75
       Tribal JOBS grantees a total of $8,521,220. In FY96, Tribal JOBS grantees assisted
       1,250 AFDC recipients get jobs at an average hourly wage of $6.36.

·      HHS's Indian Health Service transferred over $730 million in FY95 to Indian tribes and
       tribal organizations to support tribal health delivery programs.

·      The Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD")
       secured passage of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act
       of 1996, which promotes tribal self-government by authorizing direct block grants for
       Indian housing.

·      The Department of Interior has instituted formal written policies requiring every bureau
       and office to incorporate trust protection procedures into all planning and operations.

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

·      Since 1995, DOl's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) office has made over
       $43 million in grants to 143 tribal law enforcement agencies to fund over 570 police
       officers in Indian communities.

·      DOl's Violence Against Women Office made $5.7 million in grants to Indian tribes in
       FY97.
·      SBA's loan dollar volume for Native American firms increased by over 50 from FY94 to
       FY96, rising from $52 million to $81 million.

·      The Department of Transportation ("DOT") is seeking passage of the National Economic
       Crossroads Transportation Efficiency Act, which would require states to consult with
       tribal governments in developing transportation improvement plans, and would provide a
       modest increase to $200 million annually for Indian reservation roads.

·      The VA has opened three American Indian "Vet Centers" on Indian reservations to
       provide counseling and other services.

        As these programs demonstrate, the Executive Memorandum has revitalized the nation's
respect for Indian tribes as "domestic dependent nations" and renewed its commitment to honor
the treaty pledges that guarantee tribal self-government.

IV.    Recommendations

       A.     General

      Based on information supplied by the Agencies, we suggest several recommendations to
improve government-to-government relations and enhance tribal self-government:

              1.      Department Policies on Government-to-Government Relations.

       All departments and agencies (including GSA, SBA, State, and Treasury), that have not
adopted a formal policy to implement the Executive Memorandum should consider adopting
such a policy.

              2.      Regulations and Operating Manuals.

      Departments and agencies should consider whether to incorporate their specific policies
on government-to-government relations into their regulations and operating manuals.

              3.      Staff Assignments and Coordination.


                                               4
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

         Departments and agencies should designate intergovernmental affairs or other central
office staff with the responsibility for coordinating agency implementation of the
government-to-government relations policy. Departments and agencies should coordinate
Internet websites on Indian issues and scheduling of major tribal meetings. The White House
Office of Intergovernmental Affairs should host periodic interagency meetings of designated
agency staff to coordinate tribal government issues that affect several agencies. For example,
drug and alcohol abuse in Indian country is of concern to the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, HHS, HUD, Interior, Justice, and Treasury.
                 4.      Existing Authority.

        Departments and agencies should periodically review their programs and operations to
ensure that they are effectively exercising existing authority to promote
government-to-government relations and support tribal self-government. For example, DOD
might review its Indian business development incentives programs and its surplus property
programs to ensure optimal assistance to Indian tribes under existing statutory authority; Interior
might consider applying its Buy Indian Act authority to all component agencies; and all agencies
should implement the Indian employment and training requirements of § 7 (b) of the Indian
Self-Determination Act.

               5.      Authorizing Legislation

        Departments and agencies should review authorizing legislation, and where appropriate,
should seek amendments to ensure treatment of Indian tribes as governments and to remove
impediments to working directly and effectively with Indian tribes. For example, DOT might
review its authorizing legislation to ensure that its scenic by-ways program c<;>mports with
government-to-government relations; Labor might review FLSA and OSHA to ensure that
Indian tribes are treated as governments; and FEMA might review its authorizing legislation to
consider whether an amendment would enable it to work more directly and effectively with tribal
governments.

               6.      Confidential Tribal Communications

       The Administration might consider whether to seek an amendment to the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) to ensure that when Indian tribes communicate confidential" information
to the United States within the framework of government-to-government relations, the
confidential tribal government information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

       B.      Initiatives to Support Tribal Governments

               1.     Education.


                                                 5
                                                                          Hex-DiJmp Conversion


       Given the Administration's emphasis on education in general and the unique Federal
responsibilities to promote Indian education, the Administration and the Department of
Education should consider efforts to restore funding to Indian education programs that have been
cut and to enhance educational programs on Native American languages and cultures. Working
with GSA, the Department of Education might consider avenues to enhance the transfer of
computer technology to elementary and secondary schools on Indian reservations.

               2.      Economic Development.

       An important goal of the longstanding Federal Indian Self-Determination Policy is
economic self-sufficiency for Indian tribes, yet despite recent gains made by a small number of
tribes, many reservation Indians continue to suffer in conditions of economic deprivation. BIA
labor statistics indicate that unemployment rate on some of the large, remote Indian reservations
in the West exceeds 50. The Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, HHS, HUD,
Interior, Justice, and Treasury and the Small Business Administration should consider holding an
interagency summit to plan an economic development initiative for depressed areas of Indian
country.

               3.      Indian Children and Youth

         Early child care and intervention programs present the greatest opportunity for assisting
Indian tribes in promoting healthy tribal communities. This is a critical area of work because,
as noted above, the 1990 Census reported that 43 of Native American children under age five
fall below the poverty line and there is a growing disparity in the health status of Indian children
and youth compared to other American youth. HHS is developing an interagency initiative for
Indian children and youth to promote the physical, mental, social, economic and environmental
well-being of Indian children and youth.

               4.      Indian Country Law Enforcement.

         Given the significant concerns about rising crime rates on reservations, the Department of
Justice, in cooperation with the Department of Interior, is considering steps to enhance law
enforcement in Indian country. The Administration should continue to support these efforts.

               5.      Tribal Courts

        As a complement to efforts to enhance law enforcement in Indian country, the
Departments of Interior and Justice are considering steps to enhance tribal courts, which are
central institutions of tribal government that have been historically under-funded. The
Administration should support these efforts.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
               6.     Indigenous Rights

         The United Nations ("U.N.") has declared 1994-2004 at the Decade of Indigenous
Peoples. Currently, the U.N. and the Organization of American States ("OAS") are considering
declarations on the rights of indigenous peoples. These efforts represent important standard
setting exercises, reflecting many of the positive principles of federal Indian law, and offer the
Administration a historic opportunity to promote understanding and respect' for the rights of
Native Americans, indigenous peoples in the Americas and indigenous peoples throughout the
world. The Administration should consider focusing attention on these initiatives to bring them
to fruition.

V.     Department and Agency Reports on Government-to Government Relations with Tribal
       Governments

       A.      Department of Agriculture (USDA)

               1.     Policy on Government-to-Government Relations.

        USDA policy recognizes that Indian tribes possess the right of self-government and the
right to manage American Indian resources. USDA pledges to consult with tribal governments,
share technical skills and information, and coordinate with other agencies.

               2.     Native American Programs Director, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs

      The Director serves as USDA's principal adviser on American Indian policy and
programs and the primary liaison with tribal governments; chairs USDA's Native American
Working Group; and assists the Under Secretary for Rural Development with the work of the
Domestic Policy Council Working Group on American Indians and'Alaska Natives.

               3.     Improved Working Relations with Indian Tribes

       The Farm Service Agency (FSA), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), Forest Service
(FS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Food and Consumer Service (FCS),
Rural Development (RD), Marketing and Regulatory Programs, and Office of Civil Rights have
designated American Indian coordinators who serve as liaisons with tribal governments.

        The FY 1996 USDA funding level American Indians and Alaska Natives programs was
$146 million, the estimated FY 1997 program level is $189 million, and the anticipated FY 1998
program level is $212 million. These funds support USDA initiatives for food and nutrition
assistance, rural development loans and grants, extension, and conservation practices.

         USDA is conducting outreach efforts to tribal governments and communities to ensure
that they have access to its programs. USDA is publishing a Guide to USDA Programs for
American Indians and Alaska Natives. For the first time, the Agriculture Fact Book 1997
includes a summary of highlights of recent activities and programs in USDA mission areas which
serve Indian tribes and their members. FS recently published the Forest Service National
Resource Book on Amen'can Indian and Alaska Native Relations to promote cooperative
relations with Indian tribes. FSA, FAS, NCRS, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) and the Risk Management Agency (RMA) are implementing a 5-year joint outreach
effort with the Intertribal Agriculture Council to increase awareness of USDA services available to
tribal communities.

        NRCS has established 33 full-time and 73 part-time offices at tribal headquarters and
plans to locate an additional 47 full-time offices at tribal headquarters during the next 2 years.
NRCS has conducted 20 "Working Effectively with American Indians" workshops in 10 states;
these sessions focus on historical, legal, and cultural issues that are significant for effective
program delivery to American Indians and Alaska Natives.

        USDA has increased emphasis on economic development and programs in tribal
commumtIes. RD, working at the national, State, and local level to provide financial and
technical assistance directly to tribal governments, has increased investments in tribal water and
waste programs, housing, community facilities, and business projects. RD also adopted a policy
acknowledging tribal government authority to apply Tribal Employment Rights Ordinances in
certain contracts and grants on Indian reservations.

         FCS administers the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) and
the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and, in
many instances, Indian Tribal Organizations deliver services to program participants. In
consultation with tribal leaders and tribally appointed FDIPR Directors, USDA modified the
FDPIR food package to improve its nutritional value and increase its appeal, without increasing
its costs, and initiated and expanded the FDPIR Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Pilot Project (FFV),
under which fresh produce is available to tribes. FCS worked with American Indian WIC
advisers to develop an award winning fetal alcohol syndrome prevention video.

        The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) works
with the 29 designated Land-Grant Tribal Colleges to provide an annual award to strengthen
instruction programs in the food and agricultural sciences and to disburse the interest from an
endowment fund to each of these institutions. USDA's new Tribal Colleges Extension Program,
established in October 1997, will support training and education in production agriculture,
business management, community and family development, 4-H and youth leadership, natural
resources and conservation, nutrition, diet, and health.

        APHIS has founded its Native American Working Group to improve communication and
delivery of services to Indian tribes, and enters into Memoranda of Understanding or cooperative
agreements with Indian tribes to provide a wide variety of services to protect resources and
human health and safety.

        The Office of Civil Rights sponsored education programs for USDA staff and tribal
representatives on building partnerships with tribal governments and on tribal realty and land
management. USDA recently published the Civil Rights at the United States Department of
Agriculture, A Report by the Civil Rights Action Team, which contains recommended actions,
including Indian-specific recommendations, which USDA will implement to remedy its
long-standing civil rights problems.

Reservation.

        Though the Economic Development Administration ("EDA") grant programs have been
substantially reduced, within its resources, the EDA has established the Indian Planning Program
(IPP) to support tribal formulation and implementation of economic development programs.
IPP is intended to help create and sustain full-time permanent jobs for Native Americans, with a
focus on those who are unemployed or underemployed. Currently, sixty tribes receive IPP
funding.

       The Minority Business Administration at Commerce has established an Office of Native
American Programs, with eight Native American Business Development Centers and a business
consultant, that provides management and technical assistance to Native American businesses.

        The National Oceonographic and Atmospheric Administration has a Memorandum of
Understanding with the American Indian Science and Engineering Society that promotes
educational, internship and employment opportunities for Native American students and
professionals. The Patent and Trademark office also has several programs to improve
educational opportunities for students at tribal community colleges.

        Finally, the National Telecommunication and Information Administration (''NTIA'') is
working with Indian tribes to extend the benefits of the Internet to tribal communities. Since

       2.      Office of Congressional Affairs and Intergovernmental Relations

        GSA has designated the Office of Congressional Mfairs and Intergovernmental Relations
as the primary GSA liaison with tribal governments.

       3.     Improved Working Relationships with Tribal Governments

       GSA has been working directly with tribal governments on a. number of issues:

              a.      Surplus and Real Property Transfers.

        Under the Property Act of 1949, GSA has authority to transfer excess real property within
Indian reservations to the Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust for Indian tribes. From
FY92 through FY97, GSA transferred approximately 7,058 acres under this authority. In
addition, GSA has authority to transfer excess personal property, and from October 1, 1996

                                                20
                                                                Records Mam:gementSystcm
                                                             !-IeA-Dilmp C;uiIVi;,Jion
through May 31, 1997, GSA transferred 6,727 items of personal property (pens to desks to cars)
to Indian tribes with a dollar value of $31,345.
                b.     Travel and Transportation Payment and Expense Control System.

        Under the Indian Self-Determination Act, tribal governments may use discounted U.S.
government fares for tribal government travel. GSA enters into contracts with numerous airlines
for the discounted fares. Tribal government may use these contracts by first obtaining government
travel charge accounts from American Express Travel Related Services, Inc.

               c.      Federal Telecommunications Service.

         Under the Indian Self-Determination Act, when carrying out self-determination contracts,
tribal governments may use GSA's long-distance rate, video, and voice telecommunications
services, as well as local telecommunications and wireless services. In December 1996, a MOU
between the DOl and GSA was executed which allows tribal governments to order these services
directly from GSA. Since then, a number of tribal entities have signed individual MOU's with
GSA to access these services.

               d.      Computers to Schools.

         Executive Order 12999 permits Indian reservation schools (BIA schools) to obtain
computers from GSA for their primary and secondary students under the same procedures
available to all other educational facilities. At the time of GSA's report in August, 1997, no
transfers had yet been made under this authority.

               e.     Sacred Sites.

       GSA is preparing a memorandum for the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy
regarding implementation of Executive Order 13007, regarding Indian Sacred Sites.

I.     Health and Human Services (HHS)

       1.      Policy on Govemment to Government Relations

Indian tribes and the Federal trust responsibility to Indian tribes. It also encourages maximum
participation by Indian people in Indian health planning and services, directs components to
consult with, assess program impacts on, and remove procedural impediments to working with
Indian tribes, and pledges to collaborate with other agencies to this end.          .

       2.      Director, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs

                                                 21

        Until a planned tribal consultation division is established in that office, the Director of the
Office of Intergovernmental Affairs is the HHS tribal government liaison. HHS has
recommended that component agencies designate individual tribal points of contact.
       3.       Improved Working Relationships with Tribal Governments

         In both 1995 and 1996, the Administration on Aging awarded over $15 million in grants
to 221 tribal organizations to provide supportive and nutrition services to tribal elders. The
Administration for Children and Families (ACF) holds trainings for tribes on ACF programs and
Head Start. In FY96, the American Indian Head Start Program provided $98 million to 130
grantees representing 144 Indian tribes and 8 Alaska Native Regional Corporations serving 35
villages and cities. The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) administers programs to
enhance tribal economic development, environmental protection, and Native languages and
cultures.

       In the Office of Community Services, the Family Violence Prevention & Services
Program provided $4.5 million in grants to 140 Indian tribes and tribal organizations in FY96,
and the Community Services Block Grant allocation for Indian tribes to reduce poverty in tribal
communities was $2.3 million in FY96. The Child Care Bureau provided $28 million in grants
to 225 tribal consortia representing over 500 Indian tribes and Alaska Native Villages in child
care and development block grants. The Office of Child Support Enforcement created a Native
American Working Group and significantly increased its efforts in this area since the enactment of
the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Act ("TANF") in 1996.

         In FY95, tribal Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) training grantees assisted 1,250
AFDC recipients get jobs at an average hourly wage of $6.36. ]TPA and JOBS held numerous
consultations and provided technical assistance to tribes around the country. The Office of Family
Assistance administers the JOBS and in FY96, more than 75 Tribal JOBS grantees received a
total of $8,521,220.

        The Indian Health Service (IHS) worked with DOl to revise Indian Self-Determination
contract regulations through negotiated rule-making with Indian tribes. In FY95, IHS
transferred over $730 million to Indian tribes and tribal organizations to support tribal health
delivery programs. For FY96, IHS negotiated 29 self-governance compacts and 42 annual
funding agreements, and transferred approximately $300 million to 197 tribes in Alaska and 28
tribal governments in the lower 48 states.

       4.      Coordination with other Executive Departments and Agencies

        HHS works closely with the DPC Working Group on American Indians and Alaska
Natives. HHS is also working with DOJ and DOl on welfare reform and child support

               a.      Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).

        TANF replaces AFDC, Emergency Assistance, and JOBS money with a block grant
available to Indian tribes. HHS has established a new Division of Tribal Services within the
Administration for Children and Families to provide program assistance to tribes seeking to
administer their own TANF programs. They have published Tribal Guidance for TANF
Program which explains the new provisions to tribes. HHS and DOJ worked to craft technical
amendments to the T ANF legislation that would accommodate the unique economic situation in
Indian country and allow for the establishment of realistic time limits, set by the Secretary in
consultation with tribes, for tribal members.

J.     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

       1.      Policy on Government-to-Government Relations

        HUD has adopted a departmental policy on government-to-government relations, which
recognizes the unique status of tribal governments, the trust responsibility, and emphasizes
HUD's special responsibility to promote safe, sanitary housing for low income families and its
goal of maximizing Indian self-determination ·through Indian Housing Authority administration
of programs in tribal communities.

       2.      Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office ofNative American Programs

        HUD established the Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) under the direction
of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Indian Housing serves as ONAP's administrator and primary HUD liaison with tribal
governments. The Deputy Assistant Secretary has offices in Washington, D.C., but ONAP's
main offices are in Denver, Colorado, close to Indian country. ONAP also has field offices in
Chicago, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Seattle, and Anchorage.

       3.      Improved Working Relationships with Indian Tribes

        In 1996, the Administration secured passage of the Native American Housing Assistance
and Self-Determination Act, which promotes tribal self-government by authorizing direct block
grants to Indian housing authorities, under the direction of tribal governments.

       In 1995, HUD issued a policy on Customer Service which requires HUD personnel to
adopt certain core principles for interaction with Indian tribes and tribal members consistent with
the Executive Memorandum on Government-to-Government Relations.

       4.      Coordination with Other Executive Departments and Agencies

        HUD entered into an Interdepartmental Agreement with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and
the Indian Health Service to improve the delivery of services and financial assistance to tribal and
Indian Housing authorities through better interagency communication. HUD's CODETALK,
an interagency Indian program website, is available to Indian programs at other federal agencies,

       5.      Current Initiatives to Support Tribal Self-Government

        HUD is currently working with tribal governments through a negotiated rule-making
process to develop regulations to implement the Native American Housing Assistance and
Self-Determination Act.

               a.      Operation Safe Home.

         HUD's Operation Safe Home campaign is a continuing initiative begun in 1994 to
combat crime in HUD housing, with a special focus on violent crime and criminal gang activity.
 Programs that facilitate eviction of habitual criminals from HUD housing and removal of gang
graffiti are operated in Indian country.

               b.     Native American Women and Youth

        HUD is working together with Native American women and youth to strengthen
leadership ability and fight drug and alcohol abuse through peer counseling and leadership
training workshops.

               c,      Boys & Girls Club

        Recognizing that Native American youth face many socioeconomic difficulties and
disadvantages, HUD has teamed with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America to promote
comprehensive club development in Indian Country. More than twenty clubs are currently
operating in Indian country, serving Native American youth aged five to nineteen. The clubs
provide athletic and cultural activities for young people and focus on the problems of drugs,
alcohol and teen pregnancy.

J.     Department of Interior (DOn

       1.      PoJicy on Government-to-Government Relations

      Secretary Babbitt has ordered component agencies to establish guidelines for
implementing the Executive Memorandum on Government-to-Government Relations.                   The

Secretarial order (which requires agencies to establish written guidance to enhance tribal
consultation, improve agency coordination, and ensure compliance with the trust responsibility) is
included in the Department Manual, and DOl agencies have promulgated agency policies
pursuant to that Order.

       2.      Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs and Director, Office of American Indian Trust

        The Assistant Secretary for Indian Mfairs is DOl's primary liaison with Indian tribes.
Several Interior component agencies have established agency liaisons with Indian tribes, and these
agency liaisons coordinate with the Director of the Office of American Indian Trust, who has
primary responsibility for ensuring department-wide implementation of the
government-to-government relations policy and trust procedures.

       3.      Improved Working ReJationships with Indian Tribes

        The Secretary and Assistant Secretary actively consult with Indian tribes on issues'
important to tribal governments, including Indian lands, water rights, tribal governmental
authority, and the application of federal law in Indian country. Efforts to establish better
working relationships with Indian tribes have included the use of the negotiated rulemaking
process in the development of the new regulations for the Indian Self-Determination Act and the
Indian Self-Governance Act. DOl has expanded its use of memoranda of understanding and
negotiations on a wide variety of issues, including the implementation of the Endangered Species
Act in Indian country. Much of this work is effected by the small tribal liaison offices
established in each Bureau to advance the Federal Indian Self-Determination Policy, ensure
fulfillment of the trust responsibility, and improve government-to-government relations.

       4.      Coordination with Other Executive Departments and Agencies

        The Secretary chairs the Domestic Policy Council's Inter-Departmental Working Group
on American Indians and Alaska Natives, and has fostered an unprecedented level of cooperation
between coordinate agencies. Interior works closely with DO] on Indian country law
enforcement and litigation related to tribal governments, treaty rights, and trust resources. Other
agencies, such as DOD,EPA, DOE, and HHS, are routinely invited to Interior consultations
with Indian tribes. Interior works with the White House Office of Intergovernmental Mfairs on
issues of national importance to tribal leaders.

       5.      Current Initiatives to Support TribaJ Self-Government

               a.     Implementation of the Indian Self-Determination Act Amendments and the
                      Indian Self-Governance Act.


                                                 27
self-determination contracting and self-governance contracting to ensure that Indian tribes are able
to undertake management of governmental services to the Indian peoples. Since the enactment
of the Indian Self-Governance Act of 1991, 203 Indian tribes have entered into self-governance
compacts.

               b.      Advancing Tribal Sovereignty.

        DOl has an ongoing program to advance tribal sovereignty, which recently resulted in the
streamlining of federal acknowledgment process regulations and the recognition of 223 Alaska
Native villages as Indian tribes.

               c.      Implementing the Executive Order on Sacred Sites

       The Office of American Indian Trust facilitated interagency consultations with tribal
governments on the Executive Order on Sacred Sites and developed important agency guidance
for implementing the Executive Order.

               d.      Endangered Species Act

         Recognizing that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) may impact tribal treaty rights and
trust resources, DOl conducted a series of consultations with Indian tribes and developed a
MOU on the implementation of the ESA in Indian country.

               e.      Furthering Federal-Tribal Consultation

        Each DOl bureau is now bound by departmental policy to consult with tribes on a
government-to-government basis. Currently, many of the offices are also developing specific
internal procedures for consultation with Indian tribes. The new consultation procedures have
made it easier for Indian tribes to work with DOl agencies on issues such as tribal historic
preservation.

       In addition, each bureau has instituted several activities to support tribal self-governance,
improve and expand services to tribes, effect better relationships, enhance education and outreach,
improve access to information, resolve conflicts, and improve communications. Internal training
and education efforts are on-going.

       6.      Area of Concern -- Confidential Tribal Information.

       The United States works with Indian tribes through government-to-government
consultation with tribes. Consultation may result in the sharing of confidential information, and

                                                28
the United States' ability to defend tribal interests and could therefore chilI communications.
DOl and DO] are working on agreements on a case-by-case basis to establish consultant status
for tribes, so that confidential tribal information is FOIA exempt. The Administration could
consider a more global solution to the problem by proposing an amendment to FOIA.

L.     Department of Iustice (DOT)

       1.      Policy on Government-to-Government Relations with Indian Tribes

         DO] Policy recognizes Indian tribes as domestic dependent nations and pledges support
for tribal self-government. DO] policy directs components to work with tribes on a
government-to-government basis, to remove impediments to working directly with Indian tribes,
and to work cooperatively with other federal agencies on Indian issues.

       2.      Office of Tribal Justice (OTJ)

       Established under the Executive Memorandum on Government-to-Government Relations,
OT] functions to: (1) provide a government-to-government communication channel between
DO] and Indian tribes; (2). coordinate Indian affairs policy within DO] and with other agencies;
and (3) promote DO] government-to-government relations with Indian Tribes.

       3.      Improved Working Relationships with Indian Tribes

         U.S. Anorneys with jurisdiction in Indian country each appointed Assistant U.S. Anorneys
as tribal liaisons to improve criminal justice and enhance working relations with Indian tribes.
The FBI created an Office of Indian Country Investigations, assigned thirty new Indian country
agents in FY97, and requested 30 more Indian country agents for FY98.

         In consultation with Indian tribes and the Department of Interior (DOl), the
Environment and Natural Resources Division and Office of the Solicitor General support tribal
interests in cases involving tribal government, treaty rights, tribal lands, waters, and natural
resources, and environmental regulation. The Solicitor General is currently supporting tribal
sovereign immunity and Indian reservation boundaries before the Supreme Court, and the
Environment Division's Indian Resources Section is supporting tribal environmental protection
programs in the lower federal courts. The Civil Rights Division protects Indian and Alaska
Native civil rights (including voting rights), and recently, won notable lending and education
discrimination cases. The Community Relations Service assists tribes in resolving community
disputes.

       The Office of Justice Programs (O]P) created an American Indian and Alaska Native desk

                                                29
                                                                     t :\~;""UIJII'(J v(;j"h,"v,..i;\:kl   ·

to ensure that Indian tribes have access to DOJ funded programs, and OJP funds domestic
violence programs, drug courts, corrections, victims services, and multi-disciplinary crime
prevention and other programs in Indian country. The Violence Against Women Office made
$5.7 million in grants to Indian tribes in FY97. Since 1995, the Community Oriented Policing
Services (COPS) Office has made over $43 million in grants to 143 tribal law enforcement
agencies for over 570 officers in Indian communities. OJP's Bureau of Justice Statistics initiated
projects to improve tribal law enforcement information systems, the National Institute of Justice is
researching crime in Indian country, and the Bureau of Prisons provides technical assistance to
tribal governments through the National Institute of Corrections,

       4.      Coordination with other Executive Departments and Agencies

        DOJ works closely with the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and DOl
on Indian policy issues. DOJ also works with USDA on tribal self-government and tribal lands
issues, with DOD and EPA on environmental enforcement policy for Indian country, with the
Comptroller of the Currency on Indian banking issues, and with HHS and IHS on welfare
reform and youth and family issues in Indian country.

       5.      Current Initiatives to Support Tribal Self-Govemment

               a.      Indian Country Law Enforcement

       Pursuant to the President's directive on Indian country law enforcement, DOJ is working
with DOl and Indian tribes to develop options for the President to improve public safety and law
enforcement in Indian country.

               b.      Tribal Courts

         DOJ is also working actively with DOl on tribal courts issues because they are central
institutions of tribal self-government. Working in cooperation with DOl, DOJ has proposed a
Tribal Court Enhancement Bill, which is pending with OMB. This legislation is important to
ensure that tribal courts may take their place as true partners with federal and state courts in our
nationwide system of justice.

               c.      Indigenous Rights

       DOJ is working with the State Department and DOl on the OAS and U.N. Draft
Declarations on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. These declarations offer an important
opportunity for the United States to support the rights of indigenous peoples throughout the
Americas (and the world) and for the Administration to establish a lasting legacy in the field of
indigenous rights.

                                                 30

       1.      Policy on Government-to-Government Relations

       DOL has drafted a policy, but it has not yet been finalized.

       2.      Division of Indian and Native American Programs

       The Division of Indian and Native American Programs is the primary Labor liaison with
Indian tribes. Labor consults with tribes about employment and training issues through the
DOL Native American Employment and Training Council, whose charter was recently renewed
by the Secretary for another two-year term. The Council meets not less than twice annually to
consider policy, regulations, performance measures, and information technology.          .

       3.      Improved Working Relationships with Indian Tribes

        The Division of Indian and Native American Programs seeks to work with Indian tribes
and tribal grantees as "partners" in the administration of employment and training programs.

       4.      Coordination with other Executive Departments and Agencies

       The Division of Indian and Native American Labor has been working with HHS's
Indian Health Service and other departments and agencies on an initiative for American Indian
and Alaska Native Youth.

       5.      Areas of Concern

        Indian tribes have expressed concern that Labor seeks to apply the labor laws contained
within the Fair Labor Standards Act and Occupational Safety and Health Act to Indian tribes,
although the statutes do not expressly refer to Indian tribes and do not contain provisions to treat
Indian tribes as governments. The statutes do contain special provisions for state governments,
and consideration should be given to amending the statutes to provide similar protections for
tribal governments.

o      Small Business Administration (SBA)

       1.      Policy on Government-to-Government Relations with Indian Tribes

      SBA does not have a formal written policy to implement the Executive Memorandum on
Government-to-Government Relations with Tribal Governments.

                                                 31

       2.      Office of Native American Affairs (ONAA)

         ONAA coordinates SBA policy, develops legislative and regulatory initiatives on Indian
issues, serves as tribal government liaison and technical assistance provider, and provides outreach
to enhance tribal access to SBA programs. ONAA has an annual National Native American
Small Business Conference.




                                                32

         Through ONAA, SBA has new and innovative methods to encourage tribal economic
development. ONAA partners with other SBA program offices and Federal and state agencies
to assist Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to develop business skills and access to
capital. The Office of Women Owned Business opened two centers in reservation communities.
  ONAA facilitates intertribal economic development and joint venture partnerships for tribal
organizations. SBA District Offices also facilitate business partnerships for tribal governments,
support tribally-owned SBA 8(a) small disadvantaged business enterprises, and promote tribal
opportunities for access to capital and credit markets.

       4.      Coordination with other Executive Departments and Agencies

        Since 1995, in conjunction with the DOl's Bureau of Indian Affairs, ONAA established
seventeen Indian reservation-based Tribal Business Information Centers to provide a full range of
technical assistance and business and program information for small businesses.

       5.      Current Initiatives to Suppon Tribal Self-Government

        SBA is now working on regulatory reforms to remove impediments to working with
tribal governments.

o      Department of State (DOS)

       1.      Policy on Government-to-Government Relations with Indian Tribes

      State has not adopted a written policy on government-to-government relations with tribal
governments.

       2.      Under Secretary for. Global and Environmental Affairs

       The Under-Secretary for Global and Environmental Affairs has coordinated the State
Department's consultations with tribal governments. Several State Department bureaus have
been involved in indigenous issues, most notably the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and
Labor.

       3.      Improved Working Relationships w{th Indian Tribes

       State has several matters relating to tribal governments: (1) the U.N. Draft Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; (2) the OAS Draft Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples; (3) the Arctic Council Declaration; (4) Section 80) of the International

                                                33
                                                                    I :c;,"UI.W'.J \,AJ.htv,J:Ji I "



Convention on Bio-diversity; and (5) International whaling and fishing agreements.

        The U.N. Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the OAS Draft
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples hold great promise for the future of indigenous
peoples worldwide. The declarations represent an important standard-setting exercise, providing
protections for indigenous local self-governance, lands and natural resources, religions, cultures,
languages, and freedom from discrimination.

       4.      Coordination with other Executive Departments and Agencies

        State works closely with Justice and Interior on the U.N. and OAS Draft Declarations on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In cooperation with Interior and Justice, ~tate has held
consultations with tribal governments on these initiatives in Washington and around the nation.

       5.      Key Areas for Future Development to Support Tribal Self-Government

        In essence, both the U.N. and OAS Draft Declarations on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples present an historic opportunity to reinforce the positive aspects of Federal law relating to
American Indians and Alaska Natives, and provide similar protections for indigenous peoples
throughout the Americas and around the World. Many Indian tribes view the adoption of the
declarations as a milestone in their efforts to foster respect for tribal self-governance. Because
the declarations present issues which interest a number of agencies there is a need for high-level
Administration commitment and definitive guidance to realize progress on the declarations. The
OAS Draft Declaration presents an immediate opportunity for progress for indigenous peoples
because strong Administration support and policy guidance could very well result in its adoption
in 1998 or 1999.

P      Department of Transportation (DOT)

       1.      Policy on Government-to-Government Relations with Indian Tribes

       Though DOT has not issued a department-wide policy, most operating administrations
have informally. incorporated the requirements of the Executive Memorandum into their activities.
 FHWA and FAA are developing agency policies on government-to-government relations.

       2.      Governmental Affairs

        Deputy Assistant Secretary for Governmental Affairs serves as DOT's principal liaison
with tribal governments.

       3.      Improved Working Relationships with Indian Tribes

        DOT consults with tribal governments in transportation planning processes, in the
development and implementation of policies that impact tribes (such as NEXTEA, the surface
transportation reauthorization proposal), and specific projects. FHWA, FTA, and DOl's BIA
have developed guidelines for including Indian tribes in federal and state transportation planning
under ISTEA, and have worked to increase state-tribal cooperation. The Federal Lands
Highway program (within FHWA) works cooperatively with the BIA to implement the $191
million Indian Reservation Roads Transportation Improvement Program (IRR). About
one-third of the IRR program is carried out by Indian tribes, and under the Indian
Self-Determination Act, the Buy-Indian Act, and the Tribal Employment Rights Ordinances
(TEROs), over 82 of the IRR projects employed Indians or Indian firms. The Local
Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) was expanded to provide services to tribal governments
and there are six Native American LTAP centers.

         The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has provided technical
support to tribal government safety programs, focusing on alcohol safety, occupant protection,
and effective police traffic services. Recognizing that Native Americans die from motor vehicle
crashes at rates up to three times greater than other Americans, NHTSA has emphasized
face-to-face communication with tribal leaders concerning traffic safety. States are required to
include Indian tribes in a fair distribution of funds under FTA's non-urbanized formula assistance
program.

       FAA is conducting consultations with neighboring Indian tribes concerning overflights of
the Grand Canyon National Park and a Native American representative serves on the National
Park Overflight working group.

      The Coast Guard is working with Indian tribes regarding marine safety and with the
American Indian Science and Engineering Society to promote Coast Guard career opportunities.

      The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business encourages the participation of Native
American small businesses, among others, to participate in DOT-funded and assisted projects.

       4.      Coordination with Other Executive Departments and Agencies

         FHWA hosted a Native American issues conference in Denver in January 1997, and
invited BIA and DOJ to participate. DOT's General Counsel is working with FAA, DOJ and
DOD to consult with tribal governments in New Mexico about their complaints regarding
aircraft noise interference with their religious ceremonies.

       5.      Current Initiatives to Support Tribal Self-Government

        DOT is working toward the enactment of the Administration's National Economic
Crossroads Transportation Efficiency Act (NEXTEA), which reiterates ISTEA's requirements of
state consultation with tribal governments in state transportation improvement plans, and provides
an increase to $200 million annually for the Indian Reservation Road program.

                 b.     FM Policy on Government-to-Government Relations.

          FM is currently developing a policy on government-to-government relations with Indian
tribes.

Q.        Department of Treasury

          1.     Policy on Government-to-Government Relations with Indian Tribes

on Government-to-Government Relations with Tribal Governments.

          2.     Public Liaison

        The Assistant Secretary for Public Liaison is the Department's designated liaison with
tribal governments.

          3.     Improved Working Relationships with Indian Tribes

        Treasury's working relations with tribal governments cover banking, financial services, tax,
and community development issues. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is
working to improve banking and lending in Indian country, issuing a guide to mortgage lending
in Indian country, providing technical assistance to Indian tribes that operate or acquire national
banks, and with DO], cosponsoring a Banking in Indian COUfltlJ' conference attended by over
500 tribal leaders and bankers. The Comptroller has successfully encouraged national banks to
open new branches in Indian country.

       Treasury and the IRS have published the Indian Assistance Handbook to provide
guidance to promote uniform application of the federal tax laws in Indian country and the
Handbook recognizes that Indian tribes are not subject to federal income tax under existing law.

          4.     Coordination with Other Agencies

          Working together with the White House Offices of Intergovernmental Affairs and
