            Please look at revised and give me any comments tonight.     Where I had
            conflicting comments I took Bruce's. Let me flag:

            (I') While Tom didn't jump at the chance to make a moral case for purchase
            guarantees, we worked in the concept under farmers.  (I also added
            affected rural communities under the menu)

             (2) Treasury believes the state settlement plus a) 55 cents b) accelerated
            excise tax and c) FDA we will cut youth smoking in half. However, I left
            this point out because of Bruce's concern we couldn't have it both ways
            (downplay the tax amount and still say we're meeting our goal).   Treasury
            believes the state settlement plus the other price increases will reduce
            youth smoking by 30 percent (this includes a very small nonprice effect
            which rises to 10 percent under our plan when full FDA authority is ass
            umed) .

            (3) I added more on FDA as suggested -- any comments?

            (4) Linda Ricci is on alert we may need to pull the Medicare graph -- she
            will let me know the drop dead time.

 Subject:        Edits to OMB's tobacco write-up


 Here's my effort to edit OMB's tobacco budget section -- I'm still not
 sure it strikes the right tone.  In particular, how do you want to
 describe the price increase? Do you want to say it will enable us to cut
 youth smoking in half?  I edited that and other parts out to tone it down
 a bit.
 Also, do you want the Medicare suit in there?  I added it.  I also took a
 stab at farmers.   I'll tell Linda Ricci we're working on it.

Stopping Youth Smoking:         Every day, 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1,000 have
their lives shortened because of it. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers began smoking by age
18 and today, 4.5 million children aged 12 to 17 -- 37 percent of all high school students --
smoke cigarettes. Tobacco is linked to over 400,000 deaths a year from cancer, respiratory
illness, heart disease and other problems. To end this public health crisis, we must have a
focused public health effort to reduce youth smoking. The 1998 State Attorneys General Tobacco
S state tobacco settlement was an important step in the right direction, as the tobacco industry
affirmed its responsibility to pay for health care costs caused by tobacco. but more must be
done to protect our children and preserve public health hold the tobacco industry accountable.
The Administration is pursuing a two pronged approach believes a few key additional steps to
reduce youth smoking must be taken at the national level:

   Raise the price of cigarettes, so fewer young people start to smoke.    Public health experts agree
   that the single most effective way to cut youth smoking is to raise the price of cigarettes:
   For e'lery 10 cents additional per pack, estimates shO'.'t' that 270,000 fewer teenagers ,,.,,ill
   begin smoking over the next five years and more than 90,000 premature deaths 'if ill be
   a'ioided as a result. Last year, the President called for an increase of $1.10 per pack (in
   constant dollars) to help cut youth smoking in half'ifithin five years. This year, we can
   build on the increases already agreed to between the tobacco companies and the states and
   those already legislated by the Congress and lA.-s a result, we can '/l'Ork '!lith the Congress and,
   '!lith a single propose an increase of only half this amount. reach the target this year.

   The funds that result from this policy will cover tobacco-related health care costs. Each year,
   the Federal government spends billions of dollars treating tobacco-related diseases --m for our
   armed forces, our veterans, and our federal employees others. It is fitting that the tobacco
   industry reimburse US taxpayers for these costs, just as it has already agreed to do for the
   states.

   -Give Reaffirm the Food and Drug Administration}. fuD authority to keep cigarettes out of the
   hands of children and support critical public health efforts to preyent youth smoking. The
   Administration will again propose legislation that confirms the FDA's authority to regulate
   tobacco products: to halt advertising targeted at children, and to make sure that cigarettes are
   not sold to them. To help curb youth access to tobacco products and support tobacco
   prevention programs in states and local communities, the Administration's budget will
   double the funding for the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco budget to $68 million and
   increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control's tobacco control efforts by one-third,
   from $73 to $100 million. Moreover, the Administration will continue to support measures
   to hold the tobacco industry accountable for reducing youth smoking.

   Protect farmers and farming communities.    The Administration is committed to working with
   all parties to protect tobacco farmers and their communities, and will monitor closely
   on-going efforts by the states and private industry should additional actions be needed.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

       Since US taxpayers paid a substantial portion of the Medicaid costs that were the basis for
much of the state settlement with the tobacco companies, Federal law requires that the Federal
government recoup its share. However, the Administration will again support legislation to
waive direct federal recoupment, if states agree to use a portion of fumis from the settlement for
programs curreRtly financed by federal ta)'payers. is open to working with the states to enact
tobacco legislation that, among other things, resolves these federal claims in exchange for a
commitment by the states to use tobacco money for specified activities including public health
and children's programs.

       In addition to these Medicaid costs, tobacco-related health problems have cost the
Medicare program billions of dollars over the last three decades. To recover these losses,
the U,S. Department of Justice intends to bring suit against the tobacco industry, and the
new FY 2000 budget will contain $20 million to pay for the necessary legal costs. All
recoveries will be used to preserve and protect Medicare for future generations.

   America's children are protected from the next generation of tobacco industry marketing.
   We should take this matter out of the courts and ensure that the FDA -- the nation's leading
