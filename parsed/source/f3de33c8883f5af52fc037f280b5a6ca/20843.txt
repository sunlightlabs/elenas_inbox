 The Department of LaborO,s Joint Liability Statement

 Garment workers are some of the most vulnerable in todayD,s workplace.
 News accounts abound of all too frequent exploitation 0) intimidation to
 work long hours in sweatshops without overtime compensation in unhealthy
 and unsafe work environments.  In fact, some garment workers toil over
 machines for days and even weeks without any compensation. The problem is
 likely even more acute than reported because these workers are too
 frightened to speak publicly or complain to law enforcement agencies. At
 a March Congressional hearing, workers from some of New York CitY0,s


 Chinatown garment factories only agreed to present their stories of abuse
 in the workplace with the promise of anonymity and behind partitions.

 It is estimated that there are approximately 800,000 garment workers in
 the United States. Enforcement actions alone cannot bring the more than
 20,000 contract sewing and cutting shops into compliance. The recent
 Department of Labor survey in Los Angeles found for the second time in two
 years that only 39 percent of the shops there are in compliance with labor
 laws. A similar survey in New York City last year found only 37 percent
 of the garment shops there in compliance.

 In order to make progress in eliminating sweatshops in the extremely
 price-competitive garment industry in the U.S., it is essential to make
 all the players in the industry --the garment manufacturers, retailers,
 and their contractors -- everyone up and down the "food chain" --
 responsible for compliance with labor laws.

 As a matter of principle, the Department of Labor supports the approach
 taken by the proposed legislation to make every enterprise in this
 industry -- from top to bottom -- accept responsibility for ensuring that
 the industryD,s workers are paid at least the minimum wage, that they get
 the overtime pay they are due, and that their working conditions meet the
 standards required by law.

 Last winter, had there been a law explicitly making manufacturers and
 retailers responsible for back wages, some 73 New York City garment
 workers at the Laura and Sarah Chinatown sweatshop    who had not been
 regularly paid for months    would likely have received more of their
 wages owed and much sooner.

 We are pleased that the legislation has the support of 90 co-sponsors in
 the House of Representatives. This is a very positive indication of the
 level of support there is for eliminating sweatshops in this country.

 Sweatshops should be relegated to the history books.  They should not be a
 topic for our children to discuss in current events class.

 HR 23 IH

                                105th CONGRESS

                                 1st Session

                                   H.   R.   23

 To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide for legal
 accountability for sweatshop conditions in the garment industry, and for
 other purposes.

                       IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                               January 7, 1997

 Mr. CLAY introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee


on Education and the Workforce



                                   A BILL

TO amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide for legal
accountability for sweatshop conditions in the garment industry, and for
other purposes.

     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
     States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.

     (a) SHORT TITLE- This Act may be cited as the 'Stop Sweatshops Act of
     1997' .

     (b) REFERENCE- Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is
     expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or
     other provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a
     section or other provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

     The Congress makes the following findings:

           (1) The production of garments in violation of minimum labor
          standards burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce
          by spreading and perpetuating labor conditions that undermine
          minimum living standards and by providing an unfair means of
          competition to the detriment of employers who comply with the
          law.

          (2) The existence of working conditions detrimental to fair
          competition and the maintenance of minimum standards of living
          necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of
          workers are a continuing and growing problem in the domestic
          garment industry.

          (3) The Congress concurs in the findings of the Comptroller
          General that most sweatshop employers violate the recordkeeping
          requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and that the
          failure of such employers to maintain adequate records has and
          continues to adversely affect the ability of the Department of
          Labor to collect wages due to workers.

          (4) The amendment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to
          provide for legal responsibility on the part of manufacturers for
          compliance with such Act's wage and hour, child labor, and
          industrial homework provisions by contractors in the garment
          industry and to provide civil penalties for violations of that
          A~t'S recordkeeping requirements is necessary to promote fair
          competition and working conditions that are not detrimental to
          the maintenance of health, efficiency, and general well-being of
          workers in the garment industry.

SEC. 3. LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH WAGE AND HOUR PROVISIONS
