Background on Kentucky Tobacco Farmers

      There are two main types of tobacco, flue-cured and burley. Burley tobacco is the
primary crop in Keptucky, with revenues of more than $800 million in 1997 for the nearly
450 million pounds grown. In 1997, approximately 70 percent of the burley tobacco
produced in the United States came from Kentucky. The majority of burley tobacco
producers in Kentucky favor continuation of the federal price support program.

       Many Kentucky tobacco farms are very small. The average Kentucky tobacco
farm plants only 4.5 acres of burley tobacco. In contrast, flue-cured tobacco farms in
North Carolina and South Carolina average 16.1 and 25.5 acres of tobacco per farm,
respectively. However, large farms dominate Kentucky's burley tobacco business. Last
year, 70 percent of the total burley sold came from only 26 percent of the farms.

        Tobacco is a major part of the Kentucky economy. Tobacco sales account for over
40 percent of the total crop revenue for Kentucky, and over 20 percent of all agricultural
sales in Kentucky.

       According to USDA, Kentucky experienced an abnormal year for their 1997 burley
tobacco crop. Adverse weather conditions resulted in tobacco with high moisture content
that was of a generally low quality and received a lower prices than expected.

Tobacco Program Background

         Since the 1930s, tobacco prices have been supported and stabilized by the federal
government's commodity support program. One part of USDA's program involves
limiting supply through a quota program. A quota entitles the owner to grow a certain
percentage of the national supply of tobacco for that year. Under the quota program, the
government estimates each year how much tobacco the companies expect to buy, how much
will be sold overseas plus a modest reserve, and then divides up the right to grow that full
amount among the quota holders. The burley quota can be sold, rented or leased. In
addition, the tobacco program guarantees an acceptable price at which farmers can sell
their tobacco. The price-support system ensures that farmers can sell tobacco at a
statutory minimum price to their cooperatives if companies cease to buy on the open
market or their bid price is too low. In this program, the government loans funds to the
cooperatives to purchase tobacco from farmers at a certain price (the "loan rate"), which
are repaid from the proceeds of future sales.

        Producers of the different kinds of tobacco vote in triennial referenda to determine
if they wish to continue the federal tobacco program for their kind of tobacco. In a
referendum in late February, 97.5 percent of burley producers voted to continue the price
support-production control program.

The AG's Settlement Agreement

        The settlement agreement with the Attorneys General did not outline a plan to
compensate farmers for the diminished domestic tobacco sales that might result from
comprehensive legislation. You, however, made protecting tobacco farmers and their
communities one of the five key elements of your plan for comprehensive tobacco
legislation.

Legislative Background

       Three types of legislative approaches for farmers have been discussed. First,
Senator Lugar proposed legislation that would quickly "buy-out" quota owners from the
governmental system at approximately $8 a pound. In Senator Lugar's plan, tobacco
prices and production levels would then be subject to the free market, and farmers would
not incur quota rental costs (of the 463,000 individuals who own quotas, 340,000 of them do
not grow tobacco). Second, Senator Ford proposed legislation that would maintain the
current quota system, while also compensating farmers (up to $8 per pound) for the
difference between the 1995-1997 average prices and the diminished prices they may
experience. Senator Ford's bill also includes transition funds for communities. Finally,
Senator Robb had proposed legislation that would combine elements of both of the above
approaches. He sought to buy-out farmers, but replace the quota system with a similar
production control system based on permits. Unlike quotas, permits would be given only
to those who actually grew tobacco and could not be bought or rented.

        Senator Ford's proposal, the LEAF Act, appealed mostly to burley growers like
those in Kentucky who have small farms and want to continue the quota program.
Senator Robb's approach gained some support from flue-cured farmers (based mainly in
North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia) who believe the buy-out and license system
better fits more capital-intensive flue-cured production, and who would like to eliminate
quota rental costs from their operating expenses. Senator Lugar's approach has not
attracted widespread support; even tobacco-state senators like McConnell who
philosophically favor this approach probably will not come out for it publicly, in part
because other legislation provides the same $8 per pound buyout with little other change in
the program.

Farmers' Legislation Included in McCain Tobacco Bill

        Senators Ford, Frist, and Hollings, the three members of the Senate Commerce
Committee from tobacco-growing states, joined together to include a generous farmer provision
in the McCain tobacco legislation. While maintaining a production control system for all
tobacco farmers, this package sets up somewhat different systems for burley and flue-cured
tobacco. For burley tobacco (grown mostly in Kentucky), the package includes an optional
buy-out for quota holders at $8 per pound, and retains the quota system for those who do not take
the buyout, but provides payments to both remaining quota holders, lessees, and tenants to the

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

extent that base quota declines. For flue-cured tobacco, the plan provides for a mandatory
buyout of existing quota holders, and replaces the quota system with apermit system that gives
the new no-cost permits to active producers, regardless of whether they previously held a quota.
This transferring of quotas from inactive quota holders to actual producers was part of the
Senator Robb's proposal and is intended to make it possible for active farmers to sell tobacco
without incurring the cost of buying or renting quota. The McCain package also provides
approximately $300 million annually for assistance to tobacco-producing communities. The
package costs $2.1 billion per year for the first ten years and $500 million for years 11-25 for a
total of $28.5 billion. For the most part, tobacco farmers are very pleased with the proposal
included in the McCain legislation.

        While the bill would provide over $20 billion to tobacco farmers and quota holders,
the actual lost revenue to them due to the legislation is estimated to be no more than $2
billion. For example, while the bill would buyout quota holders at $8 per pound, both
flue-cured and burley quotas sell today for less than $4 per pound. USDA estimates that
even without legislation or a change in the program, flue-cured tobacco production would
fall 39 percent by 2005 and 58 percent by 2009. The additional compensation in the bill
can be viewed as offsetting the long-term, downward trend of tobacco demand and
producer income that is independent of the bill.

Below is a table with the major provisions for tobacco farmers in the McCain legislation.

Other Provisions:

Tobacco Community Economic Development Grants: Block grants to tobacco states will be
made annually for rural business enterprise grants, farm ownership loans, initiatives which create
farm and off-farms employment, expanding infrastructure, facilities and services to diversify
the rural economy, long-term business technical assistance, supplemental agricultural activities,
value-added agricultural initiatives, and compensation to warehouse owners. The program is
authorized for $375 million. However, since USDA program costs would be paid out of
these funds, communities will likely receive around $300 million annually through 2008,
and $375 million 2009 to 2023. At least 20 percent of the funds must be spent on agricultural
activities, 4 percent on long-term technical assistance, and 6 percent on warehouse owners.

Benefits for Dislocated Workers: Up to $25 million annually for 10 years will be made
available to provide benefits based on the NAFT A displaced workers program, including
training and relocation expenses. This program will be administered by the Secretary of
Labor.

Farmer Opportunity Grants: Quota holders and active tobacco producers and their families are
eligible for higher education grants of up to $1,700 per academic year, adjusted upward every
five years by $300, for a total of $42.5 million through 2004 and gradually increasing after
that. Academic eligibility is modeled after Pell grants, and the program is administered by the
Secretary of Education.

Costs Incidental to the Program: All USDA costs associated with tobacco are paid out of a
tobacco growers trust fund, including administrative costs, crop insurance, cooperative extension
service costs, and any other costs (estimated to be around $60 million annually).
