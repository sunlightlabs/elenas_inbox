          links between schools and the work place, and challenging standards for learning.        Secretary

          emphasizing continuing education. Riley was elected governor in 1978, and reelected in 1982,
          after the people of South Carolina voted to amend the state constitution to enable Riley to be the
          first person in South Carolina history to run for a second term.
