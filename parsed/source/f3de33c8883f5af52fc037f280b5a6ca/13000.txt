Subject:         Cureton brief

I just received this draft of Justice's brief in the NCAA case (in which
the E.D. of Pennsylvania struck down the NCAA's use of the SAT as being
discriminatory under Title VI). Apparently, Justice and Education are in
agreement with the positions taken regarding:   (1) the existence of a
private right of action for a disparate impact claim under Title VI and
(2) the NCAA's liabililty under Title VI because it receives federal
financial assistance through another entity (the National Youth Sports
Program) or because it has been ceded controlling authority by a recipient
over a program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
However, there is some disagreement (see Anita Hodgkiss's note below)
about what position, if any, to take on the merits (i.e., whether the
court correctly applied the law to the facts in this case in finding the
NCAA violated Title VI) .

Anita said that Judy Winston and Norma did not want Justice to take a
position on the merits because it would hurt our efforts on issuing the
high-stakes testing guidance (this view isn't entirely clear to me, but it
may be that so much attention on the Title VI disparate impact regs may
invite Congressional meddling with them).  Steve Winnick of Judy's office
stated that their concern is that some portions of the record are under
seal and so that it is imprudent to take a position on the merits absent
complete knowledge of the facts.  With the exception of the sentence cited
in Anita's note, Justice has agreed not to address the merits in any
detail, but there is some concern there that the absence of support for
the merits will undermine the plaintiffs' argument.

The brief is due to be filed tomorrow.        If you have any questions or
comments on it, please call.

Attached is our draft.  The Department of Education was concerned about
the last sentence in the first paragraph of section 3 in the "Introduction
and Summary of Argument" (pp. 13-14 on my printed version).  We are all
in agreement that this section should be expanded to better explain the
legal standard that the court applied.  The brief must be filed tomorrow.
I
can explain in greater detail why this is so late if that's a question.

           BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
              SUPPORTING APPELLEES URGING AFFIRMANCE


                      STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES

     The United States will address the following issues:

     1.   Whether there is a private right of action for a claim of

discrimination based upon disparate impact under Title VI of the

Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et     ~.


     2.   Whether the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)

is subject to the requirements of Title VI because it either receives

federal financial assistance through another recipient or has been

ceded controlling authority by a recipient over a program or activity

receiving federal financial assistance.




                                              Automated Records Management System
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

               IDENTITY AND INTEREST OF THE AMICUS CURIAE

        The United States Department of Education extends financial

assistance to educational programs and activities and is authorized

by Congress to ensure compliance with Title VI, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1,

in the operation of those programs and activities.       Pursuant to that

authority, the Department of Education has issued regulations that

define a recipient, 34 C.F.R. 100.13(i), and regulations that

prohibit use of criteria for determining the type of services,

financial aid, or other benefits a recipient will provide that have

a disparate impact based upon race, 34 C. F. R. 100.3 (b) (2) .

        The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

provides federal financial assistance to the National Youth Sports

Program Fund, an entity that the district court found to be controlled

by the NCAA.     HHS has also issued a regulation defining a recipient

that tracks the definition in the regulation issued by the Department

of Education, 45 C.F.R. 80.13(i), and a regulation that prohibits

the use of criteria that have a disparate impact based upon race.

 45 C.F.R. 80.3 (b) (2).

        The United States Department of Justice coordinates enforcement

of Title VI by executive agencies.    Exec. Order No. 12,250, 28 C.F.R.

0.51.     The Department of Justice also has authority to enforce Title

VI in federal court upon a referral by an agency that extends federal

financial assistance to an education program or activity.

        This appeal presents the issue whether a private individual


                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

may file a judicial action to enforce agency regulations that prohibit

the use by recipients of federal financial assistance of criteria

or methods of administration that have a disparate impact based upon

race.     Because of the inherent limitations on administrative

enforcement mechanisms and on the litigation resources of the United

States, the United States has an interest in ensuring that both Title

VI and its implementing regulations may be enforced in federal court

by private parties acting as "private attorneys general."                Such

private suits are critical to ensuring optimal enforcement of the

mandate of Title VI and the regulations.      See Cannon v. University

of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 705-706 (1979) (permitting private citizens

to sue under Title VI is "fully consistent with -- and in some cases

even necessary to - - the orderly enforcement of the statute").               The

United States filed a brief as amicus curiae on that issue in Chester

Residents Concerned For Quality Living v. Seif, 132 F.3d 925                 (3d

Cir. 1997), vacated as moot, 119 S. Ct. 22 (1998); Powell v. Ridge,

No. 98-2096 (3d Cir.); and Sandoval v. Hagan, No. 98-6598 (11th Cir.).

        This appeal also presents the issue whether the NCAA is subj ect

to coverage under Title VI.    The United States filed a brief as amicus

curiae in National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith, 119

S. Ct. 924    (1999), which argued (at 19-20) that the NCAA could be

a recipient of federal financial assistance through a grant from

the Department of Health and Human Services, and (at 20-27)                that

it could be subject to coverage under Title IX of the Education

                                               Automated Records Management System
                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

Amendments of 1972,20 U.S.C. 1681,   et~,    without being a recipient

if it had been ceded control by a recipient over a program or activity

receiving federal financial assistance.!1     The district court has

held that the NCAA is subject to Title VI under both of those theories,

and this Court's resol ution of this issue could affect the enforcement

of Title VI by the United States.

                        STATEMENT OF THE CASE

     A.   Course Of Proceedings And Disposition Below

     In January 1997, plaintiffs Tai Kwan Cureton and Leatrice Shaw

filed a complaint individually and on behalf of a class of

African-American student-athletes claiming that the minimum

requirements of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)

for freshman students to compete in intercollegiate activities and

to receive athletic scholarships discriminate against them on the

basis of race in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of

1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, et   ~,     and its implementing regulations.

 Curetonv. National Collegiate Athletic Association, C.A. No. 97-131

(E.D. Pa.).

     The NCAA filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that

(1) disparate impact discrimination is not actionable under Title

VI or its implementing regulations;    (2) the NCAA is not a "program

or activity" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 2000d-4a; and (3) the


     11 The Supreme Court's decision did not address the validity
of either of these theories.   NCAA v. Smith, 119 S. Ct. at 930.

                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

NCAA is not subject to Title VI because it does not receive federal

financial assistance.    Plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss and

also filed a motion for partial summary judgment.         On October 9,

1997, the district court entered an order denying the NCAA's motion

to dismiss.   The court also granted plaintiffs' motion for partial

summary judgment, holding that there is a private right of action

under the Title VI regulations for a claim of discrimination based

upon disparate impact.    1997 WL 634376, at *2.    The district court

denied defendant's motion to certify t·he question for immediate

appeal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1292(b), stating that there is not

a substantial ground for difference of opinion in light of the

"overwhelming circuit law" supporting the reasoning of its decision.

 Cureton v. - - Civ. A. No. 97-131, 1998 WL 726653, at *1.
            NCAA, .                                                     (E.D.

Pa., Oct. 16, 1998).

     The October 9 order found that "the NCAA appears to be a program

or activity covered by Title VI" under the definition in 42 U.S.C.

2000d-4a (4) , but found that the record was not sufficiently developed

to determine whether the NCAA receives federal financial assistance.

 1997 WL 634376, at *2-*3.    The court therefore left that

determination to a trial on the merits.     Id. at *3.

     The NCAA thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment, and

plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the merits

of the alleged Title VI violation.     On March 8, 1999, the district

court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.

                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

      The NCAA filed a timely notice of appeal on March 17, 1999 (JA

1250a).    On April 8, 1999, plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal (JA

14l4a) .

      B.   Statement Of Facts

            1.   Background.

      The NCAA is a voluntary, unincorporated association of

approximately 1200 members, consisting of colleges and universities,

conferences and associations, and other educational institutions.

 Cureton v. NCAA, 37 F. Supp.2d 687, 690 (3d Cir. 1999).            The NCAA

is responsible for promulgating rules governing all aspects of

intercollegiate athletics, including recruiting, eligibility of

student-athletes, and academic standards.    Its member institutions

agree to abide by and enforce those rules.     Id. at 695 & n.6.            The

four-year colleges and universities that are the active members of

the NCAA are divided into Divisions I, II, and III.          Id. at 690.

Some bylaws of the NCAA are applicable to all divisions.             Each

division may, however, adopt additional bylaws applicable only to

that division.    This case involves a bylaw that is applicable only

to Division I schools.     Ibid.

       In response to public perception that student athletes were

inadequately prepared to succeed academically and to receive an

undergraduate degree, the Division I membership adopted requirements

for high school graduates seeking to participate in athletics and

to receive athletically-related financial assistance during their

                                             Automated Records Management System
                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

freshman year.       Proposition 48, which was implemented during the

1986-1987 academic year, required high school graduates to have a

2.0 GPA in 11 core academic courses and a minimum score of 700 on

the SAT (or a composite score of 15 on the ACT) in order to participate

in freshman intercollegiate athletics.       37 F. Supp.2d at 690.

     In 1992, these initial eligibility rules were modified through

the adoption of Proposition 16.       As fully implemented effective

August 1, 1996, Proposition 16 increased the number of core courses

required to 13 and introduced an initial eligibility index.               Under

the index, a student-athlete could establish eligibility with a GPA

of 2.0 only if combined with an SAT score of 1010 (or an ACT sum

score of 86) .!/     A student with a GPA of 2.5 or higher was required

to have an SAT score of 820 (or an ACT sum score of 68).            Since the

core GPA cutoff score of 2.0 is two standard deviations below the

national mean, while the SAT/ACT cutoff score is only one standard

deviation below the national mean, Proposition 16 results in a

"heavier weighting of the standardized test."       37 F. Supp.2d at 691.



           2.      Federal financial assistance




     y In 1995, the College Board recentered the score scales for
the SAT. After recentering, a test score of 700 on the old scale
is approximately equivalent to a score of 830 on the recentered scale.

      In 1969, the NCAA began receiving federal financial assistance

for the operation of the National Youth Sports Program (NYSP) .!/

 From that time until 1991, the NCAA was a direct recipient of federal

financial assistance from the Department of HHS to operate the NYSP

(JA 145a-146a; JA 511a-516a).       On October 3, 1989, the NCAA created

the NYSP Foundation as a nonprofit corporation under the laws of

Missouri   (JA 506a-509a).     It was later renamed the NYSP fund (see

JA 147a, Marshall 7/2/97 Dep. at 29-30).         The Fund was created "to

insure that    [the NCAA]   is not a recipient or a contractor of the

federal government"     (JA 147a-148a, Marshall 7/2/97 Dep: at 31-33) .

 On August 9, 1991, Edward Thiebe, the Director of Youth Sports for

the NCAA, sent a letter to HHS requesting that its Fiscal Year 1991

grant application for the NYSP be amended to designate the NYSP Fund

as the grantee (JA 151a-152a).      From 1992 to the present, the federal

grant has been made to the NYSP Fund.      In Fiscal Year 1996, the federal

grant from HHS was $11,520,000 (JA 74a, see also JA 261a (HHS press

release announcing that "$11,520,000 was awarded to the NCAA")).




     J! Through subgrantees, the NYSP offers sports instruction and
instruction in life skills, science, and math to poor and
disadvantaged youths (JA 520a) .

                                                     Hex.Dwnp Conversion

     Nonetheless,   "Guidelines for the 1993 National Youth Sports

Program," which are prepared by the NYSP Committee as a required

part of the grant application process, listed the NCAA, not the Fund,

as the grantee of the HHS grant (JA 254a-259a; see Marshall 6/30/97

Dep. at 28-30).   -The guidelines stated that "[t]he NCAA has been

awarded a grant by the [Office of Community Services]" of HHS (JA

258a).   The guideliness also stated that a "specified amount of funds

shall be made available to participating institutions through the

National Collegiate Athletic Association to conduct projects"                (JA

257a) and invited applications to be submitted to the NCAA at its

office address in Overland, Kansas     (ibid.) .ll

     Pursuant to its Bylaws, the Fund has four directors, three of

whom are NCAA officers or employees (JA 229a) .ll         The Fund itself

has no offices, no employees, and no letterhead (JA 143a, JA 161a,

Marshall 7/2/97 Dep. at 13, 85; JA 196a, Thiebe Dep. at 44).                The

Fund has never had a Board of Directors meeting, but rather has

"handled any business that needed to be taken care of through * *

* consent minutes" (JA 158a).   The Fund's bank account is entitled:

 "The National Collegiate Athletic Association - - The National Youth


     11 In a document dated 2/3/95 that was attached to one of its
own pleadings in the district court, the NCAA is listed as the
"Applicant organization" for the NYSP grant (JA310a - Assurances
given in connection with grant) .

Executive Director of the NCAA, and the chairperson of the NYSP

Sports Program"        (JA 505a).   The staff of the NCAA, as well as the

fund, has authority to draw from the federal government's grant

through that account (JA 156a-157a, Marshall 7/2/97 Dep. at 68-69) .

      Through 1994, the NCAA,        "d/b/a the National Youth Sports

Program," was the named insured on liability policies covering the

activities of the NYSP (JA 526a-629a) .!!          The Fund's Articles of

Incorporation provide that upon the dissolution of the Fund, the

assets of the Fund shall be distributed exclusively to the NCAA,

provided the NCAA continues to be an education organization within

the meaning of     §   501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code (JA 508a).

      Perhaps most important, it is the NCAA's NYSP committee, and

not the Fund, that makes all of the decisions about the NYSP and

the use of the federal funds.         For example, the NYSP committee has

final approval over which colleges and universities receive subgrants

to operate the NYSP's instructional and educational programs (JA

200a).   The NCAA stipulated that once the NCAA's NYSP committee makes

a decision, no further action is required to implement that decision

(JA 209a-210a) .

      The NCAA's Executive Director has stated that" [tlhe NYSP is

one of the NCAA's best-kept secrets, yet it is consistently one of

our most successful and influential programs.           Our partnership with


        & In the NCAA's 1995-1996 Annual Report, the Fund is included

the NCAA Foundation is described in the Annual Report as "a separate
legal entity" not included in the NCAA's financial statements (JA

colleges and universities perfectly embodies the NCAA's team spirit"

(JA 263a) .

       C.    The Decision Below

       In granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs, the district

court held that the NCAA is subject to Title VI, and that Proposition

16 violates the disparate impact        p~ohibition   of the Title VI

regulations.         The court's earlier partial grant of summary judgment

held that plaintiffs have a private right of action to enforce the

Title VI regulation prohibiting disparate impact discrimination (see

page        , supra).

               1.    Coverage of NCAA under Title VI.

       Plaintiffs raised several theories under which the NCAA would

be subj ect to Ti tle VI.     First, they contended that the NCAA receives

federal financial assistance indirectly through the receipt of dues

from its member schools, all of whom receive federal financial

assistance.         The district court rejected that theory based upon the

Supreme Court's decision in NCAA v. Smith, 119 S. Ct. 924                 (1999).

 37 F. Supp.2d at 693.

       Plaintiffs also argued that the NCAA directly receives federal

financial assistance through the National Youth Sports Program Fund

because the Fund is nothing more than the alter ego of the NCAA.

The district court found that plaintiffs "failed to sustain their

heavy burden of 'piercing the corporate veil' sufficient to have

                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

the Fund construed as the NCAA's alter ego."    37 F. Supp.2d at 694.

 However, the court found "overwhelming evidence" supporting the

fact that "the Fund is ultimately being controlled by the NCAA,"

ibid., and thus concluded that plaintiffs had sustained their burden

of proving that the NCAA "exercises effective control and operation

of the" grant given by HHS to the Fund "to be construed as an indirect

recipient of federal financial assistance."    Ibid.    The court found

that "although the Fund is the named recipient of the block grant,

it is merely a conduit through which the NCAA makes all of the

decisions about the Fund and the use of the federal funds."           Ibid.



     Finally, the court found that plaintiffs also proved that the

NCAA is subject to suit under Title VI regardless of whether it

receives federal financial assistance, "because member schools (who

themselves indisputably receive federal funds)    have ceded

controlling authority over federally funded programs to the NCAA."

 37 F. Supp.2d at 694.   It found that the "member colleges and

universities have granted to the NCAA the authority to promulgate

rules affecting intercollegiate athletics that the members are

obligated to abide by and enforce."     Id. at 696.    Accordingly,

"because there is a nexus between the NCAA's allegedly discriminatory

conduct with regards to intercollegiate athletics and the sponsorship

of such programs by federal fund recipients, the NCAA is subject

to Title VI for a challenge to Proposition 16."        Ibid.

     2.    The decision on the merits

     The district court held that the disparate impact standard

developed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.

2000e et   ~,    in the employment context is applicable to a claim

of disparate impact in educational testing.         37 F. Supp.2d at

696-697.    Applying that standard, the court held that          P~oposition


16 causes a racially disproportionate effect on African-Americans

(id. at 697-701); that Proposition 16 is not justified by any

legitimate educational necessity (id. at 701-712); and that, in any

event, plaintiffs had demonstrated that there are equally effective

alternative practices to Proposition 16 having less adverse effect

upon African-Americans (id. at 713-714).        Accordingly, the court

granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment (id. at 714) .

                INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

     1.    This Court in Chester Residents Concerned For Quality Living

v. Seif, 132 F.3d 925 (1997), vacated as moot, 119 S. Ct. 22 (1998),

correctly held that "private plaintiffs may maintain an action under

discriminatory effect regulations promulgated by federal

administrative agencies pursuant to section 602 of Title VI of the

Civil Rights Act of 1964," and that decision should be reinstated

as the law in this Circuit.     The reasoning of Chester Residents is

still persuasive authority.     See Polychrome Int'l Corp. v. Krigger,

5 F.3d 1522, 1534 (3d Cir. 1993); Finberg v. Sullivan, 658 F.2d 93,

100 n.14 (3d Cir. 1981)   (en banc).     Moreover, the holding in Chester

Residents was consistent with that of every other court of appeals

to consider the issue.    l32 F.3d at 936-937.        The NCAA has presented

no "compelling basis" for this Court to disregard that holding.

Wagner v. PennWest Farm Credit, ACA, 109 F. 3d 909, 912 (3d Cir. 1997) .



      2.   In Part II, we argue that the NCAA is subject to coverage

under Title VI both because it receives federal financial assistance

indirectly through the NSYP Fund, which it controls, and because it

has been conceded controlling authority over the intercollegiate

athletics programs of its member colleges and universities, which

receive federal financial assistance directly.

      3.   With respect to the district court's ruling that the minimum

.standardized test score cutoff in Proposition 16 violates Title VI

of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court correctly held (37 F. Supp.

2d at 696-697) -- and the NCAA does not dispute -- that the disparate

impact standards developed in employment discrimination cases under

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seg.)

apply to claims brought pursuant to the regulations implementing Title

VI.   See, e.g., Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v.

Georgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1417 (11th Cir. 1985) i NAACP v. Medical Center,

Inc., 657 F.2d l322, l331 (3d Cir. 1981)    i    Larry P. v. Riles, 793 F.2d

969, 982 nn.9-10   (9th Cir. 1984).      Thus,    if the facts relied upon

in the district court's rulings    (which are based in large measure

on the NCAA's own studies) are right, it would appear that the district


                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

court correctly held that Proposition 16's cutoff score violates the

effects test of the Title VI regulation.!/

     We do not take a position on the factual questions raised in

this appeal.   Because parts of the record relating to this issue

remain under seal   (see NCAA Br. at 8 n.3), we have not had access

to the information necessary to ascertain whether the district court

correctly determined that Proposition 16's cutoff score causes a

racially disproportionate effect; that the NCAA had not demonstrated

that the cutoff score significantly serves the goal of raising

student-athlete graduation rates; and that,   in any event, the

plaintiffs established the existence of alternative practices that

serve the goal of raising student-athlete graduation rates and that

have less of an adverse impact upon African-Americans.          These are

     v  The district court mentioned, but did not apply to Title
VI, the 1991 amendments to Title VII that require a defendant to
bear both a burden of production and persuasion on its business
necessity justification.    37 F. Supp. 2d at 697.   See 42 U.S.C.
2000e(m), 2000e-2k(1) (A).   Although the alleged discrimination in
this case occurred after 1991, the court appears to have applied
the previous standard, set out in Wards Cove Packing Co.   v. Atonio,
490 U.S. 642 (1989), that the defendant bears only a burden of
producing evidence that the challenged employment practice has a
legitimate business justification.    If this Court agrees with the
district court's ruling that the NCAA failed to meet its burden under
Wards Cove because it "has not produced any evidence demonstrating
that the cutoff score used in Proposition 16 serves, in a significant
way, the goal of raising student-athlete graduation rates" (37 F.
Supp. at 712), it will be unnecessary for the Court to determine
whether the district court erred in failing to require the NCAA to
satisfy the heavier burden imposed by the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
 Cf. Elston v. Talladega County Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d 1394, 1407
n.14 (11th Cir. 1993).   In any event, this Court should not resolve
this important issue without the benefit of full briefing from the
parties (see NCAA Br. at 47 n.19, Cureton Br. at 36 n.19).

                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

highly fact-bound determinations, and we believe the parties are in

the best position to assist the Court in determining whether the

district court erred in any of these rulings.

                               ARGUMENT

                                   I

     PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS MAY SUE TO ENFORCE THE DISPARATE IMPACT
     STANDARD IN AGENCY REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING TITLE VI

     Plaintiffs sought to enforce regulations of the Departments of

Education and Health and Human Services promulgated under Section

602 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.

2000d-1 (JA 28a).   Those regulations prohibit a recipient of federal

financial assistance from using "criteria or methods of

administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to

discrimination because of their race."        34 C.F.R. 100.3 (b) (2) i 45

C.F.R. 80.3 (b) (2) (emphasis added).    This Court in Chester Residents

Concerned For Quality Living v. Seif, 132 F.3d 925 (1997), vacated

as moot, 119 S. Ct. 22   (1998), held that "private plaintiffs may

maintain an action under discriminatory effect regulations

promulgated by federal administrative agencies pursuant to section

602 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."           Although that

decision is no longer binding circuit precedent, the opinion in

Chester Residents retains its persuasive authority.           See Polychrome

Int'l Corp. v. Krigger, 5 F.3d 1522, 1534 (3d Cir. 1993) i Finberg

v. Sullivan, 658 F.2d 93, 100 n.14       (3d Cir. 1981)    (en banc)      ("Even

if a decision is vacated, however, the force of its reasoning remains,

                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

and the opinion of the Court may influence resolution of future

disputes.").    In addition, the holding in Chester Residents was

consistent with that of every other court of appeals to consider the

issue.   132 F.3d at 936-937 (collecting cases from the First, Second,

Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits).             This Court

has noted that" [i] n light of such an array of precedent,          [it] would

require a compelling basis to hold otherwise before effecting a

circuit split."    Wagnerv. PennWest Farm Credit, ACA, 109 F.3d 909,

912   (3d Cir. 1997).

      The NCAA has provided no such "compelling basis."            All of the

arguments raised by the NCAA (Br. 17-25) were correctly rejected by

the panel in Chester Residents and should likewise be rejected here.

 First, the NCAA (Br. 18-20) attacks the district court's decision

for relying on an overly broad reading of Guardians.            The district

court, however, issued its decision concluding that there is a private

right of action to enforce the Title VI regulations in October 1997,

some two months before the decision in Chester Residents.            Thus, its

conclusion that the Supreme Court in Guardians had resolved the issue

could not have anticipated this Court's conclusion in Chester

Residents that Guardians is not dispositive, 132 F.3d at 930, and

that the Supreme Court's decision in Alexander v. Choate provided

"no direct authority    * * * that either confirms or denies the existence
of a private right of action," 132 F.3d at 931.          In any event, the

district court's holding that there is a private right of action to


                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

enforce the disparate impact regulation is, of course, entirely

consistent with this Court's Chester Residents holding.

     Second, the NCAA argues (Br. 20-23) that Section 602 does not

permit an implied private right of action, in part because Section

602 "prohibits any enforcement of the regulations" until the federal

funding agency gives the alleged violator notice and an opportunity

to comply voluntarily (Br. 22, emphasis in original).          But, as the

Court noted in Chester Residents, 132 F.3d at 935, "a private lawsuit

also affords a fund recipient similar notice."      Moreover,· the

requirements of Section 602 "were designed to cushion the blow of

a result that private plaintiffs cannot effectuate," i.e.,

termination of funding.   Id. at 936.   The Court in Chester Residents

therefore properly found that "a private right of action would be

consistent with the legislative scheme of Title VI."          Ibid.     In

addition, if the NCAA were correct in its reading of the statute,

then a private right of action to enforce the prohibition on

intentional discrimination (which the federal government also

enforces through the procedures established in Section 602) would

also be barred, a result clearly foreclosed by the Supreme Court's

decision in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677           (1979).

     Finally, the NCAA argues (Br. 23-25) that the legislative history

of Title VI does not support the implication of a private right of

action for unintentional discrimination.     It attempts to diminish

the import of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Restoration


                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28 (1988), discussed by

this Court in Chester Residents, noting (NCAA Br. at 24) that Chester

Residents relied on comments from opponents of the 1987 legislation

that "do not shed light on the purpose or intent behind Title VI./I

    But Chester Residents was following the well-accepted rule that when

there is evidence that Congress understands that a private right of

action was available under a statutory scheme, and amends the statute

without demonstrating any intent to disapprove of such suits, it has

ratified that private right of action.       See Herman & MacLean v.

Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 386 (1983); Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner

&   Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 381-382 (1982); see also Cannon,

441 U.S. at 687 n.7; Lindahl v. OPM, 470 U.S. 768, 787-788             (1985)

    And while much of the discussion of private enforcement of the

discriminatory effects regulations came from opponents to the bill,

"they are nevertheless relevant and useful, especially where, as here,

the proponents of the bill made no response./I    Arizona v. California,

373 U.S. 546, 583 n.85     (1963).

        The NCAA has not articulated a compelling basis for this Court

to discard the holding of Chester Residents and reject the result

reached by the other circuits that have addressed the question.            This

Court should reinstate the holding of Chester Residents here.!/


     ~ By the time this Court considers the issue whether there is
a private right of action to enforce the disparate impact regulations
under Title VI in this case, the issue may have been resolved by
the panel in Powell v. Ridge, No. 98-2096 (3d Cir.), in which oral
argument was held on June 9, 1999.     The panel in Powell, however,

does not need to reach that issue if it decides that the Title VI
discriminatory effect regulations may be enforced through 42 U. S. C.
1983.


                                               Automated Records Management System
                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

      The regulations of the Departments of Education and HHS define

a recipient of federal financial assistance as any entity "to whom

Federal financial assistance is extended directly or through another

recipient, for any program" (34 C.F.R. 100.13 (i)     i    45 C.F.R. 80.13 (i)).

 From 1969 through 1991, the NCAA directly received federal financial

assistance for the NYSP in its own name.        After passage of the Civil

Rights Restoration Act, the NCAA named the NYSP Fund to be the grant

recipient for federal funding in order "to insure that              [the NCAA]

is not a recipient or a contractor of the federal government"               (JA

147a-148a, Marshall 7/2/97 Dep at 31-33).         The evidence relied upon

by the district court, some of which is recited at pp.                 , supra,

demonstrates, however, that the incorporation of the NYSP Fund was

largely a formality and that the NCAA itself, through the NYSP

Committee, continues to administer the grant program.             The NYSP Fund

as the listed grantee is itself a direct recipient of federal financial

assistance subject to coverage under Title VI.            But the NCAA receives

federal financial assistance indirectly through its continued control

of the NYSP grant, notwithstanding its attempt to distance itself

from federal oversight. l /    Indeed, the Department of HHS has on two


     21 The NCAA's assertion (Br. 32) that "there is no evidence
to suggest that the NCAA has diverted any federal funds to its own
coffers" is beside the point.   A recipient of federal financial
assistance is required by law to use that assistance to fulfill the
ultimate purpose of the grant, and there is no allegation here that
the NCAA has not done so.   The claim here is not that the NCAA has
violated the law by setting up the NYSP Fund as the named grantee,
but rather that it cannot escape responsibility under Title VI if
it controls the administration of the grant.

occasions (in 1994 and 1998) taken the position that the NCAA is a

recipient of federal financial assistance through a Community

Development Block Grant from HHS and has accepted complaints of

discrimination for investigation (JA 1257a-1261a) .

        Based upon the "overwhelming evidence," 37 F. Supp.2d at 694,

the district court properly found that "the Fund is ultimately being

controlled by the NCAA," and thus that the NCAA is the indirect

recipient of federal financial assistance through the NYSP Fund.

Ibid.

        B.   The NCAA Is Subject To Title VI Because It Has Been
             Ceded Controlling Authority Over The Intercollegiate
             Athletic Programs Of Its Member Colleges And
             Universities, Which Receive Federal Financial
             Assistance.

        The district court found that "the NCAA is subject to suit

under Title VI irrespective of whether it receives federal funds,

directly or indirectly, because member schools (who themselves

indisputably receive federal funds) have ceded controlling authority

over federally funded programs to the NCAA."             37 F.3d at 694.

Although the district court did not articulate the statutory basis

for this theory of coverage, the United States believes that it is

firmly rooted in the text of Title VI.

        Title VI proves in relevant part that" [nl   0   person in the United

States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be

excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be

subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving


                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

Federal financial assistance."    42 U.S.C. 2000d.    As that statutory

text makes clear, Title VI, like Title IX of the Education Amendments

of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681(a), was not drafted "simply as a ban on

discriminatory conduct by recipients of federal funds."           Cannon v.

University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 691-692 (1979) i see Chowdhury

v. Reading Hospital and Medical Center, 677 F.2d 317, 318 & n.2 (3d

Cir. 1982)   (language of Cannon applicable to Title VI).          Instead,

the "unmistakable focus" of the statutory text is on the protection

of "the benefitted class."    Id. at 691.   The text itself does not

specifically identify the class of potential violators.           But given

the focus of the text on protection for the individual, and the absence

of any language limiting the ·class of violators to recipients, Title

VI is most naturally read as prohibiting any entity that has governing

authority over a program from subjecting an individual to race-based

discrimination under it.!/

     Although recipients are the principal class of entities that

may subject an individual to discrimination under a program, they


     ~I Congress has constitutional authority to reach the conduct
of anyone who threatens "the integrity and proper operation of [al
federal program."   See Salinas v. United States, 118 S. Ct. 469,
475 (1997) (upholding constitutionality of a statute that prohibits
the acceptance of bribes by employees of state and local agencies
that receive federal funds, as applied to a case in which a county
received funds for the operation of a j ail and the sheriff and deputy
sheriff at the jail accepted bribes in violation of the statute) .
 Since the NCAA's actions, if discriminatory, pose a threat to the
integrity and proper operation of the federally assisted programs
at member schools, Congress had constitutional authority to subject
the NCAA to liability for such discrimination.

                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

are not the only ones.     When a recipient cedes governing authority

over a program receiving assistance to another entity, and that entity

subjects an individual to discrimination under the program, that

entity violates Title VI, regardless of whether it is a recipient

itself.

       That commonsense reading of Title VI furthers its central

purposes -- "to avoid the use of federal resources to support

discriminatory practices" and to "provide individual citizens

effective protection against those practices."     Cannon, 441 U.S. at

704.    Several considerations support that conclusion.      First, as the

district court recognized, 37 F. Supp.2d at 695, intercollegiate

athletics is unique in that it is "one of the few educational programs

of a college or university that cannot be conducted without the

creation of   ~   separate entity to provide governance and

administration."     Out of the necessity for a supervising authority

comes the NCAA's power to establish the rules, such as Proposition

16, governing eligibility for intercollegiate athletics at member

schools.    "By joining the NCAA, each member agrees to abide by and

to enforce such rules."    NCAA v. Tarkanian, 488 U.S. 179, 183 (1988).

 Because the NCAA has effective control over eligibility

determinations for intercollegiate athletics, it is the entity most

responsible for any discrimination that enters into those

determinations.

       If there is discrimination in the NCAA's rules, a member school

may attempt to persuade the NCAA to change the rules, but if it is

unsuccessful, its only option is to withdraw from the NCAA.            Since

the NCAA has a virtual monopoly on intercollegiate athletics, a school

that has withdrawn from the NCAA in order to satisfy its own Title

VI obligations could no longer offer intercollegiate athletic

opportunities to its students.     That would leave victims of

discrimination without an effective remedy and deprive innocent third

parties of intercollegiate athletic opportunities as well.            Those

harsh consequences may be avoided if victims of the NCAA's

discrimination may seek relief against the NCAA directly.

     Firially, because of its unique power over intercollegiate

athletics, discrimination by the NCAA in the promulgation of its rules

has the capacity to result in discrimination at numerous member

schools simultaneously.   Permitting a private right of action against

the NCAA provides a mechanism for stopping discrimination at its

source before it becomes entrenched at member schools.!/




     ill A member school, of course, remains liable for any
discriminatory decision of the NCAA that it implements.       For the
reasons discussed above, however, when the NCAA is the source of
the discrimination and uses its power over member schools to implement
that discrimination, a remedy against the NCAA is more appropriate
and efficacious than a remedy against member schools.

      Permitting a judicial cause of action against the NCAA is

consistent with the principle that entities should not be subjected

to liability under Title VI without adequate notice.        See Gebser v.

Lago Vista Indep. School Dist., 118 S. Ct. 1989, 1997-1999 (1998).

 Unlike the situation in Gebser, plaintiffs do not seek to hold the

NCAA liable for discrimination committed by others; rather,

plaintiffs seek to hold the NCAA liable for its own alleged

discrimination in the promulgation and continued use of Proposition

16.   The text of the Title VI regulations provides sufficient notice

to the NCAA that it had an obligation not to use its authority over

an education program receiving federal assistance to subject an

individual to race-based discrimination under that program.!/

      I f the NCAA did not wish to subject itself to Title VI obligations

on the basis of its relationship to member institutions that receive

assistance, it could have refrained from exercising governing

authority over intercollegiate athletics at those institutions.

Once the NCAA assumed that governing role,      it also assumed an

obligation not to use that authority to discriminate on the basis

of race against individuals seeking access to intercollegiate

athletic programs at those institutions.

      The NCAA argues (Br. 38-39) that it cannot be subject to Title


     - Moreover, t h"

only, and not money damages, and so many of the "notice" concerns
that played a particularly significant role in Gebser are not so
compelling in this context.

VI coverage because it did not assume a contractual commitment not

to discriminate.       The text of Title VI, however, is not framed

exclusively in contract terms, and a contractual commitment not to

discriminate is not a precondition to application of the statute.

     If a contract analogy were needed, the relevant one would be

to the tort of intentional interference with a contract.        Restatement

of Torts,   §   766 (one who intentionally and improperly interferes with

the performance of a contract between another and a third person by

inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the

contract is subject to liability to the other).      When an entity that

has been ceded controlling authority over a recipient requires the

recipient to act in a discriminatory manner by, for example, imposing

a discriminatory requirement for eligibility, it effectively causes

the recipient to breach its agreement with the federal funding agency.

 Moreover, when an entity created by recipients makes and enforces

rules for recipients, it is on ample notice that it cannot do so in

a way that subj ects an individual to discrimination under the programs

of the recipients.

     Finally, contrary to the NCAA's contention (Br. 37-39)

subjecting non-recipients that have been ceded controlling authority

over federally assisted programs to coverage under Title VI is not

in conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in United States

Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans, 477 U.S. 597

(1986).     There are statements in that opinion that support the NCAA's


                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

argument that federal funding statutes like Title VI apply only to

recipients of federal financial assistance.      477 U.S. at 605-606.

 The context of those statements makes clear, however, that the Court

was addressing only whether coverage should extend past recipients

to beneficiaries.   The Court did not purport to address the entirely

different question whether an entity that has been ceded controlling

authority over a program receiving federal assistance violates Title

VI when it subjects an individual to discrimination under that

program.   Because the airlines did not have controlling authority

over the federally assisted airport programs, the question at issue

here was simply not presented in Paralyzed Veterans.

      Equally important, the Court's crucial concern in Paralyzed

Veterans was that expanding the funding statues to reach beneficiaries

of federal assistance would have resulted in "almost limitless

coverage" - - a result that was clearly at odds with Congress's intent.

 477 U.S. at 608-609.   The situation here is fundamentally different.

 The class of non-recipients that has governing authority over

programs receiving assistance is limited, and permitting a private

right of acting against such entities when they subject persons to

discrimination under those programs advances the purposes of Title

VI.

                              CONCLUSION

      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment should be affirmed

insofar as it (1) permits plaintiffs to bring an action to enforce

the Title VI disparate impact regulations and (2)      finds

that the NCAA is subject to Title VI coverage.      Since the district

court properly determined that the disparate impact standards

developed in employment discrimination cases under Title VII of the

Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et   ~.)      apply to claims

brought pursuant to the regulations implementing Title VI, the

judgment should also be affirmed if the facts relied upon in the

district court's rulings are correct
