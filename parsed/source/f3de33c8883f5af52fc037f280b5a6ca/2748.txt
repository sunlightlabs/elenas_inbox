TEXT:
Here's an agenda for tomorrow.  There's not too much to it.  I put some
unanswered semi-technical questions at the bottom that you can drop if you
want to.

 I'll both attach it and reprint it.

OPTIONS

 Exempt from FLSA and/or related labor protection laws (doesnD,t help
states meet minimum wage)

 Allow states to count other benefits toward the minimum wage:

 Medicaid
 child care
 housing
 transportation

 Weaken work requirements by allowing states to meet more of the work
requirements through education or training

 Exempt workfare from FICA/EITC, if necessary

 Other options?


Related Questions to answer:
 Does the Ways and Means proposal permit states to count training toward
the minimum wage only after they have exhausted the other device for
meeting the minimum wage (counting other benefits)?
 Does the Ways and Means proposal remove protections for race, gender,
disability discrimination?
 How easy is it for states to meet the 30 hour work requirement via
training?
