The Honorable Albert Gore, Jr.
President of the Senate
Washington D.C.   20510

Dear Mr. President:

Enclosed for the consideration of the Congress is a bill entitled
the "Hazard Reporting Protection Act of 1999."   Its purpose is to
enhance protections for employees who report workplace hazards to
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).   These
whistleblower protections are intended to protect an employee from
discrimination or discharge from his or her position based on
reporting an injury, illness or unsafe condition.

On April 28, 1998, Charles Jeffress, Assistant Secretary for OSHA,
testified before the u.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on
Workforce Protections regarding amendments to the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970 (aSH Act). Assistant Secretary
Jeffress emphasized that one way to strengthen protections for
workers would be to increase the protections under section 11(c)
of the Act.  He testified that under the current protections, the
Inspector General of the Department of Labor found that
"whistleblowers" often face retaliation for exposing unsafe or
unhealthy conditions. He has pointed out that in its current state,
the provisions in section 11(c) are too weak and too cumbersome to
provide effective protections for workers.   Today, I propose that
the aSH Act be amended to reflect these concerns.

Support for strengthening section 11 (c) can be traced back to a report
of the Administrative Conference of the United States in 1987.
Secretaries of Labor Ann McLaughlin, Elizabeth Dole and Robert Reich
each stated their support for increasing the statutory safeguards
for employee whistleblowers.   Efforts to pass legislation amending
whistleblower protections have been attempted since the 101 st
Congress.   It is time that affirmative steps are taken to correct
a problem that has been apparent for over a decade.

The amendment to section 11(c) is an effort to bring. aSH Act
protections to the levels afforded by other federal statutes such
as 49 U.S.C. 31105, the whistleblower provisions of the Surface
Transportation Assistance Act (STAA), the Federal Whistleblowers
Protection Act of 1989, and the Mine Safety and Health Act.   If
employees cannot be protected against retaliation, they will not
feel free to bring hazards to the attention of management or
violations of the law to the attention of OSHA.  Effective
whistleblower protections are essential to the kind of employee
involvement the nation needs to make continued improvement in the
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

safety and health of our workplaces.

The mission of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
is to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men
and women.  It is under this charge that the proposed amendment to
section 11(c) of the OSH Act is presented to Congress.


                         Sincerely,



                         Alexis M. Herman

                              SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS



Section (1) sets forth the title of the Act as the "Hazard Reporting Protection Act of 1999."



Section (2) amends § 11 (c)( 1) the OSH Act to clarify that employees cannot be discriminated

against for reporting any "injury, illness or unsafe condition."



Section (3) replaces § 11 (c)(2) with a prohibition against discriminating against an employee who

refuses to work in what he reasonably believes is a condition that poses a serious danger of injury

or impairment of health. This protection applies when the employee, where possible, has

communicated to his employer the perceived danger.



Section (4) amends the procedures for seeking a remedy under § 11(c) by striking paragraph (3)

and increasing from 30 to 180 days the time an employee has to file a complaint with the

Secretary. Section (4)(4)(A) retains the 90-day time frame for the Secretary to complete an

investigation and provides that, if after investigation, the Secretary finds reasonable cause to

believe the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee, the investigative findings

and a preliminary order reinstating the employee will be issued. The employer has 30 days to

file objections to the findings and request a hearing. If a hearing is not requested within 30 days,

the order becomes binding and is not subject to judicial review.

and adjudication under this provision.
