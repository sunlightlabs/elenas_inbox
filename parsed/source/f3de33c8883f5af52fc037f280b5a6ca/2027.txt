              u.s. Sentencing Commission Report on Crack Cocaine
                                        April 29, 1997

Announcement
    Today, the President released a statement commending the U.S. Sentencing Commission
     for moving forward with recommendations to reduce the disparity between crack and
     powder cocaine penalties. The President directed Director McCaffrey and Attorney
     General Reno to review the Sentencing Commission's specific recommendations and
     report back to him in 45 days.

Background
     Current federal law requires a 5-year mandatory sentence for 500 grams of powder
      cocaine, but imposes the same sentence for only 5 grams of crack cocaine -- a 100 to 1
      ratio.

.     The 1994 Crime Bill directed the Sentencing Commission to issue a report and
       recommendations on cocaine and federal sentencing policy. On May 1, 1995 the
       Commission sent to Congress proposed sentencing changes to equalize penalties at the
       powder cocaine level -- substantially reducing the penalties for crack cocaine possession
       and distribution. The Commission also proposed reducing money laundering sentences.
       President Clinton signed legislation which rejected these recommendations and directed
       the Commission to undertake additional review and submit new recommendations.

      Today's report by the Commission recommends that the triggering amount for the 5-year
       mandatory minimum for crack increase from the current 5 grams to between 25 and 75
       grams, and decrease for powder from the current 500 grams to between 125 and 375
       grams. If these recommendations become law, the resulting rations would range
       between 15 to 1 and 1.66 to 1.

      The President has stated before that some adjustment to the penalties for crack and
       powder cocaine is warranted. Such an adjustment would ensure that federal resources
       target mid- and high-level drug traffickers. However, he believes that any revision to the
       sentencing laws must continue to reflect that crack is a more dangerous form of cocaine
       and that tougher sentences are appropriate for more dangerous offenders. That is why
       his 1994 Crime Bill included an exception to the mandatory minimum drug penalties --
       the "safety valve" -- for certain first-time, non-violent, low-level drug offenders.

Clinton Administration: Fighting Cocaine and Emerging Drugs
      President Clinton has submitted the largest anti-drug budget to Congress. Overall drug
       use in the United States has fallen dramatically-- by half in 15 years. Between 1985 to
       1995, the number of current cocaine users dropped by 74%.

      Last year, the President signed his methamphetamine legislation into law. That law
       attacks this emerging drug at every level and directed the Commission to increase the
       penalties for methamphetamine offenses. Yesterday, the Commission strengthened
       penalties for methamphetamine offenses pursuant to that law.
