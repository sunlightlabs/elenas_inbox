SENATE FLOOR ACTION ON BUDGET RESOLUTION (S.Con.Res. 27):
(The vote on the conference report is to occur after the recess.    Votes
taken on Friday are in boldface.)

Vote on Final Passage (H.Con.Res. 84, as amended with the text of
S.Con.Res. 27): 78-22.

Unanimous Consent Agreement Enabling Two Reconciliation Bills:
Senate agreed by unanimous consent on 5/21 that for purposes of
determining compliance with the Byrd Rule, both reconciliation bills
(spending and tax) will be scored together. This will avoid the
potential Byrd Rule problem with the 2d reconciliation bill (i.e. the tax
bill, standing on its own, is a deficit increaser in the out years) .

Amendments Adopted:
o Kerry Amendment No. 309, to allocate funds for early childhood
development programs for children ages zero to six.

o Domenici/Lautenberg managerD,s technical amendment.

o Snowe amendment (2d degree to Wellstone no. 314) to express the sense of
the Senate relative to higher education tax relief and higher education
expenses.

o Domenici (for Coverdell) Amendment No. 347, to provide for parental
involvement in prevention of drug use by children.

o Lautenberg (for Moseley-Braun) Amendment No. 333, to express the sense
of the Senate regarding the use of budget savings.

of the Senate regarding the value of the social security system for future
retirees.

o McCain/Mack Amendment No. 327, to express the sense of the Senate with
respect to certain highway demonstration projects.   Passed 84-15.

o Abraham Amendment No. 316, to express the sense of the Senate that, to
the extent that future revenues exceed the revenue aggregates, those
additional revenues should be reserved for deficit reduction and tax cuts


only.   Passed 56-44.

o Coverdell 2d degree amendment to Wellstone amendment No. 313; Coverdell
amendment was on school vouchers.   Passed 51-49.

o Domenici (for Kyl) modified Amendment No. 348, to express the sense of
the Senate that the budget resolution agreement does not foreclose the
possibility of Congress adopting additional tax cuts in the future, so
long as they are paid for.

o Faircloth modified Amendment No. 321, to express the sense of the Senate
that a non-refundable tax credit for the expenses of an education at a
2-year college should be enacted.
