MEMORANDUM TO MARIA ECHA VESTE, CHRIS EDLEY, SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL
AND ELENA KAGAN

CC:            Judy Winston

FROM:          Michele Cavataio

SUBJECT:       Options for Organizing a Chapter on Administration Accomplishments for the
               President's Report on Race

Goals

1. Convey Administration's key principles (e.g. opportunity, responsibility, community, etc.)
   and describe successes, occasional missteps, and hard choices in carrying them out.
2. Act as a bridge between chapters on our past history and our future direction. Organizing
   themes need to be consistent with chapters which precede and follow.
3. Use this chapter to tell a compelling story rather than provide a comprehensive list of every
   accomplishment. Resist making every Administration accomplishment a race
   accomplishment.
4. Be honest rather than excessively celebratory.
5. Show the right level of detail without being boring.

Option 1: Organize by Topical Area

Description:   The chapter could be divided into sections on education, economic opportunity,
               antidiscrimination efforts, public safety and the administration of justice, health,
               etc. Each section will begin with a macro level discussion of the key principles
               of the Administration. For example, the education section would begin with the
               overarching objectives of high standards and access to a high quality education for
               all students. The chapter would then address the key policies that have helped to
               meet these objectives for all students. Then, it'would address policies that are
               specifically targeted to minority students. It could be interwoven with short,
               illustrative anecdotes.

Pros:         Covers key areas.
              Easy to skim and go to area of interest.

Cons:         May not clearly highlight Administration themes (opportunity, responsibility.... )
              Boring.
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


Option 2: Organize by Themes or Values

Description:   This chapter could be organized around key themes of the Clinton Administration
               such as: opportunity, responsibility, and community. Or, the themes could cover
               the goals of the race initiative such as: reducing discrimination, overcoming
               disparities and improving race relations. Within each theme would be a
               chronological presentation of Administration policy highlights.

Pros:         Shows consistency throughout the six years of the Administration.

Cons:         Not as neatly organized. Difficult to figure out what to put where.

Option 3: Tell Personal Stories

Description:   This chapter would contain several short stories of people or organizations whose
               lives were transformed by Clinton Administration policies and initiatives. For
               example, one story might describe a revitalized urban community which was
               turned around by a series of policies such as Empowerment Zones and increased
               lending to minority businesses. Another story might describe a high school with
               a large Latino population which has benefited by increased Title I funding,
               bilingual education programs, after school initiatives, and school to work
               programs. A third story might describe a middle class family'S search for
               housing and the increasing opportunities for home ownership made available by
               Administration policies. A fourth story might describe a mother's chance to get
               off welfare, obtain job training, and start a new job.

Pros:         Engaging. Easy for readers to relate.
              Quality not quantity.

Cons:         Highlights only a few key policies.
              May be too self-congratulatory.

Option 4: Organize Chronologically

Description:   This chapter would provide a description of Administration accomplishments in
               chronological order.

Pros:         Can be thorough.
              Can show consistency of Administration policies over time.

Cons:         May be boring.

                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

Option 5: Combination of Above Options

Description:   The chapter could combine several options described above. For example, within
               the thematic approach (option 2), it could be organized chronologically (option 4)
               and include personal stories (option 3).

Pros:         Can show consistency of Administration policies over time.
              Engaging.

Cons:         May not be as tidy.


Content Issues

1. Bipartisanship. This should not be simply a self-congratulatory document. Rather it should
   include a discussion of difficult issues and of successes and failures. It is important to
   appeal to a bipartisan audience so all of America is interested in the issue or at least in the
   document. We might consider a report on the nation's accomplishments rather than solely
   the President's accomplishments.

2. Macro policies. We will need to decide whether to include macro policies such as the
   impact of economic growth on race issues.

3. Race-neutral policies. Should we include policies which are intended to be race neutral but
   which have a disproportionate impact on minorities, whether negative or positive, in areas
   where disparities exist? Policies of this type would include: the EITC, minimum wage
   increases, increased funding for Head Start.

4. Race-targeted policies. It seems obvious that we would include policies that are
   specifically- designed to assist minority groups. This might include policies such as the
   Hispanic Education Initiative, loans to minority businesses, eliminating ethnic health
   disparities, etc.
