DRAFT 3-31-98
                 THE VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR
               LEGISLATION ON PAY EQUITY AND ADMINISTRATION
                INITIATIVES TO COMBAT WAGE DISCRIMINATION
                                 April 2, 1998

Today the Vice President will announce the Administration's support for legislation, introduced
by Senator Daschle and Congresswomen DeLauro, to improve enforcement of wage
discrimination against women and to strengthen the remedy provisions in the Equal Pay Act to
allow for compensatory and punitive damages. The Vice President also will announce several
Administration initiatives aimed at reducing wage discrimination in the private sector and the
federal government. The Vice President will announce the development of a Memorandum of
Understanding between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the
Department of Labor to cross-train their staffs to be sensitive to potential violations of the laws
they enforce, including the Equal Pay Act, and to help the Department of Labor to collect
damages for wage discrimination. The Vice President also will announce a ten-step voluntary
self-audit for both private businesses and the federal agencies in order to help them monitor their
efforts on equal pay. Finally, the Vice President will announce the "Guide to Recruitment and
Retention of Women" in the federal government, a manual designed to assist agency managers
hire and retain talented women.

Legislation to Improve Enforcement of Wage Discrimination. The Vice President will call
on Congress to pass the legislation introduced today which strengthens current laws prohibiting
wage discrimination and provides training and outreach to help enforce these laws. The
highlights of this legislation include:

      Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act. This legislation amends the Equal Pay Act to
       allow for compensatory and punitive damages. Currently, the EPA only provides for
       liquidated damages and back pay awards.

      Non-retaliation Provision. This legislation amends the Equal Pay Act (EPA) to prohibit
       employers from penalizing employees for sharing information about their salaries with
       coworkers.

      Class Actions. The bill amends the procedures for filing class actions under the
       EPA to conform with the general procedural rules for filing federal class actions in
       other areas of the law.

      Training, Research, Education, and Outreach. The bill also enhances programs
       already in place at the Department of Labor, requiring DOL to undertake research
       in the area of sex-based pay disparities; provide information on means of
       eradicating such disparities; assist State and local information and educational
       programs; recognize and promote the achievements of employers that have made
       strides to eliminate pay disparities; and convene a national summit to discuss and
       highlight the issue of sex-based pay disparities. The bill also provides for training
       on matters involving wage discrimination.
                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

           Pav Eauity Award. The bill establishes "The National Award for Pay Equity in the
            Workplace," to be administered by the Department of Labor, to recognize and
            promote the achievements of employers that have made strides to eliminate pay
            disparities.

     Administration Actions to Provide Data Analysis, Technical Assistance, and Enhanced
     Enforcement of Wage Discrimination. The Vice President also will announce a number of
     Administration initiatives that will supplement the legislation introduced today. These
     initiatives will provide increased analysis of data on the wage gap; assist federal agencies in
     enforcing wage discrimination law; provide technical assistance by highlighting "best practices"
     and offering a voluntary self-audit on the Internet; and strengthen the role of the Federal
     Government in hiring and retaining qualified women. These initiatives are:

           Increased Data Analysis on Pay Equitv. The Vice President will announce an annual
            report on the pay gap by sex produced by the Department of Labor. This easy-to-access
            report will raise the awareness of wage disparities and will highlight the issue every year
            in order to spur Americans to achieve increased gender pay equity.

           Memorandum Of Dnderstanding (MOD) between EEOC and DOL to Cross Train and
            Collect Damages. The Vice President will announce that the Department of Labor and
            the EEOC will work together to develop a MOD between the EEOC and the Department
            of Labor to train each other's staff to be sensitive to potential violations of the statutes
            they enforce, including the Equal Pay Act, and to assist referrals of potential violations to
            the applicable EEOC or Labor Department office for appropriate action. In addition, this
            MOD will be developed to permit the Department of Labor's Office of Federal.
            Contractor Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to serve as the EEOC's agent for purposes of
            collecting damages that are not otherwise collectible by OFCCP, including relief for
            intentional discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

           Federal Contractor Best Practices. The Department of Labor will begin to
            pUblicize successful programs of federal contractors by placing them on the
            Department of Labor's web site.

           to-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Businesses and Employees. The Department of Labor
            will place on the Internet a lO-step package that would give companies guidelines in
            order to determine whether they offer equal pay, hiring, and promotional opportunities.
            A similar checklist for employees will also be placed on the Internet.

           lO-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Agencies. The Vice President will announce that the
            federal agencies will take the lO-step self-audit developed by the Department of Labor
            and use the results from the self-audit to monitor their efforts on equal pay.

           Guide to Recruitment and Retention of Women. The Vice President will announce
            OPM's new Guide on Recruitment and Retention of Women in the federal government
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
