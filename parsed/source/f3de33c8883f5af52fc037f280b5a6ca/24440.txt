                            REFORMING WELFARE


           On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and
           Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, fulfilling his longtime commitment to 'end
           welfare as we know it. ' As the President said upon signing, "". this legislation
           provides an historic opportunity to end welfare as we know it and transform our
           broken welfare system by promoting the fondamental values of work,
           responsibility, and family. "


                     TRANSFORMING THE BROKEN WELFARE SYSTEM

          Overhauling the Welfare System with the Personal Responsibility Act: In 1996, the
           President signed a bipartisan welfare plan that is dramatically changing the nation's
           welfare system into one that requires work in exchange for time-limited assistance. The
           law contains strong work requirements, performance bonuses to reward states for moving
           welfare recipients into jobs and reducing illegitimacy, state maintenance of effort
           requirements, comprehensive child support enforcement, and supports for families
           moving from welfare to work -- including increased funding for child care. State
           strategies are making a real difference in the success of welfare reform, specifically in
           job placement, child care and transportation.

           Law Builds on the Administration's Welfare Reform Strategy: Even before the.
           Personal Responsibility Act became law, many states were well on their way to changing
           their welfare programs to jobs programs. By granting Federal waivers, the Clinton
           Administration allowed 43 states -- more than all previous Administrations combined --
           to require work, time-limit assistance, make work pay, improve child support
           enforcement, and encourage parental responsibility. The vast majority of states have
           chosen to continue or build on their welfare demonstration projects approved by the
           Clinton Administration.

           Welfare Rolls Decline as More Recipients go to Work: In January 1999, the President
           released state-by-state data (from September 1998) showing that welfare caseloads are at
           their lowest level in 30 years and that the welfare rolls have fallen by nearly half since he
           took office. Since January 1993, 36 states have had caseload declines of more than 40
           percent and nationwide the rolls have fallen by 44 percent, from 14.1 million to just
           below 8 million. This historic decline occurred in response to the Administration's
           grants of Federal waivers to 43 states, the provisions ofthe new welfare reform law, and
           the strong economy. Recent information released by the Department of Health and
           Human Services also shows that the percentage of welfare recipients working has tripled
           since 1992, that an estimated 1.5 million people who were on welfare in 1997 were
           working in 1998, and that all states met the first overall work participation rates required
           under the welfare reform law.

                 MOVING PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK                 on version   m

   Mobilizing the Business Community: At the President's urging, the Welfare to Work
    Partnership was launched in May 1997 to lead the national business effort to hire people
    from the welfare rolls. Founded with 105 participating businesses, the Partnership grew
    to 5,000 within one year, and in his 1999 State of the Union address, the President
    announced that the Partnership now inCludes over 10,000 businesses who have hired
    hundreds of thousands of people. Since 1997, these businesses have hired over 410,000
    welfare recipients, more than meeting the challenge the President set in May of 1998. The
    Partnership provides technical assistance and support to businesses around the country,
    including: a toll-free number, a web site, a quarterly newsletter, and a "Blueprint for
    Business" hiring manual. The Partnership also published The Road to Retention, a
    report of companies that have found higher retention rates for former welfare recipients
    for other new hires, and strategies they used to achieve this success.

   Connecting Small Businesses with New Workers: The Small Business Administration
    is addressing the unique and vital role of small businesses who employ over one-half of
    the private workforce, by helping small businesses throughout the country connect with
    job training organizations and job-ready welfare recipients. In addition, SBA provides
    training and assistance to welfare recipients who wish to start their own businesses.
    SBA provides assistance to businesses through its 1-800-U-ASK-SBA number, as well
    through its network of small business and women's business centers, one-stop capital
    shops, district offices, and its home page.

   Mobilizing Civic, Religious and Non-profit Groups: The Vice President created the
    Welfare to Work Coalition to Sustain Success, a coalition of national civic, seryice, and
    faith-based groups committed to helping former welfare recipients succeed in the
    workforce. Working in part~ership with public agencies and employers, Coalition
    members provide mentoring, job training, child care, transportation, and other support to
    help these new workers with the transition to self sufficiency. Charter members of the
    Coalition include: Alpha Kappa Alpha, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Baptist
    Joint Committee, Goodwill, Salvation Army, the United Way, Women's Missionary
    Union, the YMCA, the YWCA, and other civic and faith-based groups.

   Doing Our Fair Share with the Federal Government's Hiring Initiative: Under the
    Clinton Administration, the Federal workforce is the smallest it has been in thirty years.
    Yet, this Administration also believes that the Federal government, as the nation's largest
    employer, must lead by example. The President asked the Vice President to oversee the
    Federal government's hiring initiative in which Federal agencies have committed to
    directly hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients in the next four years. On March I st, the
    Vice President announced that the federal government has hired over 10,000 welfare
    recipients nearly two years ahead of schedule. As a part of this effort, the White House
    pledged to hire six welfare recipients and has already exceeded this goal.


   Funds to Help Move More People from Welfare to Work, with a Focus on Fathers:
    Because of the President's leadership, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act included the total
    funding requested by the President for the creation of his $3 billion welfare to work fund.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
      This program helps states and local communities move long-tenn welfare recipients, and
     certain non-custodial parents, into lasting, unsubsidized jobs_ These funds can be used for
     job creation, job placement and job retention efforts, including wage subsidies to private
     employers and other critical post-employment support services. The Department of
     Labor provides oversight but most of the dollars are placed, through the Private Industry
     Councils, in the hands of the localities who are on the front lines of the welfare refonn
     effort. In addition, 25 percent of the funds are awarded by the Department of Labor on
     a competitive basis to support innovative welfare to work projects. The President
     announced the first round of 49 competitive grants in May, and the Vice President
     announced the second round of75 competitive grants in November 1998. In January
     1999, the Department of Labor announced the availability of $240 million in competitive
     grants for FY 1999. These funds will support innovative local welfare-to-work strategies
     for noncustodial parents, individuals with limited English proficiency, disabilities,
     substance abuse pro~lems, or a history of domestic violence.

     The President's FY 2000 budget includes $1 billion for the Welfare-to-Work program to
     help 200,000 long-tenn welfare recipients in high-poverty areas move into lasting
     unsubsidized employment. This is an extension of the two-year $3 billion
     Welfare-to-Work program the President secured in the Balanced Budget Act. The
     initiative, as reauthorized, will provide at least $150 million to ensure that every state helps
     fathers fulfill their responsibilities by working, paying child support, and playing a
     responsible part in their children's lives. Under this proposal, states and communities
     will use a minimum of 20 percent of their fonnula funds to provide job placement and job
     retention assistance to low-income fathers who sign personal responsibility contracts
     committing them to work and pay child support. This effort will further increase child
     support collections, which have risen 80 percent since the President took office, from $8
     billion in 1992 to $14.4 billion in 1998. Remaining funds will go toward assisting
     long-tenn welfare recipients with the greatest barriers to employment to move into lasting
     jobs. The reauthorized program also will double the welfare-to-work funding available
     for tribes.

     Tax Credits for Employers: The Welfare to Work Tax Credit, enacted in the 1997
    . Balanced Budget Act, provides a credit equal to 35 percent of the first $10,000 in wages
      in the first year of employment, and 50 percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the second
      year, to encourage the hiring and retention of long tenn welfare recipients. This credit
      complements the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides a credit of up to $2,400
      for the first year of wages for eight groups of job seekers. The Omnibus Budget Act
      included an extension through June 30, 1999 and the President's FY 2000 budget
      proposes to extend both credits for an additional year.

    Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers: In his FY 1999 budget, the President proposed
     $283 million for 50,000 new housing vouchers for welfare recipients who need housing
     assistance to get or keep ajob, and Congress approved full funding for this new initiative.
     Families will use these housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long
     commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from
     getting to work every day on time. Nearly all of these vouchers will be awarded to
     communities on a competitive basis, to communities who create cooperative efforts
     among their housing, welfare and employment agencies to assure the most effective use
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

    of this flexible new tool to help people make the transition from welfare to work. The
    President's FY 2000 budget provides $430 million for 75,000 welfare-to-work vouchers,
    including $144 million in new funds for 25,000 additional vouchers.

   Welfare-to-Work Transportation: One ofthe biggest barriers facing people who
    move from welfare to work -- in cities and in rural areas -- is finding transportation to get
    to jobs, training programs and child care centers. Few welfare recipients own cars.
    Existing mass transit does not provide adequate links to many suburban jobs at all, or
    within a reasonable commute time. In addition, many entry level jobs require evening or
    weekend hours that are poorly served by existing transit routes. To help those on welfare
    get to work, President Clinton proposed a $100 million a year welfare to work
    transportation plan as part of his ISTEA reauthorization bill. The Transportation Equity
    Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) authorized $750 million over five years for the
    President's initiative and reverse commute grants. Of this amount, $50 million is
    guaranteed funding in FY 1999, rising to $150 million in 2003. The Omnibus Budget Act
    included $75 million for this program in FY 1999 and the Department of Transportation
    is currently reviewing applications for this first year funding. The President's budget
    proposes to double funding for FY 2000, bringing it to the full authorized level of $150
    million. The Job Access competitive grants will assist states and localities in developing
    flexible transportation alternatives, such as van services, for welfare recipients and other
    low income workers.

   Eliminating Anti-Work and Anti-FamiJy Rules that Denied Families Health Coverage: In
    August 1998, the President eliminated a vestige of the old welfare system by announcing
    that the Department of Health and Human Services will revise its regulations to allow all
    states to provide Medicaid coverage to working, two-parent families who meet State
    income eligibility. Under the old welfare regulations, adults in two-parent families who
    worked more than 100 hours per month could not receive Medicaid regardless of income
    level, while there were no such restrictions on single-parent families. Because these
    regulations provided disincentives to marriage and full-time work, the Administration
    allowed a number of states to waive this rule. The new regulation eliminates this rule
    for all States, providing health coverage for more than 130,000 working families to help
    them stay employed and off welfare.


                   PROMOTING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

   Enforcing Child Support -- 80% Increase in Collections: The Clinton Administration
    collected a record $14.4 billion in child support in 1998 through tougher enforcement, an
    increase of$6.4 billion, or 80% since 1992. Not only are collections up, but the number
    of families that are actually receiving child support has also increased. In 1997, the
    number of child support cases with collections rose to 4.2 million, an increase of 48%
    fom 2.8 million in 1992. In addition, a new collection system proposed by the President
    in 1994 and enacted as part of the 1996 welfare reform law located one million
    delinquent parents in its first nine months of operation. This National Directory of New
    Hires helps track parents across state lines by enabling child support officials to match
    records of delinquent parents with wage records from throughout the nation.
    Approximately one-third of all child support cases involve parents living in different
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

    states. In June 1998, the President signed the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, a law
    based on his 1996 proposal for tougher penalties for parents who repeatedly fail to
    support children living in another state or who flee across state lines to avoid supporting
    them. This new law creates two new felonies, with penalties of up to two years in
    prison, for egregious child support evaders who travel across state or country lines to
    evade child support obligations, or who have an unpaid obligation to a child living in
    another state that is more than $10,000 or has remained unpaid for more than two years.

    Increasing Parental Responsibility: The President's unprecedented and sustained
    campaign to ensure parents financially support their children is working. Paternity
    establishment, often the crucial first step in child support cases, has dramatically
    increased, due in large part to the in-hospital voluntary paternity establishment program
    begun in 1994 by the Clinton Administration. In 1997, the number of paternities
    established or acknowledged rose to a record 1.3 million, two and a half times the 1992
    figure of 512,000. In addition to tougher enforcement including a strong partnership
    with states, President Clinton has taken executive action including: directing the Treasury
    Department to collect past-due child support from Federal payments including Federal
    income tax refunds and employee salaries, and taking steps to deny Federal loans to any
    delinquent parents. The Federal government collected over $1.1 billion in delinquent
    child support from federal income tax refunds for tax year 1997, a 70 percent increase
    since 1992. The welfare reform law contains tough child support measures that President
    Clinton has long supported including: the national new hire reporting system; streamlined
    paternity establishment; uniform interstate child support laws; computerized state-wide
    collections; and tough new penalties. These five measures are projected to increase child
    support collections by an additional $24 billion over the next ten years.

   Breaking the Cycle of Dependency -- Preventing Teen Pregnancy: Significant
    components of the President's comprehensive effort to reduce teen pregnancy became law
    when the President signed the 1996 Personal Responsibility Act. The law requires
    unmarried minor parents to stay in school and live at home or in a supervised setting;
    encourages "second chance homes" to provide teen parents with the skills and support
    they need; and provides $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education
    activities. Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has supported innovative and
    promising teen pregnancy prevention strategies, including working with boys and young
    men on pregnancy prevention strategies. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen
    Pregnancy, a private nonprofit organization, wa!l formed in response to the President's
    1995 State of the Union. In 1997, the President announced the National Strategy to
    Prevent Teen Pregnancy, mandated in the welfare reform law. The first annual report on
    this Strategy reported that HHS-supported programs already reach at least 31 percent or
    1,470 communities in the United States. Notably, data shows we are making progress in
    reducing teen pregnancy -- teen births have fallen six years in a row, by 15 percent from
    1991 to 1997. And, teen pregnancy rates are at their lowest level in 20 years.

           RESTORING FAIRNESS AND PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE

    The President made a commitment to fix several provisions in the welfare refonn law that had
    nothing to do with moving people from welfare to work. In 1997, the President fought for and
    ultimately was successful in ensuring that the Balanced Budget Act protects the most vulnerable.
     In 1998, the President continued to reverse unfair cuts in benefits to legal immigrants. The
    Administration's FY 2000 budget would build on this progress by restoring important disability,
    health, and nutrition benefits to additional categories of legal immigrants, at a cost of $1.3 billion
    over five years.

          Disability and Health: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 restored disability and health
           benefits to 420,000 legal immigrants who were in this country before welfare refonn
           became law (August 22, 1996), at an estimated cost of $11.5 billion. The
           Administration's new budget would restore eligibility for SSI and Medicaid to legal
           immigrants who enter the country after that date ifthey have been in the U.S. for five
           years and become disabled after entering the United States. This proposal would cost
           approximately $930 million and assist an estimated 54,000 legal immigrants by 2004,
           about half of whom would be elderly.

          Nutritional Assistance: The Agricultural Research Act of 1998 provided Food Stamps
           for 225,000 legal immigrant children, senior citizens, and people with disabilities who
           came to the United States by August 22, 1996. The Administration's budget would
           extend this provision by allowing legal immigrants in the United States on August 22,
           1996 who subsequently reach age 65 to be eligible for Food Stamps at cost of $60
           million.

          Childrens' Health Care and Maternal Care for Pregnant Women: States currently
           can provide health coverage to immigrant children who .entered the country before August
           22, 1996. The President's FY 2000 budget would give states the option to provide health
           coverage to legal immigrant children who entered the country after August 22, 1996.
           Under this proposal, states could provide health coverage to those children through
           Medicaid or their CHIP allotment. The proposal would cost $220 million and serve
           approximately 55,000 children by FY 2004. Furthennore, the budget proposes to give
           states the option to provide Medicaid coverage to legal immigrant women who entered
           the country after August 22, 1996 and subsequently became pregnant. Such coverage
           would help reduce the number of high-risk pregnancies, ensure healthier children, and
           lower the cost of emergency Medicaid deliveries. This proposal would cost $105 million
           and serve approximately 23,000 women by FY 2004.


          Helping PeopJe Who Want to Work but Can't Find a Job:       The Balanced Budget Act
           (BBA), as amended by the Agricultural Research Act, also restored $1.3 billion in food
           stamp cuts. The welfare refonn law restricted food stamps for able-bodied childless
           adults to only 3 out of every 36 months, unless they were working. This move ignored
           the fact that finding a job often takes time. The BBA provided funds for work slots and
           food stamp benefits to help those who are willing to work but, through no fault of their
           own, have not yet found employment. In addition, the BBA allows states to exempt up to
           15 percent of the food stamp recipients (70,000 individuals monthly) who would
