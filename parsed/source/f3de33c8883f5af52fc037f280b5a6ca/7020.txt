                                    April 9, 1998




I.   ADMINISTRATION POSITIONS ON TOBACCO FARMER ISSUES


Q.   Why is the President going to Kentucky?

A.   The President is going to Kentucky, the heart of burley tobacco country, to discuss the
     need for comprehensive tobacco legislation that reduces youth smoking but provides for
     the future of family farming and rural communities_ In his statement last September, the
     President said that protecting farmers and their communities was one of the key five
     principles that must be included in any comprehensive tobacco legislation he would be
     willing to sign. The President is going to Kentucky to discuss the impact of tobacco
     legislation directly with farmers and effected communities, and urge passage of
     legislation that meets the needs of reducing teen smoking and protects farmers and their
     communities. The President will say that legislation authored by Senator Ford and
     introduced as part of the McCain bill meets the goal of protecting farmers and their
     communities.

Q.   What is the President's position on programs for tobacco farmers?

A:     The President made protecting farmers and their communities one of the five key
       principles that must be included in any comprehensive tobacco legislation. Senator
       Ford's bill, which provides for compensation for losses to quota owners and producers,
       and makes provision for losses to rural communities where tobacco is grown, meets the
       President's goal of protecting farmers. The President is encouraged that both the
     . interests of flue-cured and burley farmers are included in the proposal, and hopes that all
       farmers will continue working together to ensure that legislation is passed this year.

Q.   Aren't the goals of reducing youth smoking and protecting tobacco farmers
     contradictory?

A:   No. The President does not want the tobacco companies to go out of business, only
     out of the business of selling to children. The tobacco farmers have played by the rules,
     and should be protected in any legislation that passes. The President believes that we
     can reduce youth smoking and protect rural communities if we all work together to urge
     Congress to pass bipartisan comprehensive tobacco legislation this year.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion     y em

Q.       Senator Lugar recently suggested in an op-ed that the tobacco program should be
       . phased out. Does the Administration agree?

A.      The Administration feels that any legislation has to be evaluated in terms of how well it
        meets the President's five principles -- including reducing youth smoking and protecting
        farmers and their communities. Advocates of a free market for tobacco growers will
        need to demonstrate that it is consistent with these principles. Many health groups have
        argued that simply ending the tobacco program may actually increase the amount of
        tobacco that is grown, decrease the cost of tobacco, and provide a windfall for cigarette
        companies. In addition, representatives offamily farms have suggested that ending the
        tobacco program would have extremely negative economic effects on them and their
        communities. The President went to Kentucky, in part, to discuss the various legislative
        options with those directly effected by tobacco legislation and hear their opinions
        first-hand


II.     BACKGROUND QUESTIONS RE: TOBACCO FARMERS

Q. How important is tobacco to Kentucky producers and the overall economy?

A. Including sales from fire-cured and dark air-cured tobacco, Kentucky tobacco producers
          received over $800 million from the 1997 crop. Tobacco sales represent over 40
percent of           crop sales receipts and over 20 percent of all agricultural sales in Kentucky.

      In 1997, over 600 million pounds of burley tobacco was produced in the United States - 70
           percent in Kentucky.

Q. Who will be affected by a settlement?

A. The tobacco settlement will have a wide-reaching impact on all segments of the tobacco
           industry, but a disproportionate effect on small and minority tobacco quota owners
and                   producers. Of the 338,000 individual quotas, about 66 percent are
considered small farm                 operations. Five percent of all quotas are owned by
minorities, the majority of which are                small producers.

Q. Why is tobacco so important to small farmers?

A.      Tobacco is a high value crop that generates gross receipts of $4,000 to $5,000 per acre.
        Profits from 1 acre of tobacco are equivalent to between 15 and 20 acres of com or
        soybeans. On small farms in Kentucky, with an average of22 acres of harvested
        cropland in 1992, tobacco is vital to the economic survival offarmers. (source: 1992 Ag
        Census)

Q. How much tobacco is grown in the United States?
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

A_ In 1997, tobacco production totaled 1.7 billion pounds with a value of over $3 billion, the
        highest production and crop receipts since 1992. Sales of tobacco products reached a
record         $50 billion in 1997.


Q.     How does the tobacco program work?

A.     Since the 1930s, in order to grow tobacco, a fanner must have a quota. The quota allows
       the fanner to grow a certain amount of tobacco for that year. Thus, the amount of tobacco
       grown in the United States is controlled by law. In addition, the price of tobacco is set
       statutorily. If a private company chooses not to purchase tobacco at or above the
       statutory minimum price, the regional cooperative of tobacco fanners will purchase the
       tobacco and store it, putting the tobacco back on the market when the price is more
       favorable.

 Q.    What are the provisions of the Ford bill which is included in the McCain
       legislation?

A:     Senators Ford, Frist, and Hollings, the three members of the Senate Commerce
       Committee from tobacco-growing states, joined together to include a farmer
       provision in the McCain tobacco legislation. While maintaining a production
       control system for all tobacco farmers, this package sets up somewhat different
       systems for burley and flue-cured tobacco. For burley tobacco (grown mostly in
       Kentucky), the package includes an optional buy-out for quota holders at $8 per
       pound, and retains the quota system for those who do not take the buyout, but
       provides payments to both remaining quota holders, lessees, and tenants to the
       extent that base quota declines. For flue-cured tobacco, the plan provides for a
       mandatory buyout of existing quota holders, and replaces the quota system with a
       permit system that gives the new permits at no cost to active producers, regardless
       of whether they previously held a quota. This transferring of quotas from inactive
       quota holders to actual producers is intended to make it possible for active farmers
       to sell tobacco without incurring the cost of buying or renting quota.

       The provision authored by Senator Ford and included in McCain's legislation also
       provides approximately $500 million for assistance to tobacco-producing
       communities. The package costs $2.1 billion per year for the first ten years and
       $500 million for years 11-25 for a total of $28.5 billion. For the most part, tobacco
       farm leaders have been pleased with the proposal included in the McCain
       legislation.



II.    GENERAL BACKGROUND ON TOBACCO LEGISLATION

Q:     Has the President endorsed the McCain bill?
                                                                      Hex-DiJmp Conversion


A:    The President believes that this bill represents a dramatic step forward. It would raise
      the price of cigarettes, give the FDA full authority to regulate tobacco products, ban
      advertising aimed at children, and protect tobacco farmers.
      But he also said we still have work to do on this legislation. Above all, we need to put in
      place tough penalties that will cost the tobacco industry if it continues to sell cigarettes to
      young people. We're not trying to put the tobacco companies out of business; we want to
      put them out of the business of selling cigarettes to kids. This week's progress in the
      Senate shows we have real momentum in both parties to do just that.

Q:    The President says we need stronger penalties on companies that continue to sell to
      our children. What does he mean by that?

A:    The McCain bill's penalty provisions are deficient for two reasons. First, the bill has a
      cap of $3.5 billion per year on industry-wide penalties, no matter how much the industry
      misses youth targets by. Second, the McCain bill contains no penalties on individual
      companies for failing to meet youth smoking targets. Reducing youth smoking is our
      bottom line, and we must make it each and every company's bottom line.

Q:    Does the Administration have concerns about provisions of the McCain bill besides
      the penalties?

A:    We have serious concerns about this bill's provision which would allow individual States
      to "opt out" of the national smoke-free environment policy. This provision creates a
      patchwork system in which states could decide to adopt weaker laws or decide against
      taking any action at all, leaving people with little or no protection from the hazards of
      'environmental tobacco smoke. In addition, there is no need to exempt the tobacco
      industry from antitrust rules in order to reduce youth smoking. We strongly oppose any
      exemptions that would allow price fixing agreements. Third, we believe it is critical that
      tobacco legislation fund efforts to promote public health and assist children.

Q:What does the President want the tobacco funds to be spent on?

A:    The President strongly believes that tobacco revenues should go toward protecting public
      health and assisting children. His budget provides for funds for anti-smoking programs
      that will help us meet the goals of reducing youth smoking rates and for a dramatic
      expansion of health-related research to help us cure smoking-related disease. Finally, in
      recognition of the states' role in bringing suit against tobacco companies, the President's
      budget provides for a substantial amount of money to revert to the states. Some of this
      money can be used for any purpose. Other funds must be used on state-administered
      programs to assist children (specifically, for child care, Medicaid child outreach, and
      class size reduction).

Q:    What is your view of the liability protections for the tobacco industry contained in
      Senator McCain's legislation?
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


A:   As we have said on many occasions, we would prefer comprehensive tobacco legislation
     without liability limits, but in the context oflegislation that meets all of the President's
     principles and dramatically reduces youth smoking, reasonable limits on liability will not
     be a dealbreaker. Right now, we're going to focus on the aspects of the McCain
     legislation that we think fall short of what the President has demanded: particularly, on
     the penalties in the biIl to reduce youth smoking. Until we get those right, we won't
     address liability protections.

Q:   The tobacco industry has said that it will not agree to national tobacco legislation
     that increases the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over five years, as proposed
     by the President's budget and the McCain bill_ Does that doom the President's
     proposal?

A:   No. We have always expected the tobacco companies to fight hard for their economic
     interests, but needless to say we will not always agree, nor we think wiIl the US
     Congress. This price increase called for in the President's budget is necessary to meet
     his youth smoking targets, and he wiIl continue to demand it. What the companies do is
     up to them, but we wiIl not back off such necessary measures to reduce youth smoking.

Q:   What are the five principles that the President has said tobacco legislation must
     meet?

A:   President Clinton has said he wiIl only support tobacco legislation that:

           Raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over 5 years and $1.50 a pack
            over the next ten years, and imposes tough penalties on companies that continue
            to sell to kids;

           Affirms the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;

           Gets companies out of the business of marketing and selling tobacco to minors;

           Promotes public health research and public health goals; and

           Protects our tobacco farmers and their communities.

Q:   How does the McCain bill compare to the Attorneys General proposed settlement
     and the President's proposal?

A:   See chart below.

Q:      Is teen smoking going up or down?
      On April 2, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta released a new study
("Tobacco Use Among High School Students -- United States, 1997") which found that
                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
    cigarette smoking rates among high school students rose by nearly a third between 1991
    and 1997, from 27.5 percent to 36.4 percent, with the sharpest increase among African
    American students. Cigarette smoking was highest among white students (40 percent),
    rising by 28 percent from 1991 (31 percent). While the level of cigarette smoking among
