I talked to Carper Friday, and told him not to push this, but I don't
think Podesta or I convinced him.

We still need to work out a clear position on the
hours/fill-in-the-gap/how-to-count-child-support issues that we dodged
last time. They're not going away, but we should find a way that works
for us.

                                                                          DRAFT 9/98:00 p.m.
                       House Ways and Means Welfare Proposal
                             (based on 9/8 verbal reports)

                                      Talking Points

   The proposal would undermine welfare reform by weaking the welfare law's work
    requirements.

   Welfare recipients could be required to work just a few hours a week, instead of the 20
    hours now required and 30 hour required by the year 2000.

   The proposal would create a loophole making publicly-run workfare programs more
    attractive than private jobs. Welfare recipients in workfare wouldn't have to do real
    work for 20 or 30 hours a week -- many of those hours could be filled with non-work
    activities such as job search, job readiness, and vocational education.

   Welfare recipients receiving child support payments would be able to work evert fewer
    hours, because those support payments retained by the state to repay taxpayers for welfare
    costs could not be used for salaries for workfare participants. A $100 child support
    payment retained by the state could lower the work requirement by nearly 20 hours per
    month.

   States say they need flexibility to make welfare reform work. We say they already have
    it. Because they receive a welfare block grant with few restrictions, states can shift the
    $3 to $4 billion a year savings from falling welfare caseloads into workfare programs and
    still come out ahead. At the same time, states can count both TANF and food stamp
    benefits as wages. With this flexibility, states that choose to put people in workfare
    rather than private sector jobs will be able pay the minimum wage for 20 to 30 hours a
    week.


                                         Options

    Option #1: Retain the tough but fair work rates in current law.

    Option #2: Retain the tough but fair work rates in current law, but do not allow states to
    use child support they retain as payment for wages (states would have to fill the gap with
    other funds).

    Option #3: Retain current law for work up to 20 hours a week (only a minimum of 20
    hours of work as now defined would count); allow additional job search, etc., for hours of
    work above 20 hours per week. States could count child support payments to pay wages
    for up to 20 hours per week.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
                                         Current Law

                                     What Counts as Work

The following are the work activities always pennitted under the welfare law:

1.     Unsubsidized employment
2.     Subsidized private sector employment
3.     Subsidized public sector employment
4.     Work experience
5.     On-the-job training
6.     The first 6 weeks of job search and job readiness assistance
7.     Community service programs
8.     The first 12 months of vocational educational training
9.     Providing child care for someone in a community service program

The following are additional work activities that can be counted from 20 to 30 hours a week:

1.     Job skills training directly related to employment;
2.     For those with no high school diploma, high school attendance, GED study, or education
       directly related to employment


                                           Ouestions

1.     What is the practical difference between a subsidized public sector job and work
       experience? Between these and community service programs? Is there a grey area
       between them? What are some examples of subsidized public sector jobs?

2.     Are any states creating "private sector work experience," or private workfare? We have
       heard reports that Ohio is doing so. How does money flow in such a situation? Who
       pays the worker? Whom does the state pay? Whom does the company pay?

       How does this differ from subsidized private employment? Subsidized public
       employment?

       If workfare is exempted from FICA, would that create an incentive for business to shift to
       private workfare instead of subsidizedlunsubsidized jobs?

3.     What is the difference between work experience and community service programs?
       What are real life examples of the differences?

4.     Do some of these shifting realities make it advisable that we define some of these tenns
       in the regulation? Does HHS's draft reg address these questions in any way?
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

                                      Child Support Enforcement

The proposed child support provision coupled with the proposal's "maximium hours" provision
would weaken the welfare law's work rates even further. For example, let's consider a welfare
recipient receiving $300 a month in T ANF, $100 a month in food stamps, and $50 a month in
child support which the state "retains" to offset welfare costs.

Under current law that welfare recipient would have to work the minimum 80 hours a month. If
the state put that person in workfare slot at the minimum wage, the state would have to contribute
an additional $12 a month in welfare funds to pay the minimum wage for those 80 hours. Under
the proposed provision requiring only as much work as the benefit level divided by the minimum
wage (the so-called "maximum hours" policy), the person would have to work only 78 hours a
month. And if, in addition, the state was required to subtract retained child support payments,
the welfare recipient would have to work only 68 hours a month (see chart A below).

Advocates say that custodial parents shouldn't have to ''work off their child support." This
argument assumes that a parent on welfare is entitled to all her child support; in fact, there's a
long history of the government requiring families to give up that right in order to receive welfare.
It is true that if the "maximum hours" policy were put into effect but the child support change
was not made, a woman getting the same amount of child support would have to work more
hours if the state retained the payment than if it passed through the payment but reduced the
welfare grant to compensate (compare columns 1 and 3 of Chart C to the same columns on Chart
D). However, that "inequity" can be solved by sticking to current 20 hour a week work rates.
Another valid but rarely heard argument is that allowing states to count child support as wages
would undermine the principle of the minimum wage.
