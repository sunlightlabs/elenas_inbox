PRESIDENT CLINTON STRONGLY OPPOSES THE REPUBLICAN COMP TIME
PROPOSALS BEFORE CONGRESS BECAUSE:

    The President believes employees should be able to choose to receive overtime in income,
     or trade it in for time off to be with their families.

    The Republican proposals could drastically limit the ability of employees to earn overtime
     pay. Many working families rely on overtime wages to pay for their rent, food, and clothing.
     The Republican proposal could take that valuable overtime payout of their pockets. It allows
     companies to force employees to take comp time instead of overtime, e.g., by allowing only
     workers who will take comp time to work more than 40 hours a week.

   Under Republican proposals, employees lose control over when to take the comp time
    they have earned. The Senate GOP bill allows employers to "cash out" any earned comp .
    time with just 30 days notice -- even if the employee was planning to use that time for extended
    maternity leave: Employers could also deny an employee's request to use comp time if they
    claim business would be "unduly disrupted" -- even if the employee is simply doing something
    that's already covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act.

   The Republican proposals have no effective remedy against employer abuses. The only
    remedy available to employees is a lawsuit against employers who force them to take comp
    time. That's not a practical remedy for most lower-paid workers. And there is no remedy at
    all when employers deny overtime to an employee who prefers that option.

   Republican proposals undermine the 40-hour work week. Under the GOP proposal,
    employers could make employees work extra hours (beyond the 40 hour) during a week they
    have taken comp time without paying overtime. Under Senator Ashcroft's biweekly work or
    flexible credit programs, employees are never entitled to overtime unless the employer
    specifically requested it in advance.

HERE IS WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DOES SUPPORT:

   Flex-time that gives employees !!!Q!: choice, not less -- letting them choose between time
    off and overtime pay, whichever is best for them. Under the President's plan, employees
    and their families are the ones who choose if, how, and when they use comp time. Under the
    Republican bill, employers, not employees, make those decisions -- and employees are not
    adequately protected from employer abuses of these laws.

   The President's legislation would Expand the Family and Medical Leave Act and Give
    Employees New Choices on Flex Time. The President's plan would allow a worker to take
    unpaid hours off -- up to 24 hours annually -- for parent-teacher conferences, their children's
    regular doctor visits, or to care for older relatives' health needs.
