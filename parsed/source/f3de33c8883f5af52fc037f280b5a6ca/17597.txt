TODAY'S GDP DATA SHOW THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY CONTINUES TO ENJOY STRONG
GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION. OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE ECONOMY HAS GROWN AN
IMPRESSIVE 4 PERCENT -- BOOSTED BY $125 BILLION IN NEW EXPORTS.

      4.0 Percent Growth Over Past Year. Over the past year, the economy grew a strong 4 percent -- the
       fastest rate in nearly a decade. In the third quarter of 1997, the economy expanded at a 3.5 percent
       annual rate. And since President Clinton took office, growth has averaged 3.0 percent per year --
       relative to 1.3 percent per year under President Bush and 2.4 percent per year during the
       Reagan-Bush years.

      Exports Up $125 Billion Over Past Year. Over the past year, exports have grown 15 percent -- that's
       $125 billion more in American exports, helping to create high-paying American jobs.

      Investment is Booming. In the third quarter, Investment in business equipment rose 22 percent in at
       an annual rate, after rising 23 percent in the second quarter. That's the first time investment has
       grown by more than 20 percent for two quarters in a row in almost 15 years. And since President
       Clinton has taken office, investment has grown more than under any President since John F.
       Kennedy.

      Private-Sector Growth is Strong. Over the past year, the private sector grew an impressive 4.7 percent.
        This means that since President Clinton took office, the private sector of the economy has grown by
       3.6 percent per year, compared to 3.0 percent under President Reagan and 1.3 percent under
       President Bush.

      Inflation Remains Low. Inflation as measured by the GDP price index was 1.9 percent over the past
       year, down from 2.4 percent during the previous 12-month period.

IN RECENT WEEKS, WE HAVE HAD MORE GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY:
     Since President Clinton took office, the deficit has been cut from $290 billion to $23 billion -- a 92%
      drop.
     The Homeownership rate hit its highest level in American history.
     The economy has now produced over 13 million new jobs and the unemployment rate is below 5% for
      the first time in 24 years. All the while, inflation remains low and stable.

                   EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG

      Alan Greenspan, 7/22/97: "The recent performance of the economy, characterized by strong growth
       and low inflation, has been exceptional-- and better than most anticipated."

      Martin Zimmerman: Chief Economist, Ford Motor Co.: "The U.S. economy is in remarkable
       shape." [Wall Street 10wn.l, October 31, 1997]

      Fortune, 6/9/97: "Business is booming, inflation is falling, jobs are plentiful, and American
       industry is way out in front. The U.S. economy is stronger than it's ever been before."
