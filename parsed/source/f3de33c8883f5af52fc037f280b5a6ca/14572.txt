                                      Health Care Reforms


       As we constrain growth in the Medicare and Medicaid programs through long overdue
        payment and structural refonns, my budget also makes modest but important investments
        in improving the health care system.

       Specifically, the budget includes targeted and capped investments to expand coverage to
        two groups of deserving Americans: children and workers between jobs.

        o
               Almost 10 million children are uninsured. Because almost half of all children
               who become uninsured do so because their parent has lost or changed a job, these
               initiatives include a provision to provide premiums assistance for children and
               their parents who are in-between jobs. They are targeted and capped, and will
               also cover up to 5 million children and over 2 million adult workers (and their
               spouses).

       States can best identify and reach out to their citizens in need of health insurance. As
        such, all of our coverage expansions would be administered by the states.

       It is important that we can show the nation that we can work together to give working
        Americans the help they need to purchase health insurance. These initiatives aim to both
        reduce the unacceptable levels of people without insurance and make for a more health,
        stable workforce.

       Avoid engaging on specific approaches to expanding coverage, particularly tax
        credits.

               Child health tax credits: While the Republicans and the Democratic Leadership
               is interested in expanding coverage through tax deductions/credits, serious
               questions have been raised about whether they would be effective or
               administratively feasible. Many believe that they would simply give public
               dollars to people who are already paying for insurance, resulting in little new
               coverage. We are open, however, to thinking about how to combine a tax credit
               with other more effective options, like a Medicaid buy-in program or the grants to
               states.
