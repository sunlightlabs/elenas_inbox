A FRAMEWORK FOR CHANGE:
The Immigration and Naturalization Service


Background

America has always been a nation of immigrants, and this Administration is
proud of the significant progress we have made toward improving AmericaO,s
immigration system. Over the last five years, the INS has worked hard to
curtail illegal immigration through tougher border control, strengthened
worksite enforcement, and removal of a record numbers of criminal and
other illegal aliens. The agency has also worked to improve and tighten
the naturalization process, and has made needed reforms to our asylum syst
em for refugees fleeing persecution. While the INS has achieved progress
in these areas, the Administration recognizes the need to restructure the
agency in order to improve its AdministrationO,s ability to carry out the
nationO,s immigration laws.

In its final report to Congress last fall, the United States Commission on
Immigration Reform (CIR) called for significant reform to our nationO,s
immigration system.  The CIR criticized that the INSO,s dual
responsibility of welcoming immigrants who enter legally and deterring
those who enter illegally has resulted in O&mission overload,08 and
recommended reallocating responsibilities both within,the Department of
Justice (DOJ) and outside the agency.  The major thrust of the CIRO,s
proposed reform would move all immigration service functions to the
Department of State, and would consolidate all immigration enforcement
into a new federal law enforcement agency within the Justice Department.

In response to the CIRO,s recommendation, the President asked the Domestic
Policy Council (DPC) to O&evaluate carefully the [CIR] proposal and other
reform options designed to improve the executive branchO,s administration
of the NationO,s immigration laws.D8 In conducting this review, the DPC,
working closely with the Office of Management and Budget, consulted with
the Departments of Justice, Labor and State, the INS, staff of the CIR,
immigration experts and advocacy groups, and other White House offices,
including the National Security Council.  This review examined
organizational and restructuring options including those formulated by the
CIR and members of Congress. After the Administration established a
framework for reform, the Justice Department contracted with a management
conSUlting firm to assist in developing a plan to make this framework
O&operational.08

The AdministrationO,s Framework for Change

The CIR report correctly diagnosed many of INSO,s problems -- insufficient
accountability between field offices and headquarters, lack of consistency
and professionalism, overlapping organizational relationships, and
significant management weaknesses.  These problems have hampered the
INSO,s ability to effectively pursue the tasks that Congress and the
President expect the INS to perform: effective enforcement of our
immigration laws both at our borders and in the interior, and the
efficient provision of immigration and citizenship benefits and services.


Improving the ability of the INS to pursue these critical priorities must
be the guiding principle of any reform plan.

After careful consideration and study, the Administration concluded that
the most effective way to adhere to this guiding principle is to implement
dramatic and fundamental reforms within the INS.   The AdministrationO,s
reform plan untangles the INSO,s overlapping and frequently confusing
organizational. structure and replace it with two clear organizational
chains of command -- one for accomplishing its enforcement mission and one
for the provision of services.   Each operation would be headed by an
Executive Associate Commissioner (EAC) who would report directly to the
Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner.   This division of responsibility sets
up clear lines of authority and accountability at every functional level.

While the AdministrationO,s plan calls for separating enforcement from
services operations within the INS, it also retains essential integrating
functions for supporting and coordinating these operations.   The result
will be an INS organization wi,th strengthened accountability and improved
efficiency and effectiveness that allows each operation to focus on the
unique management, knowledge, skills, and abilities of its function.

Improved Customer-oriented services

00      Creates new local service offices.   The new immigration services
operation would locate new service offices in immigrant communities around
the country. These offices would focus on providing efficient and
effective service, while maintaining the integrity of application
processing. The offices would provide a range of services including:
providing information to applicants, taking fingerprints and photographs,
testing, an~ interviewing. Depending on community needs, some offices may
be configured as full-service centers and others could serve as satellite
locations to perform specific functions.   These new service facilities
would have a standard O&look and feel08 with clear signs, comfortable
waiting rooms, some evening and weekend hours, and other customer-friendly
features:

00      Creates stronger lines of authority and accountability.  The heads of
the local service offices would report to an Service Area Director. The
Service Area Director would report directly to the Executive Associate
commissi.oner for Immigration Services. Service Area Directors would have
the flexibility to move case processing responsibilities among offices
within their area to maximize efficiency.  Area Directors would be held
accountable for meeting a nationally-established standard for timely
processing and courteous service at all of the locations throughout the
areaO,s jurisdiction.

DO      Offers high-tech answers.   This new framework provides high-tech ways
for people to receive better service through remote service centers.     As
part of this restructuring effort, INS will re-examine the capabilities
of the four service centers that handle the automated, bulk processing
workload of the current district offices. These centers currently take
applications, create electronic records of them, and conduct the
pre-processing necessary before the examination is administered.   Under
the new structure, more clerical work would be shifted to the service
centers, thus allowing local offices to focus on core activities which
require interaction with customers.

A Strengthened and Integrated Enforcement Operation

00      Establishing a single, coordinated enforcement function.   The plan


creates an operational chain of command dedicated to immigration
enforcement.   INS can focus comprehensively on illegal immigration
problems at the border and in the interior, and create a single point of
accountability for performance. This approach will strengthen
professionalism and improve results. Also, this structure would ensure
priorities are shared and allow close coordination of day-to-day
operations among each enforcement discipline.

DO      Integrating enforcement and strengthening accountability. The new
enforcement operations areas would combine all functions related to the
enforcement of immigration laws. Each enforcement area would be organized
according to four enforcement functions, and led by a single director.
The Area Enforcement Director would report directly to the Executive
Associate Commissioner for Enforcement.

DO      Four Field Components organized by function.  The enforcement areas
would be organized around four functional goals: managing the border;
inspections and management at ports of entry; investigations and removals;
and detention.

1) Border Patrol.  The Border Patrol would,perform its current border
management functions of deterring illegal immigration, apprehending
illegal aliens, and working to dismantle smuggling rings.

2) Inspectors.   The plan recognizes the critical part the ports of entry
play in INSD,s border management strategy by putting inspectors in the
enforcement chain of command.   This would give the ports a stronger role
on the enforcement side of the agency and gives inspectors a direct
reporting relationship to the Enforcement Area Director.

3) Investigations and Removals. This plan would also bring investigators,
intelligence officers and deportation officers into one multi-disciplinary
component in order to focus on removals and pursuing cases of fraud,
smuggling and illegal employment at the workplace. Offices in the field
would be located in areas with the greatest demand for those functions--
similar to the traditional Special or Resident Agent-in Charge (SAC/RAC)
law enforcement model used by the FBI.

4) Detention and Enforcement Support. This framework would improve the
logistical coordination of transporting criminal and illegal aliens and
detaining them in long-term facilities by centralizing the current
District Office detention and transportation operations. Under the new
framework, this component would ,be better able to track open bed space at
INS and contract facilities, improve and monitor conditions at these
facilities, as well as provide appropriate access to them.

shared Support

DO      Providing the right tools.  The D&shared supportDB operation (e.g.,
records and data management, technological support, employee relations,
and administrative support) serves as the administrative and technological
backbone upon which both enforcement and service operations depend. The
goal of this operation will be to ensure that each side of the agency has
the appropriate administrative and technological tools to do their jobs.
These range from new computer software systems that are D&user-friendlyDB
for enforcement agents and service officers, to appropriate training to
strengthen professionalism.

DO      Managing essential records. An important cohesive function of the
shared support operation is the management of all of INSD,s files and


electronic databases.  The INS's records are the basis for its work --
whether law enforcement or the provision of services to customers. For exa
mple, the information contained in those records tells an INS deportation
officer that an individual has overstayed his visa and the last address at
which he might be found. It also tells an adjudicator whether a person has
ever entered without inspection, therefore jeopardizing his eligibility to
become a legal permanent resident.

New 0&Strategy08 Office

00      Eliminating overlapping functions.   The Administrationo,s proposed
structure -includes the creation of a small, new "strategy" unit that would
focus on setting priorities, designing the ways in which they can be
executed in the field, as well as analyzing the effectiveness of their
execution. The unit would use staff from headquarters, as well as create
subject area task forces to draw on the expertise of individuals
accountable for each program.

New Chief Financial Officer Role

DO      Enhancing accountability and efficiency.  The new structure also
creates a role for a new Chief Financial Officer to improve the
distribution, control, and monitoring of the agencyo,s finances. This
would enhance accountability for managing the agencyo,s resources and
ensure that immigrant services and enforcement have clearly separated and
defined revenue streams.


Other Management Improvements

INS recognizes that a profound restructuring is only one aspect of
improving its ability to build a more effective organization. As part of
its reform efforts, the agency is also planning management initiatives
such as fundamentally redesigning outdated business processes, and the
creation of new training opportunities.

Conclusion

Preserving our countryo,s tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of
immigrants requires one agency with clear, defined operational lines of
authority and accountability. This new structure will allow our Nation to
better control its borders and provide improved service and benefits to
the immigrant community.  The Administrationo,s plan is a bold initiative
to strengthen the INSo,s capacity and ability to accomplish this critical
mission.

            activities which require interaction with customers.

     A Strengthened and Integrated Enforcement Operation

           Establishing a single, coordinated enforcement function. The plan creates an operational
            chain of command dedicated to immigration enforcement.         INS can focus
            comprehensively on illegal immigration problems at the border and in the interior, and
            create a single point of accountability for performance. This approach will strengthen
            professionalism and improve results. Also, this structure would ensure priorities are shared
            and allow c1qse coordination of day-to-day operations among each enforcement discipline.

           Integrating enforcement and strengthening accountability, The new enforcement operations
            areas would combine all functions related to the enforcement of immigration laws. Each
            enforcement area would be organized according to four enforcement functions, and led
            by a single director. The Area Enforcement Director would report directly to the
            Executive Associate Commissioner for Enforcement.

           Four Field Components organized by function.   The enforcement areas would be
            organized around four functional goals: managing the border; inspections and
            management at ports of entry; investigations and removals; and detention.

            1) Border Patrol. The Border Patrol would perform its current border management
            functions of deterring illegal immigration, apprehending illegal aliens, and working to
            dismantle smuggling rings.

            2) Inspectors. The plan recognizes the critical part the ports of entry play in INS's
            border management strategy by putting inspectors in the enforcement chain of command.
             This would give the ports a stronger role on the enforcement side of the agency and
            gives inspectors a direct reporting relationship to the Enforcement Area Director.

            3) Investigations and Removals. This plan would also bring investigators, intelligence
            officers and deportation officers into one multi-disciplinary component in order to focus
            on removals and pursuing cases of fraud, smuggling and illegal employment at the
            workplace. Offices in the field would be located in areas with the greatest demand for
            those functions-- similar to the traditional Special or Resident Agent-in Charge

                                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
             (SAC/RAC) law enforcement model used by the FBI.

             4) Detention and Enforcement Support. This framework would improve the logistical
             coordination of transporting criminal and illegal aliens and detaining them in long-term
             facilities by centralizing the current District Office detention and transportation operations.
             Under the new framework, this component would be better able to track open bed space
             at INS and contract facilities, improve and monitor conditions at these facilities, as well as
             provide appropriate access to them.

      Shared Support

            Providing the right tools. The "shared support" operation (e.g., records and data
             management, technological support, employee relations, and administrative support)
             serves as the administrative and technological backbone upon which both enforcement
             and service operations depend. The goal of this operation will be to ensure that each side
             of the agency has the appropriate administrative and technological tools to do their jobs.
             These range from new computer software systems that are "user-friendly" for enforcement
             agents and service officers, to appropriate training to strengthen professionalism.

            Managing essential records.    An important cohesive function of the shared support
             operation is the management of all of INS's files and electronic databases. The INS's
             records are the basis for its work -- whether law enforcement or the provision of services
             to customers. For example, the information contained in those records tells an INS
             deportation officer that an individual has overstayed his visa and the last address at which
             he might be found. It also tells an adjudicator whether a person has ever entered without
             inspection, therefore jeopardizing his eligibility to become a legal permanent resident.

      New "Strategy" Office

            Eliminating overlapping functions.   The Administration's proposed structure includes the
             creation of a small, new "strategy" unit that would ,focus on setting priorities, designing
             the ways in which they can be executed in the field, as well as analyzing the effectiveness
             of their execution. The unit would use staff from headquarters, as well as create subject
             area task forces to draw on the expertise of individuals accountable for each program.

      New ChiefFinancial Officer Role

            Enhancing accountability and efficiency. The new structure also creates a role for a new
             Chief Financial Officer to improve the distribution, control, and monitoring of the
             agency's finances. This would enhance accountability for managing the agency's resources
             and ensure that immigrant services and enforcement have clearly separated and defined

                Other Management Improvements

                INS recognizes that a profound restructuring is only one aspect of improving its ability to build a
                more effective organization. A1; part of its reform efforts, the agency is also planning management
                initiatives such as fundamentally redesigning outdated business processes, and the creation of new
                training opportunities.

                Conclusion

                Preserving our country's tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants requires one
                agency with clear, defined operational lines of authority and accountability. This new structure
                will allow our Nation to better control its borders and provide improved service and benefits to
                the immigrant community. The Administration's plan is a bold initiative to strengthen the INS's
                capacity and ability to accomplish this critical mission.
