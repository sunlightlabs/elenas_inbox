        PRESIDENT WELCOMES MEDICARE COMMISSION AND MAKES STRONG
           COMMITMENT TO PREPARE MEDICARE FOR THE RETIREMENT
                          OF THE BABY BOOMERS
                               March 4,1998

 Today, meeting with the newly appointed Medicare Commission, the President stated his strong
 commitment to work with Chairman Breaux, Congressman Thomas, and the rest of the Commission to
 develop a bipartisan consensus for future reforms to the Medicare program that prepare it for the
 retirement of the baby boom population. In so doing, he highlighted the great achievements of
 Medicare and the important contributions that the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) made to strengthening
 and improving the program. The President indicated that he is confident the Commission can build on
 the successes oflast year's Medicare reforms and tak~ the next steps to prepare the program for the
 unprecedented demographic challenges it faces. He also urged the Commission to never forget that
 Medicare is more than just a program of policies and numbers; it is a national commitment that serves
 almost 40 million of our most vulnerable Americans.

 MEDICARE HAS BEEN ONE OF THIS CENTURY'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS--
 IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. In the last 30 years, the
 Medicare program has provided high-quality health care to millions of older Americans and people
 with disabilities. Since the program was signed into law:

    The rate of uninsured elderly has dropped from 46 percent to 1 percent. Today, about 15
     million Americans could go uninsured without Medicare's guarantee of coverage.

    Older Americans are living 20 percent longer. A 65 year old today can expect to live until the
     age of 82; whereas in 1960, a 65 year old lived on average until the age of 79. This is partly
     attributable to Medicare's expansion of needed health care coverage to older American.

    The poverty rate has dropped by over half. Medicare has contributed to decreasing poverty
     among older Americans. Today, about 11 % of people ages 65 and older are poor, compared to
     29% in 1966 .

. THE BIPARTISAN BALANCED BUDGET ACT INCLUDED UNPRECEDENTED
  MEDICARE REFORMS. One of the most important achievements of the Balanced Budget Act the
  President signed into law last summer was its unprecedented reforms to the Medicare program. This
  bipartisan effort strengthened the life of the Medicare Trust Fund for at least a decade from now,
  included new health plan choices, and added coverage of preventive benefits. It:

    Extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund for at. least a decade. Through a series of
     payment and structural reforms, the BBA extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund for at least
     a decade from today. This achievement built on the President's 1993 budget which extended the
     Trust Fund for three years.

    Contained important new preventive benefits. The Balanced Budget Act included new
     preventive benefits including annual mammograms for all Medicare beneficiaries over forty;
     regular pap smears and pelvic exams; diabetes management benefits, and regular colorectal cancer
     screening.'


   Enacted important new structural reforms. The BBA also inciuded new market-oriented
    reforms, such as adding new plan choices including Provider Sponsored Organizations, Preferred
    Provider Organizations, prospective payment system reforms, and a number of prudent purchasing
    provisions that allow Medicare to buy services in the same way private health plans do.

   Growth in line with private spending. Because of the important BBA reforms, Medicare
    growth per beneficiary will actually be slightly less than projected private insurance spending
    growth:        4 percent versus 5 percent between 1997 and 2002.

STRENGTHENING MEDICARE FOR THE RETIREMENT OF THE BABY BOOMERS.
While the Balanced Budget Act strengthened Medicare in the short term, the program will face new
challenges as the baby boomers retire. The President highlighted some of these challenges and made a
strong commitment to work with the Commission to develop consensus for long-term Medicare
reforms. The challenges include:                                                     .

   An unprecedented number of Americans will enter Medicare as the baby boom generation
    retires; The number of elderly will increase by 45 percent in the next 20 years. By 2030, one in
    five Americans will be elderly.

   The ratio of workers to Medicare beneficiaries will drop significantly by 2030. The number
    of workers per Medicare beneficiaries will decline from 3.9 to 2.3 during this period, straining the
    financing of the Medicare program, which is partly financed through a payroll tax.

The President reiterated his confidence that the Commission, working with Congress and the
Administration, will successfully meet the new challenges facing the Medicare program. He
pointed out that the American people have always been able to reach consensus to address this
extremely important program, which provides needed services to tens of millions of Americans.

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
