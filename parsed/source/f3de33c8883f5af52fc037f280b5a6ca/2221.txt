MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:          BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:       ADMINISTRATION DECISION ON TEXAS WELFARE PLAN

        Today, HHS provided the state of Texas with written guidance under which the state
could release a "request for offers" (RFO) for private contractors to operate state-wide system of
offices where residents would apply for Medicaid, food stamps, welfare, and other public
assistance. The letter recounts the options HHS and USDA offidals discussed with Texas
Health and Human Services Commissioner Michael McKinney at their meeting on May 2nd.
The Texas proposal is known as TIES, the Texas Integrated Enrollment Services project.

       The guidance notes that under current Medicaid and food stamp law:

              The state has broad authority to administer the Temporary Assistance for Needy
               Families (TANF) program, the block grant created by last year's welfare law, and
               can use private contractors without limitation there.

              The state can also use private contractors to design and operate information
               systems, develop and recommend revised eligibility processes, and provide
               training and assistance in the management of TIES.

        However, the guidance says:

              A non-public employee may not take actions involving discretion or value
               judgments, including all elements of the benefit eligibility determination process
               that relate to the evaluation of information provided by an applicant or which
               bears on the eligibility decision.

              In an integrated enrollment system, most ifnot all activities involving personal
               contact with an applicant or recipient, including data entry during an interactive
               discussion with the applicant, have the potential to involve the use of discretion or
               judgment and must be performed by state merit system employees.

Talking Points

      The welfare reform bill passed by the Congress and signed by the President allowed states
       to privatize their cash assistance programs, but did not change the law for Medicaid or
       food stamps.

      The President believes states need flexibility to make welfare what it was meant to be: a
       second chance, not a way of life, a system that helps people draw a paycheck instead of a
       welfare check. That's why he signed the welfare reform law last year in the face of much
       opposition from many in his party.

      But welfare reform should not jeopardize the national guarantee of basic nutrition and
       health care for children and families, the disabled, and the elderly.

      We're concerned that allowing a state to privatize Medicaid and food stamp operations
       will not be in the best interests of program beneficiaries.

      Current Medicaid and food stamp law makes clear that eligibility determination must be
       performed by impartial, merit-based public employees. We are not prepared to provide a
       state-wide waiver of these basic protections for seniors and families and working people
       who rely on medical and nutritional assistance.

Q&As

Question:     Haven't you blocked the state from developing an integrated enrollment
system?

Answer:       No. The state could develop an integrated enrollment system so long as public
              employees perform the essential eligibility determination functions. The state
              could issue a "request for offers" seeking private contractors for those functions
              which the law allows to be privatized -- designing and operating information
              systems, developing and recommending revised eligibility processes, and
              providing management training and assistance. The state could also privatize all
              aspects of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.

Question:     How can you claim that data entry is eligibility determination?

Answer:       Any activity which involves discretion and value judgments can affect the
              eligibility decision. In an integrated process, the person who asks the applicant

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                           4elC-Dump Conversion

 Question:    Doesn't your guidance contradict the welfare reform law signed by the
 President
              which grants states the flexibility to run their own programs?

 Answer:      No. Based on the welfare law that the President signed in August, Texas already
              has the authority to proceed now with the welfare portion of their proposal.
              However, Congress and the President retained the laws on Medicaid and food
              stamps. Our guidance to Texas is consistent with current law.

 Question:    How can you say the President supports state flexibility when he denies
 Texas'
              proposal?

 Answer:      The President has a strong record of supporting state flexibility. First, after
              granting 80 waivers to 43 states to test innovative strategies to move people from
              welfare to work, he signed the welfare law which allows states to reform welfare
              without seeking permission from Washington. The President has also granted 13
              Medicaid waivers to help states make their programs more efficient and effective.
               The President clearly supports state flexibility; however his first priority is
              protecting beneficiaries.

  Question:   Texas says it would expand health care to an additional 150,000 needy
. children
              with the savings generated from TIES. How could the President oppose
              that?

 Answer:      Obviously, the President supports expanding health care coverage to uninsured
              children -- his budget, and the budget agreement he negotiated with Congress,
              would expand coverage to 5 million more children. But he does not support
              jeopardizing health and nutritional benefits to seniors, the disabled, and families
              already on Medicaid in order to expand coverage to additional children.

 Question:    Would the Administration approve a sub-state waiver?

 Answer:      HHS and USDA officials told Texas representatives that they would consider a
              sub-state project which was time limited and had an evaluation, so we could find
              out the effects. However, Commissioner McKinney apparently indicated that the
              state was not interested in such an option.

 Question:    Didn't the President's senior advisers propose another solution -- one that

                                                                            Ht'!JC-Dump Conversion

Answer:        The President did ask us to take another look at this issue. His principal
               interest is what's best for families who rely on Medicaid and Food Stamps, and he
               wanted to make sure that the decision would be consistent with that interest.
Question:      Why did it taken the Administration so long to give Texas an answer?

Answer:        The Texas proposal is a very complicated project involving multiple federal
               programs and agencies. There were a great many legal questions to consider.
               And we wanted to make sure that the decision we reach was right and would
               protect families who rely on Medicaid and food stamps.

Question:      Isn't this just a payback to the unions?

Answer:        Obviously, the unions feel strongly about this; so does the state of Texas. We
met
               with both during the decision-making process. However, we made our decision
               based on what we think is best for the program beneficiaries.

Question:      Why do you assume that public employees are better than private ones in
               protecting the rights of beneficiaries?

Answer:        We are simply following the laws passed by Congress which are designed to let
               states seek innovative approaches to' improve the efficiency of benefit programs
               while protectin'g the rights of beneficiaries. Making decisions about the
               eligibility of needy people for benefits is one of the most fundamental functions of
               government.

Question:      Doesn't the Medicaid program now allow private contractors to enroll
individuals?

Answer:        No. Private employees, such as hospital workers, can only gather information
and
               forward it to state workers. They cannot evaluate it or make eligibility
               determinations.

Question:      Would the President support an legislative amendment to allow Texas -- and
               other states -- proceed?

Answer:        We opposed granting individual state waivers legislatively -- that authority rests in
               the executive branch. We would also oppose legisJation which would completely
               privatize or block grant Medicaid or food stamps. We would of course want to
               see the language before commenting on any particular amendment.

              !.lex-Dump Conversion
            particular proposals come back?

Answer:     We are letting the state release the RFO. But we thought it was only fair to let the
            state know what type of contracts we would approve and what type we would not
            since the exact nature of the TIES system would depend upon the terms of the
            agreement between Texas and the contractor.

Question:   We understand you're planning to let Wisconsin privatize but not Texas.
            How is that fair?

Answer:     We have not responded to Wisconsin's request. However, their proposal is very
            different from Texas' -- it would allow private contractors for food stamps in only
            a limited number counties, in a time limited demonstration which would be
            independently evaluated.
