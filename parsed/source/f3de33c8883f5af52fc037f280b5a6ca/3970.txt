          President Clinton Continues to Fight to Improve the Health of Our Nation's Children


   Children and Prescription Drug Testing. Today's announcement requiring manufacturers to do studies
    on pediatric populations for new prescription drugs and those currently on the market builds on an
    impressive array of children's initiatives advocated by President Clinton.

   Children and Insurance Coverage. The President fought hard to ensure that the Balanced Budget Act
    included $24 billion -- the largest investment in children's health care since the passage of Medicaid in
    1965 -- to provide meaningful health care coverage to as many as five million of our nation's uninsured
    children. He also fought to include revenue from a 20 cent tobacco tax which will not only further
    reduce the number of uninsured children, but it will also serve as a f"mancial barrier to help prevent
    our children from starting to smoke in the f"rrst place.

   Children and Tobacco. The President issued guidelines to eliminate easy access to tobacco products and
    to prohibit companies from advertising tobacco to kids. Each day about three thousand children become
    regular smokers and 1,000 of them will die from a tobacco-related illness. According to former FDA
    Commissioner David Kessler, the possibility of a comprehensive, public health oriented settlement with the
    tobacco industry could not have come about without the President's leadership in this area.

   Children and Insurance Reform. By signing the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill into law last year, the
    President helped millions of American children keep their health care coverage when their parents lose or
    change jobs.
   Children and Juvenile Diabetes. The President fought to include $150 million ($30 million annually
                                                                                for five years) for research
                                                                                to help f"md the cure for
                                                                                diabetes. Americans with
                                                                                this disease often suffer

   Children and Immunization. As the President recently announced, over 90 percent of America's
    toddlers in 1996 received the most critical doses of each of the routinely recommended vaccines --
    surpassing the goal set by the President in 1993.

   Children and the Environment. Earlier this year, the President signed an Executive Order to reduce
    environmental health and safety risks to children by requiring agencies to strengthen policies and improve
    research to protect children and ensure that new regulations consider special risks to children.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
   Children and Medicaid. Throughout his Administration, the President has fought to preserve and
    strengthen the Medicaid program; its coverage of about 20 million children, makes it the largest single
    insurer of children. The Administration has partnered with states through Medicaid waivers to expand
    coverage to hundreds of thousands of children.

                           PEDIATRIC LABELING Qs and As


Q:   WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS REGULATION NOW?

A:   Despite efforts to increase the number of studies on pediatric populations, still too many
     children take prescription drugs that have not been tested on children. Over 80
     percent of drugs manufactured in the United States have not been tested on children
     and over 50 percent of drugs that are known to be widely tested in children have not
     been tested.

     As a result, some physicians are reluctant to prescribe much-needed therapies to
     children. Physicians report that they have denied children important new drugs
     because, in the absence of adequate testing and labeling, they would have to guess at
     an appropriate dosage, and they do not want to take that risk.

     In some cases, guessing can be extremely dangerous. One example of the possible
     harm is the case of "gray baby syndrome" where a number of babies died from
     chloramphenicol, an antibiotic that their immature livers were unable to accept.
     Other children have had withdrawal symptoms from prolonged administration of
     fentanyl, a pain killer used as an adjunct to anesthesia in infants and small children.
      Still others have suffered seizures and cardiac arrest from bupivacaine, a local
     anaesthetic not adequately tested in pediatric populations.


Q:   CAN'T YOU ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT THROUGH VOLUNTARY
     COMPLIANCE?

A:   FDA has already implemented reforms to encourage voluntary compliance. However, as
     80 percent of drugs manufactured in the United States and over 50 percent of drugs
     widely used in children still do not have a adequate pediatric labeling, FDA has
     concluded that this new rule is necessary to ensure that children get the protection they
     need.


Q:   GIVEN THAT THE DRAFT FDA REFORM LEGISLATION, PENDING IN
          CONGRESS, CONTAINS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE
     VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE, WHY IS THIS RULE NECESSARY?

A:   The Congressional approach, while thoughtful and worthy of serious consideration,
     would not assure that most or all of prescription drugs used by children are tested and
     labeled appropriately. We believe that the DoddlDewine legislation has the potential to
     complement the regulation the President is unveiling today, but it is not a replacement for
     it.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

 Q:   DO YOU SUPPORT THE DODD LEGISLATION AS CURRENTLY DRAFfED
      AS A COMPONENT OF THIS EFFORT?

A:    We are reviewing this legislation to detennine ifit can be designed to compliment and
      bolster our efforts today. We believe that it has great potential to compliment the
      legislation but we are not prepared to accept it as currently drafted before we consider all
      of the ramifications of overlaying the important regulation the President is announcing
      today.


Q:    HAVE CHILDREN BEEN AT RISK IN THE PAST?

A:    Yes. In some cases physicians do not prescribe drugs because they determine that
      it is simply not worth taking the risk of prescribing drugs that have not been tested
      in children.

      In other cases, physicians choose to prescribe treatment, because it is the only means
      to cure a child's nagging illness or even a life threatening disease. Those physicians
      are left to make their best guess at the appropriate doses - rather than rely on the
      through studies and information that the rest of us take for granted.

      In some cases, however, guessing can be devastating. One example of the potential
      for harm is the case of "gray baby syndrome" where a number of babies died from
      chloramphenicol, an antibiotic that their immature livers were unable to accept.
      Other children had withdrawal symptoms from prolonged administration of
      fentanyl, a pain killer used as an adjunct to anesthesia in infants and small children.
       Still others have suffered seizures and cardiac arrest from bupivacaine, a local
      anaesthetic not adequately tested in pediatric popUlations.


Q:    HOW MANY PRODUCTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE RULE?

A:    FDA anticipates that this will impact about 12 new drugs each year. The agency will
      also review drugs already on the market to detennine which ones should have pediatric
      studies. FDA will work as quickly as possible to ensure that in a few years the drugs
      most important to children will have directions for use in kids on their labels.

Q:    WHAT KINDS OF DRUGS ARE COMMONLY MISSING THIS PEDIATRIC
      DATA?

A:    Drugs such as anti-asthmatics, steroids, drugs to treat gastrointestinal problems, strong
             pain medications, antidepressants, and antihypertensives commonly lack
      appropriate pediatric labeling.

Q:   WHAT DO DOCTORS DO WHEN THEY DON'T                       Hl%IfH1sC'f:rWb~TION?
A:   In some cases they choose not to prescribe the drugs at all. In other cases, they take their
     best guess -- without the assistance of information that we rely on for adult medications.
     Sometime, however, guessing can have dangerous consequences, such as seizures, heart
     problems, or even death.


Q:   WHEN CAN PARENTS EXPECT THAT INFORMATION TO SUPPORT SAFE
     AND EFFECTIVE USE OF PRODUCTS IN CHILDREN WILL BECOME
     AVAILABLE?

A:   We believe that, in some cases, the information already exists and the drug companies
             merely need to analyze and compile it. In these cases, the information can be
     made available on the labeling of the products fairly quickly. In other cases, studies need
     to be conducted. Under the requirements of FDA's 1994 regulation, where the effects of
     the product and the disease for which it is indicated are sufficiently similar in both adults
     and children, these studies can be done within one year.


Q:   HOW MUCH WILL THIS COST DRUG MANUFACTURERS?

A:   FDA estimates that the costs of pediatric studies will be less than 1% of the total costs of
     developing a drug.

Q:   WILL DRUG PRICES INCREASE AS A RESULT OF THIS REGULATION?

A:   Because the cost of pediatric studies to manufacturers is expected to be small, it is
           anticipated that there will be little or no price increases to patients.

Q:   WILL THIS REQUIREMENT HOLD UP DRUG APPROVALS?

A:   Clearly we will provide every incentive to complete the study before the drug is
     approved. However, the rule explicitly ensures that a drug's entrance into the market is
     not held up even if all studies on pediatric populations have not yet begun. We will rely
     on other legal and financial remedies to ensure that companies comply as soon as
     possible.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
Q:   WHEN WILL THIS REGULATION GO INTO EFFECT?

A:   There is a 90 day period for comment on the proposed rule after which the agency will
             evaluate and respond to the comments and publish a final rule. The final rule will
     take effect 3 months after issuance. At that time, for drugs already on the market, FDA,
     in compelling circumstances, may request that pediatric studies be initiated.
     Manufacturers of new drug and biologic products, under review at the agency, will have 2
     years to comply with the pediatric study requirement. Manufacturers of new products,
     not yet submitted for review, will have 18 months to comply with the requirement.
     Drugs already on the marketplace will have 3 months to comply.


Q:   WHAT IS THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM FDA WILL TAKE TO FORCE
     COMPANIES TO PROVIDE THIS DATA ON APPROVED DRUGS?

A:   FDA can go to court and ask the court to order the company to comply with the
           regulations. If the company does not comply, the court can impose penalties.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

      PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW MEASURES TO INCREASE
    AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION ON SAFE USE OF MEDICATIONS USED
                         TO TREAT CHILDREN
                            August 13, 1997

Today, President Clinton unveiled a new FDA regulation that will protect children by requiring
manufacturers to study the safety and appropriate dosage levels of drugs for pediatric
populations. The regulation also requires proper labeling of drugs for use in children. Even
though many drugs affect children differently than adults, most drugs have not been tested on
pediatric populations. Under this rule, manufacturers of prescription drugs likely to be used by
children will be required to complete studies and place information on drug labels to help
pediatricians and other health care providers make scientifically-based treatment decisions when
prescribing drugs to children.

WHY THIS REGULATION IS NEEDED

Most drugs -- even those commonly used in children -- have not been widely tested on pediatric
populations. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only a small fraction of drugs
and biological products marketed in the United States have had clinical trials performed in
pediatric patients. Despite evidence that drugs affect children differently than adults, 80 percent
of all drugs marketed in the United States have been labeled for use by infants, children, and
adolescents. Forty-two percent of drugs that are widely used in pediatric populations have been
tested on children.

      Many drugs commonly given to children under the age of six including Prozac, Zoloft,
       Ritalin, and drugs for asthma, allergic reactions, and ear infections are inadequately tested
       and labeled for use in children. These drugs, taken together, are given to over five million
       children each year.

      Less than half of the drugs used in the treatment of HIV infections carry any safety or
       effectiveness information for children. Of those that do, the data is often incomplete.

      Safety and effectiveness information is especially sparse for the over seven million children
       under the age of two.

      The percentage of drugs being tested on children decreased by over one-third between
       1996 and 1991.

Drugs are likely to have a different impact on children than on adults. The appropriate use and
dosage levels of medication for children and adults is usually different because of disparities in
organs, the immune system, and metabolism.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion


Children who take prescription drugs that have not been tested on pediatric populations are at serious
risk for unexpected adverse reactions. Evidence suggests that prescribing drugs that have not been
adequately tested on children can be extremely dangerous. One example of the possible harm is
the case of "gray baby syndrome" where a number of babies died from chloramphenicol, an
antibiotic that their immature livers were unable to accept. Other children had withdrawal
symptoms from prolonged administration of fentanyl, a pain killer used as an adjunct to
anesthesia in infants and small children. Still others have suffered seizures and cardiac arrest
from bupivacaine, a local anaesthetic not adequately tested in pediatric populations.

Some physicians are reluctant to prescribe much needed therapies to children because they have not
been tested on pediatric populations. Physicians report that they have denied children important
new drugs because, in the absence of adequate testing and labeling, they would have to guess at
an appropriate dosage, and they do not want to take that risk. As a result, too many children do
not receive the treatment they need and deserve.

SUMMARY OF THE RULE

Pediatric Studies for New Drugs. Under this proposed rule, manufacturers of new drugs would
have to do studies on pediatric populations under two circumstances: when the product
represents a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments; or when the product is
expected to be widely used on pediatric patients. The FDA anticipates that about twelve new
drugs each year would meet this requirement. Manufacturers could receive waivers from the
requirement to do a pediatric study under anyone of the following circumstances:

(I)    The product does not represent meaningful benefits over existing treatments and is not
       likely to be used on a substantial number of pediatric patients as a whole; or

(2)    Necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical-- i.e., the number of patients is too
       small or geographically, diverse; or

(3)    There is evidence strongly suggesting that the product would be unsafe or ineffective in
       pediatric populations.

Pediatric Studies For Existing Drugs. For drugs that are already on the market, the new FDA
regulation requires additional testing on the pediatric population only if there is a "compelling
need for more information." The criteria used is:

(I)    If the product is widely used in pediatric populations and the absence of adequate labeling
       could pose significant risks to pediatric populations; or
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conver.s~on
(2)   If the product is indicated for very significant or life threatening illness, but addJ.tlonal
      dosing or safety information is needed to permit its safe and effective use in pediatric
      patients.
