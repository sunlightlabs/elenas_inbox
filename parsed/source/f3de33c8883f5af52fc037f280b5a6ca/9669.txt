I've revised to delete statement that citizen children of illegal
immigrant parents are increasing, and instead just listed examples of
child only cases. HHS has not been able to confirm which types of child
only cases are increasing. Data on type of case are not readily
available, but based on what is available, they think this type of case is
probably not growing significantly, at least on a national basis.  If they
happen to get more information by the time we send in this memo I'll
revise again.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:           Bruce Reed                                            Automated Records Management System

SUBJECT:        Minority Welfare Caseloads

       You asked us to evaluate recent reports that African-American and Hispanic families are
leaving welfare more slowly than whites, and to consider what more we could do to ensure all
welfare recipients are making the successful transition from welfare to work. Here is a brief
summary of the trends, along with some new ideas we are developing for consideration in your
FY 2000 budget.

     I. Caseload Trends

       We have worked closely with NEC, CEA, OMB, HHS, and the Census Bureau to
examine the most recent welfare caseload data (generally through 1997). As detailed in the
attached tables, the data show:

1.       Most of the changes in the welfare caseload can be attributed to changes in the
         composition of the population as a whole -- specifically, popUlation growth explains
         nearly two-thirds of the difference in caseload decline between Hispanics and whites and
         nearly half the difference between blacks and whites.

        Since 1994, the number of welfare cases has indeed dropped more among whites (26
percent) than among blacks (18 percent) and Hispanics (9 percent). However, when population
growth is taken into account, the difference narrows dramatically. The rate of welfare
dependency has dropped sharply for all populations -- by 26 percent among whites, 21 percent
among blacks, and 20 percent among Hispanics. In other words, minorities are leaving or
staying off welfare at nearly the same rate as whites, but make up a larger share of the welfare
popUlation because they make up a larger share ofthe population as a whole. [See Table 1.]

2.       The difference in caseload decline is even narrower among adults. Since 1994, the adult
         rate of welfare dependency has declined by 30% among whites, 26% among blacks, and
         24% among Hispanics.

        Child-only cases -- which are decreasing more slowly, because they are not significantly
affected by welfare reform efforts to move recipients from welfare to work -- are
disproportionately minority. (Fer example, The child-only caseload includes aH: iaereasiag
oomaer sf citizen children born to illegal immigrants, children whose parents receive SSJ, and

        ChaBges in welfare easeload eOHlposition hfr¥e generally mirrored overall dernographie
ehanges oyer the last 25 years. The composition of the welfare caseload has changed gradually
over time, largely driven by population changes. The composition ofthe adult caseload has not
changed significantly since 1994; the most recent national data shows it is now 37 percent white,
37 percent black, and 21 percent Hispanic. [See Table 3.]

3.       There is encouraging evidence that the employment rates of minority welfare recipients
         are catching up with the employment rate for whites. Between 1996 and 1998, the
         percentage of all prior year welfare recipients who were employed in the next year
         increased by 28%. The increase was highest for Hispanics (49%), followed by blacks
         (44%) and whites (5%). [See Table 4.]

4.      Recent trends in marriage and teen illegitimacy rates could exacerbate the increasing
        proportion of Hispanic families on welfare. While the proportion of never-married
        single mothers is increasing for the entire population, the rate of increase is largest for
        Hispanic women. Also, the birth rate to unmarried teenagers is increasing for Hispanics
        while declining for whites and blacks. [See Table 5.]

5.       The real challenge will be breaking the cycle of welfare for long-term recipients, who are
         disproportionately minority.

        Minorities are more likely than whites to be on welfare in the first place, and more likely
to end up as long-term recipients once they go on the rolls. Blacks and Hispanics on welfare
tend to have lower educational levels, marriage rates, and larger families than whites, and are
more than twice as likely to live in central cities and areas of concentrated poverty. Hispanics
also have less recent work history than whites or blacks. [See Table 6.]


     II. What We Can Do

        We will continue to monitor caseload trends and keep you informed. While initial press
reports may have overstated disparities so far, these data underscore the importance of focusing
our efforts on the hardest cases, who are disproportionately minority. Many of our existing
welfare-to-work initiatives already target this population, but we also are developing some new·
proposals for your consideration in next year's budget.

        A. Current Initiatives

        As you know, you have put forward many initiatives to help the hardest-to-serve welfare
recipients and those living in concentrated areas of poverty. Many of these initiatives were
implemented in 1998, too late to influence 1994-1997 trends outlined above.

         ·      The $3 Billion Welfare-to-Work Fund you fought for in the Balanced Budget Act


                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dwnp Conversion

              is designed specifically to help long-term welfare recipients (and non-custodial
              parents) in high-poverty areas obtain jobs and move up a career ladder. While it
              is too early to have demographic data on the individuals served by these funds, the
              distribution formula and individual eligibility criteria ensure that most of these
              funds will be spent on minorities. The first of these funds were awarded in
              January 1998 and are just now starting to provide individual services.

       ·      Welfare to Work Transportation Funds enacted in the TEA-21 transportation
              reauthorization bill will help welfare recipients and low-income workers get to
              where the jobs are, often in suburban areas not served by public transportation.
              The law guarantees $50 million this coming year, and we're urging the
              appropriators to provide a total of $1 00 million.

       ·      Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers we've proposed will help families in isolated
              urban or rural areas move closer to job opportunities. Congress has funded our
              request for 50,000 vouchers. The population ofthose who currently receive
              housing assistance is 38 percent black, 10 percent Hispanic, and 46 percent white.

       ·      Community Empowerment Initiatives. The Administration's Community
              Empowerment initiatives -- empowerment zones, enterprise communities,
              Brownfields, CDFls -- will spur economic development and job creation in
              distressed neighborhoods and help address the geographic isolation faced by
              minorities on welfare.

       B. New Initiatives

        In preparation for next year's budget, we are developing a number of options to address
the particular challenges faced by minorities in making the transition from welfare to work:

       ·      Increasing Investments in English-Language and Literacy Training. We hope to
              recommend targeted new investments in two areas that directly affect minority
              and long-term recipients: learning English and learning to read. This could be
              done by expanding existing Department of Education adult education programs,
              or better yet, by dedicating Welfare-to-Work funds for job-related literacy and
              ESL programs, provided either in the workplace or by community organizations
              preparing individuals for employment.

       ·      Expanding Work-Related Drug Treatment. Since many of those remaining on
              welfare suffer from drug or alcohol dependencies, we are exploring ways to
              provide drug treatment for those who agree to go to work.

       ·      Targeting Welfare-to-Work Funds to the Toughest Areas. While the current
              Welfare-to-Work formula favors high-poverty areas, we are going to examine

                                                            Automated Records Management SY~l~.
                                                            l{ex-Dump Conversion
                                                                               1illlto Ownp Conversion        4

                  whether the funds could be even more targeted.

         ·        Increasing Work and Child Support Among Noncustodial Fathers. We may be
                  able to attract bipartisan support for an effort to help states increase the
                  employment and child support payments of noncustodial parents.

Table 1: Population-Adjusted Change in Rate ofWe1fare Dependency

Since 1994, the number of welfare cases has dropped more among whites (26 percent) than
among blacks (18 percent) and Hispanics (9 percent). However, when population growth is
taken into account, the difference narrows dramatically. The rate of welfare dependency has
dropped sharply for all populations -- by 26 percent among whites, 21 percent among blacks, and
20 percent among Hispanics. Specifically, population growth explains nearly two-thirds of the
difference in caseload decline between Hispanics and whites and nearly half the difference
between blacks and whites.

 * National data is only available through June 1997. We do not yet have more recent data, or state-specific data,
that we consider accurate. In July, The New York Times reported more recent data provided by some states, but
HHS believes that data, particularly for New York and California, may contain significant reporting errors due to
states implementation of the new T ANF data reporting system.

** The trends in population aged 15-49 is used here because this is the population group most likely to be a welfare
head of household, whose race/ethnicity would be counted when tallying the case demographics.

Table 2: Population-Adjusted Adult Rate of Decline

The difference in caseload decline among groups is even narrower for adults. Child-only cases
are decreasing more slowly than the overall welfare caseload and are disproportionately minority;
in fact, between 1994 and 1997 they increased (though they declined slightly between 1996 and
1997). Child-only cases are those in which the parent or adult is not part of the case, e.g., adult
is not a citizen but the child is; child is being cared for by a relative who is not part of the case,

parent receives SSI rather than welfare. Therefore, child-only cases are not significantly affected
by welfare to work efforts. After adjusting for population growth, the rate of welfare
dependency for adults (percent of 15-49 year old population on welfare) has declined 30% among
whites, 26% among blacks, and 24% among Hispanics.

The composition of the welfare caseload have changed gradually over the past 25 years, driven
largely by population changes. Despite differing rates of caseload decline since 1994, the
composition of the adult welfare caseload has remained relatively constant.

Table 4: Employment Rate of Welfare Recipients

There is encouraging evidence that the employment rates of minority welfare recipients (people
on welfare in one year who were working the following year) is catching up with the employment
rate for whites.

Table 5: Trends in Marriage Rates and Births

The trends in marriage rates and births to unmarried women could exacerbate the increasing
proportion of Hispanic families on welfare. While the proportion of never-married single
mothers is increasing for the entire population, the rate of increase is largest for Hispanic women.


                                               1992                  1997              % Change

Also, the birth rate to unmarried teenagers remains much higher for blacks and Hispanics than
for whites. While the rate is decreasing for blacks and slightly for whites, it continues to
increase for Hispanics. For example, between 1991 and 1996, the rate of births to unmarried
teenagers decreased 18% for blacks and 4% for whites, but increased 3% for Hispanics.


Table 6: Characteristics of Minorities on the Caseload

 Minorities on welfare are more likely to have characteristics associated with long-term welfare
recipiency. Blacks and Hispanics on welfare tend to have lower educational levels, marriage
rates, and larger families than whites, and are more than twice as likely to live in central cities
and areas of concentrated poverty. Hispanics also have less recent work history than whites or
blacks.

Minorities are more likely to be long-term welfare recipients. For example, in 199720 percent
of blacks on welfare had been on the rolls for at least five continuous years, compared to 19
