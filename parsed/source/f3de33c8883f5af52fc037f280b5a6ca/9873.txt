TEXT:
Here is the scheduling memo with the items we discussed.  The additional
ideas from the team leaders that are not reflected in the memo are:
1) Jose has an idea for a Brady/lnsta Check Event when the new regs go
into effect on Nov. 30., and for the President to release new guidelines
allowing states to use 10% of their prison funds for drug testing and
treatment (as he called for one year ago.)
2) Sarah B. suggested we do an antibiotic "super bug" initiative
announcement, and
3) Mike Cohen suggested that we propose a Math initiative that the Dept.
of Ed is working on that would increase Math tutors - to complement our
efforts to encourage more reading tutors.

Please let me know if you would like me to include those or anything else
in the memo.   Also, the teacher quality report will not be ready until
January -- do you want to keep it in the memo for the sake of discussion?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

       CC:               MARIA ECHAVESTE
                         ANN LEWIS
                         STEPHANIE STREETT

FROM:                     BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:                  POSSIBLE POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS


Following is a list of possible DPC announcements the President could make during the months
of November and December.

CRIME:
November 22 FBI Crime Statistics
            The final 1997 FBI Unified Crime Report data will be released on November 22,
            demonstrating further that crime has decreased dramatically under the President's
            watch. The President is scheduled to have the day off on Monday, November 23,
            but he could issue a written statement on Sunday or make a statement on Monday.

December      Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative
              The President could highlight the success of his innovative Youth Crime Gun
              Interdiction Initiative (YCGII), which has been ongoing for two years in 27 cities,
              by announcing: (1) the release of the second annual report on the YCGII, which
              will provide new data on guns used in crimes and demonstrate the success of the
              YCGII; (2) the availability of funds to hire new ATF agents to investigate gun
              trafficking in these 27 cities; and (3) a proposal to dramatically expand the YCGII
              to 20 new cities which was just provided for in the recent omnibus appropriations
              bill.

WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES:
November Title IX Executive Order
         The President could sign an executive order as early as next week prohibiting
         discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex in education
         programs conducted by the federal government. This includes schools operated
         by the Defense Department for military dependents, schools operated by the
         Department ofthe Interior for Native Americans, and numerous training and
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
              educational programs run by federal departments. This is a follow up to an
              Executive Memorandum the President issued last year asking the Department of
              Justice to lead an effort to identify all federally-conducted education programs and
              to recommend appropriate action to end discrimination.

December      New Child Care Data
              The President could announce new data on the number of children served with
              child care assistance through the Child Care and Development Block Grant
              (CCDBG). The data is expected to indicate that approximately 1.8 million
              children of the 10 million eligible for assistance have been served through the
              block grant. This is the first data to examine the block grant, which was created
              in the 1996 welfare reform bill, and it will highlight the need for increased
              investment in the block grant.

HEALTH:
December      Asthma Initiative
              The President could announce a concerted fight against asthma, which has
              become a national epidemic impacting the lives of 15 million Americans. The
              initial goals of this program will be to halt the increase in asthma, reduce by half
              the number of children who die or suffer activity limitations because of this
              disease, and limit the disproportionate impact of asthma on minority communities.
               The President could announce new FY2000 budget proposals to expand
              programs that have had demonstrated success on a pilot basis in preventing,
              managing, and understanding asthma. The President could also release an
              interagency report on best practices and strategies to address asthma.

December 2-4 Meeting with Presidential Task Force on People with Disabilities
             The President could meet with the Presidential Task Force on People with
             Disabilities and formally announce his endorsement of the Kennedy-Jeffords bill.
             The President could also possibly announce at this time new budget proposals
             effecting people with disabilities, including; (I) a tax credit for people with
             disabilities returning to work; (2) a long term care tax credit; and (3) a bridge
             program to help people with disabilities go to work.

WELFARE:
November       Food Stamp Fraud Directives
              The President could sign three directives to crack down on food stamp fraud:
              (1) The President would direct the Social Security Administration to share its
              death records with the Food Stamp agency to ensure that Food Stamp
              recipients who die are immediately removed from the rolls; (2) The President
              would direct USDA to develop a plan to create an interstate matching system
              to ensure Food Stamp recipients are not receiving benefits in multiple states;
              and (3) The President would direct Treasury to collect (through offset of
              federal payments and other means) unpaid fines owed by retailers that have
              violated Food Stamp rules, such as exchanging Food Stamps for cash. The
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

              first two directives will build on the Lugar legislation that passed at the end
              of the session.

December      Work Participation Rates
              The President could visit a welfare-to-work program and announce: (1) new state
              work participation rates, showing that almost all states are meeting the welfare
              law's single-parent requirements, but some are failing to meet the law's separate
              two-parent requirement; (2) new caseload data showing continuing declines; and
              (3) new data on the number of people who were on welfare in 1997 and working
              in March 1998.

December      Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers
              The Congress approved in the V AIHUD appropriations bill full funding for the
              President's request for 50,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers. The President
              could hold an event announcing the opening of the first competition for these
              vouchers. This is the first time ever that housing vouchers will be linked to
              welfare reform, and represents an improvement in the way welfare, employment,
              and housing agencies can wqrk together.

EDUCATION:
November or Afterschool Grants
January     The Congress fully funded the President's request for $200 million for afterschool
            programs. Anytime after November 4, the President could announce the release
            of the first $40 million in 21st Century Learning Center Grants for over 100
            school districts throughout the country. Another option would be to wait until
            January when the President would be able to announce the $40 million in grants
            and the opening of the competition for the remainder of the money.

December      Teacher Quality Report
              The National Center on Educational Statistics at the Department of Education has
              conducted a rapid response survey of teachers as well as an analysis of state
              efforts to improve the quality of the teaching force that will be included in the
              Department's first biennial teacher quality report. The President would announce
              the release ofthis report and possibly announce new budget and legislative
              proposals to improve teacher quality.

December      Social Promotions Report
              The President could announce a new Education Department report on best
              practices for ending social promotion. This would be an opportunity for the
              President to renew his call made this year to end social promotion.

November      AmeriCorps
              The President could reschedule the ceremony for him to swear-in the 100,000th
              Americorps member. At this event the President would also announce: (1) new
              grants to support 500-1000 Americorps Promise Fellowships to support the goals

                 set at the Presidents' Summit; (2) the recipients of the President's Service
                 Awards, the nation's highest volunteer service award; and (3) the recipients of the
                 President's Student Service Awards.

    EMPOWERMENT ZONES:
    December Empowerment Zone Awards
             The President could announce the winners of the nationwide competition for the
             second round Empowerment Zones. Twenty communities will win designations
             as new EZs -- 15 urban and 5 rural. Like the first round, each EZ will receive a
             mixture of tax incentives and flexible grants to leverage private, non-profit, and
             state and local government resources to promote business development and job
             creation in some of our country's most distressed communities. The EZ statute
             requires thatthese designations be made by January 1, 1999. The EZ program is
             one of the cornerstones of the President's and Vice President's Community
             Empowerment Agenda.
