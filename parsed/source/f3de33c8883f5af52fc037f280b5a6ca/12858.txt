Today at the first-ever White House Conference on Mental Health, chaired by the President's Mental
Health Advisor Tipper Gore, the Clinton/Gore Administration is unveiling unprecedented steps to
improve mental health. The Administration's proposals are addressing parity, improving treatment,
bolstering research, and improving community responses to help those with mental illnesses. Highlights
of these initiatives include:

   Assuring that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) -- the nation's largest
    private insurer - implements full mental health and substance abuse parity. Today the Office
    of Personnel Management is sending a letter to the 285 participating health plans informing them
    that starting next year they will have to offer full mental health and substance abuse parity to
    participate in the program. This step will provide full parity for nine million beneficiaries by next
    year and assure the Federal government leads the way to providing parity. The Department of Labor
    is also launching a new outreach campaign to inform Americans about their rights under the Mental
    Health Parity Act of 1996.

   Launching national school safety training program for teachers and educational personnel.
    The President announced a major nationwide public/private partnership between the Departments of
    Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services and the National Education Association (NEA),
    EchoStar, and other partners to improve school safety. The partnership will create and run a
    comprehensive program that will be available at the beginning of the new school year with the goal
    of reaching every school across the country and providing training to teachers, school personnel,
    and community members on how to improve school safety. The partnership will provide both
    lesson plans for educational and community members working to make schools safer and the
    technology for schools to receive the new materials. (Bruce Reviewing)

   Improving progress in research. In July, The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) will
    launch a $7.3 million landmark study to determine the nature of mental illness and treatment
    nationwide and to help guide strategies and policy for the next century. This new study will get
    information on mental illness, including the prevalence and duration of mental illness as well as the
    types of treatment that are most commonly used. NIMH also announced that this fall they will
    launch two new clinical trials, investing a total of$61 million. to build on effective treatments for
    those affected by mental illness.

   Encouraging states to offer more coordinated Medicaid services for people with mental
    illness. Millions of Americans with severe mental illness rely on Medicaid to pay for their physical
    health and mental health care. To encourage states to make the most effective services available,
    the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) will advise all state Medicaid directors that: (1)
    Medicaid will reimburse for services provided in Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) programs
    targeting people with people with the most severe and persistent mental illness; (2) Medicaid
    recipients all have access to medications that have been approved by FDA for the treatment of
    serious mental illnesses; and (3) states should educate Medicaid providers and beneficiaries about
    the existence of advance planning directives for individuals who may be incapacitated in the future
    and unable to control their care.

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
   Launching a pilot program to help people with mental illness get the quality treatment they
    need to return to work. Ofthe 4.7 million Americans that receive Social Security Disability
    Insurance (SSDI), the Social Security Administration (SSA) estimates that approximately one in
    nine has an affective mood disorder. Research suggests that many of these affective disorders cases
    could be effectively treated and perhaps could return to work. The Administration will launch a
    new 5-year, $10 million demonstration to provide treatment for SSDI beneficiaries with affective
    disorders. This complements the Roth-Moynihan-Jeffords-Kennedy legislation that allows people to
    buy into the Medicaid or Medicare program when they return to work.

   Educating older Americans and their health professionals about the risks for depression. Five
    million Americans over the age of 65 suffer from some form of depression, but many do not
    recognize their symptoms as depression and do not receive the treatment they need. NIMH and the
    Administration on Aging (AoA) will launch an outreach initiative to educate the elderly and their
    healthcare professionals that they may be at risk for or suffer from a mental illness. The Department
    of Veteran Affairs will also launch six new study sites to test two modes of primary care for aging
    persons with mental health and/or substance abuse disorders.

   Reaching out to the vulnerable homeless Americans with mental illnesses. The Department of
    Housing and Urban Development is launching a new initiative to encourage communities to create
    safe havens-where homeless mentally ill Americans can get treatment and care, including a new
    satellite conference for communities to learn strategies to create these safe havens. HHS will also
    launch a 2-year, $4.8 million grant program to study the treatment, housing, education/training and
    support services that will impact as many as 2,000 homeless mothers and their 4,000 children, many
    of whom suffer from mental illnesses. The Department of Veteran Affairs will double the number
    of "stand downs" events to reach out to homeless Americans with mental illness to help them get
    the treatment and services they need. Finally, to assure that people with mental illness are treated
    fairly in housing HUD will require all employees and grantees to participate in three training and
    awareness sessions led by Secretary Cuomo.

   Implementing new strategies to the mental health needs of crime victims. To assure that part of
    any comprehensive response to community crises, such as acts of terrorism or mass violence,
    includes a strong mental health component, the Administration is announcing a new interagency
    partnership between the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime and the Center for
    Mental Health Services within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
    (SAMSHA). This also includes appointing someone within the Emergency Disaster Relief Branch
    ofSAMHSA to work with DOl to assure that there is a strategy in place to address the mental
    health needs of victims offederal crime.

   Developing and implementing new strategies to address mental illness in the criminal justice
    system. SAMHSA and DOJ are hosting a conference later this summer to focus on how all aspects
    of the criminal justice system can better address the needs ofinentally ill offenders and prevention
    model strategies. Following this conference, DOJ will launch an outreach efforts to educate the
    criminal justice community on how to better serve people with mental health needs, which includes
    a new partnership with the National GAINS center so that communities interested in pursuing these
    approaches can get technical assistance and ideas about how to implement successful strategies.

   Implementing a new comprehensive approach to address combat stress in the military. At
    least 30 percent of those who have spent time in war zones experience post traumatic stress
    disorder. Today the President directed the Department of Defense to report back within 180 days on
                                                   2
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

    an implementation plan for a comprehensive combat stress program throughout the military. DOD
    will also hold a conference this fall to develop strategies and educate military leaders and medical
    personnel about the need to enhance current practices.

   Launching the expansion of the "Caring For Every Child" mental health campaign. At least
    one in ten American children and adolescents may have behavioral, emotional or mental health
    problems. The Administration will launch a five year $5 million campaign to help reduce stigma in
    targeted communities by highlighting the special mental health needs of children.

   Improving the mental health of Native American youth. The suicide rate for Native Americans
    between the ages of 5-24 years old is three times higher than the rest of the U.S. population in this
    age group. This initiative allocates at least $5 million for a collaboration between the Departments
    of Interior, Justice, Education, HHS., and Tribes that will go to ten Native American communities to
    develop effective strategies to address mental health needs of youth in settings such as the home,
    school, treatment centers, and the juvenile justice system.

   Launching a national mental health and medical/surgical care integration strategy. VA will
    provide mental health assessment and care to veterans served by medical primary care teams and
    that medical assessment and care is available to veterans served by mental health primary care
    teams. Clinicians will be trained in the issues and methods involved in integration of mental health
    and medical services.

   The Administration Also Challenged Congress to Pass Legislation to Improve Care and
    Services for People with Mental Illness. The Administration urged Congress to:
    ~ Fund the historic $70 million increase in the mental health grant and to call on the states to also
       renew their commitment to providing mental health proposals.
    ~ Pass a strong enforceable patients' bill of rights which assures that people with mental health
       needs obtain critical protections such as the access to specialists and the continuity of such care
       protections.
    ~ Pass strong comprehensive privacy and legislation to eliminate genetic discrimination.
    ~ Pass the Roth-Moynihan-Jeffords-Kennedy legislation, which would enable people with
       disabilities to return to work by accessing affordable health insurance.
    ~ Hold hearings on the current mental health parity legislation immediately and to review the
       strengths and weaknesses of the current law.
