          PRESIDENT LAUNCHES NEW CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE THAT
    LOW-INCOME MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE
                             July 6,1998

Today, the President announced a new outreach campaign to help millions oflow-income seniors
and people with disabilities get assistance in paying Medicare premiums. A study by Families
USA reports that over 3 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries are not enrolled in the
Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) and related programs that pay for Medicare premiums
and (for some) copayments and deductibles. This assistance was expanded last year in the
Balanced Budget Act. However, as this new report underscores, many eligible beneficiaries are
not aware of these cost-sharing protections and others have difficulty accessing this critically
needed assistance.

To address this problem, the President has requested that the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) launch a multi-faceted effort to
enroll eligible Medicare beneficiaries in QMB and related programs. These new initiatives,
which build on existing efforts to help identify and enroll eligible beneficiaries and parallel the
President's efforts on children's health outreach, include:

    Launching major new initiatives to educate Medicare beneficiaries about premium
     assistance programs. HHS and SSA will make unprecedented efforts to ensuring that
     beneficiaries know about these programs by distributing clear, plainly written information
     about these programs by:

        Sending written information to all 38 million Medicare beneficiaries about this
        program through pamphlets that will be sent to all beneficiaries this fall.

        Informing every one of the 1.8 million new Medicare beneficiaries about this program
        in the Medicare initial enrollment package that is sent to these beneficiaries.
        Including information describing this program and an eligibility screening
        worksheet on the new Medicare Internet site, "www.medicare.gov," which is used by
        millions of older Americans and their families, as well as others who work with the
        elderly and people with the disabilities.

        Sending program information to more than 36 million individuals receiving Social
        Security benefits in the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) notices this fall.

        Distributing 450,000 pamphlets as well as placing posters in SSA's 1,300 field offices
        where millions of beneficiaries go to enroll and ask questions about these programs.
        SSA will direct its field office employees to reach out to the millions of beneficiaries they
        see every day to ensure they are informed about QMB and related programs.



   Encouraging the use of a simplified application process. In July, the Health Care
    Financing Administration (HeF A) will send.llletter to State Medicaid agencies that includes
                              AutOmated Recoras MlUlagement System
                              Hex-Dump Conversion
       programs. HCFA will encourage states to adopt simple, user-friendly procedures such as a
       mail-in application.

      Creating a Federal-State-consumer advocate task force to develop new strategies to
       enroll eligible beneficiaries. Beginning this month, HHS, SSA, the National Governors'
       Association, and advocates of the elderly and people with disabilities will col1aborate to
       identify and implement strategies to educate beneficiaries about this program and to make it
       easier to emoll.

      Targeting eligible beneficiaries through direct mailings. This fal1, HCF A will send a
       letter to a targeted group of beneficiaries who are likely to be eligible for these protections.
       The targeting population list will come from a list of beneficiaries supplied by SSA that the
       agency believes may be eligible. The letter will explain the program and encourage
       beneficiaries to apply.

      Providing the State Insurance Counseling and Assistance Programs (I CAs) with
       materials to assist beneficiaries in enrolling in the premium assistance programs.
       ICAs provide assistance on insurance and benefits to millions of older and disabled
       Americans.

These new initiatives build on an ongoing commitment by HCFA and SSA to target and emol1
these vulnerable, low income Americans. For example, HCFA has provided training materials
on identifying and assisting potential beneficiaries to providers, advocates and States. SSA has
included information on programs in SSA pamphlets and handouts that could reach potential
candidates and conducted training for staff who interact with beneficiaries.
