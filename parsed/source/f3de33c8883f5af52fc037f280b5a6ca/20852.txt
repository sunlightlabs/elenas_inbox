FACT SHEET
Revised July 28, 1998

                  EXECUTIVE ORDER ISSUED MAY 28, 1998
           PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION IN THE FEDERAL CIVILIAN
               WORKFORCE BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION

Background:

      Executive Order 13087 was issued on May 28, 1998. It amends an earlier executive
       order, Executive Order 11478. It restates the pre-existing policy of the Executive Branch
       of the Federal Government to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in
       federal civilian employment.

      Representative Hefley of Colorado and others have indicated that they will attempt to
       amend an appropriations bill to prohibit the use of federal funds to implement, enforce or
       administer the Executive Order. The Administration opposes this effort.

What exactly does the Executive Order provide?

      The Executive Order will ensure that there is a uniform policy throughout the Federal
       Government's Executive Branch by adding sexual orientation to the list of categories
       (i.e. race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or age) for which discrimination
       is prohibited in hiring, firing and promotion in the civilian federal workforce, as
       provided for in Executive Order 11478.

      This policy is about basic fairness, not about "special rights."

Does this affect affirmative action policy or create special treatment for certain groups?

      No. Executive Order 13087 does not authorize affirmative action based on sexual
       orientation. It does not allow preferential treatment. It does not require that
       agencies find out which of their employees are gay, or how many gay employees they
       have hired. There are not quota programs in place for federal civilian hiring, and
       Executive Order 13087 does not create one.

Will this lead to collecting information regarding the sexual orientation of employees?

      No. Executive Order 13087 does not authorize collecting or reporting information
       about the sexual orientation of employees. Currently, federal agencies report
       information regarding the      race, disability, national origin and gender of
       employees, but not regarding other classifications included in Executive Order
       11478, such as religion. Similarly, information will not be collected or reported
       regarding sexual orientation.

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion



The CRS study states that whether there will be implementation of affirmative action is a
"matter of speculation." Is that true?

.     No, there is no need for speculation. White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, in a
       letter dated July 22, 1998, has clearly stated that "Executive Order 13087 does not
       authorize affirmative action policies, such as recruitment, reporting, or goal-setting
       based on sexual orientation."

Is this a new policy?

      No. It has always been the practice of this Administration to prohibit discrimination in
       employment based on sexual orientation in the civilian workforce, and most federal
       agencies and department have taken actions, such as the issuance of policy directives or
       memoranda from the agency heads, to memorialize that policy. The Executive Order
       states this policy unifonnly and for the first time in an Executive Order of the President.

      Moreover, federal law has for a long time provided that discrimination in federal civilian
       employment based upon sexual orientation is a prohibited personnel practice if it is found
       that sexual orientation did not adversely affect the perfonnance of the employee. [Title 5
       of the U.S. Code, section 2302(b)(10) prohibits "discriminat[ion] for or against any
       employee or applicant for employment on the basis of conduct which does not adversely
       affect the perfonnance of the employee or applicant or the perfonnance of others ... "]

      As far back as 1980, OPM has issued its interpretation of existing federal law stating that
       "applicants and employees are to be protected against inquiries into, or actions based
       upon, non-job-related conduct, such as religious, community, or social affiliations, or
       sexual orientation."

If this is not a new policy, why was an Executive Order necessary?

      The Executive Order states a unifonn policy throughout the Executive Branch of the
       Federal Government.

What impact does this have on the uniformed military service?

      None. This order does not apply to the unifonned military service.

What, if any, enforcement rights are granted?

      This Executive Order states Administration policy but does not create any new
       enforcement rights. Those rights would be granted by legislation passed by the Congress,
       such as the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, H.R. 1858, which the President
       supports. White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruffhas stated: "The executive order does


                                               2
                                                                      Hex-Dump ConversIon
       not create any rights to file a complaint alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual
       orientation with a court or with the EEOC. The order leaves intact the current
       procedures for dealing with such complaints. An employee who believes he or she has
       suffered adverse action may seek redress under procedures now available within each
       agency."
      Even the CRS study concludes that "E.O. 13087 essentially makes [the prohibition
       against discrimination based on sexual orientation] universal in the Federal Executive
       Branch and with respect to civilian employees of the military .departments ... , but would
       not create judicial enforceable rights in the absence of congressional action."

What is the authority for the President to issue this executive order?

      Presidents since George Washington have directed Executive Orders to their employees
       in the Executive Branch. In 1966, Congress specifically reinforced the President's
       Constitutional authority to "prescribe regulations for the conduct of employees in the
       executive branch." 5 U.S.C.  7301. Presidents have frequently exercised that authority
       over the federal workforce, issuing scores of Executive Orders. This particular Order by
       President Clinton amends Executive Order 11478, issued in 1969 by President Nixon,
       barring federal employees from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, national
       origin, handicap or age. The same authority that supported that Order supports this one.
       President Reagan issued Executive Order 12564, requiring a drug-free federal workplace,
       and Executive Order 12353, governing charitable fundraising by federal employees.
       President Bush issued Executive Order 12674, setting forth principles of ethical conduct
       for government employees. It would be contradictory to contend that the President can
       regulate the ethical conduct of federal employees, that he can prescribe standards for
       fundraising and require drug testing, but cannot instruct federal employees to refrain from
       discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation.

What is the meaning of the phrase "sexual orientation?"

      The President intends the term to have the common meaning stated in the
       Employment       Non-Discrimination        Act,   "homosexuality,     bisexuality, or
       heteros톏xuality." With regard to all these issues, as this is the President's order,
       the President's intent informs the meaning of the executive order. See Sea-Land
       Service, Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 738 F.2d 1311, 1314 (D.c. Cir.
       1984) ("The 'law' at issue in this instance is an Executive Order promulgated by the
       President, and it is to his intent that we must turn for guidance ... ").

Is this an attempt to legislate by executive order?

      This executive order does not amend Title VII or Executive Order 11246 or create new
       rights or remedies for discrimination based on sexual orientation.  It is the role of
       Congress, and not the Executive Branch, to amend federal statutes.

      Unlike Title VII, which applies to employers generally, including private employers,
       Executive Order 13087 merely sets internal employment policy for the Executive Branch.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


Would the executive order require federal contractors or state and local governments to
hire gays?

     This executive order applies only to employees of the Executive branch; it does not apply
      to federal contractors, subcontractors or grant recipients, or to State and local
      governments. Federal contractors are not "employees" of the Federal government.

Is there public support for the Executive Order?

     Recent national polls by Newsweek and the Associated Press indicate that between
      84-85% of Americans favor equal rights for gay people in the workplace.

     The proposed federal legislation on this topic, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,
      H.R. 1858 and S. 869, enjoys strong bipartisan support in the 105th Congress, with 33
      Senator cosponsors and 159 House cosponsors. In addition, a majority of House
      Members and over two-thirds of the Senate have specifically indicated that sexual
      orientation was not a consideration in their own employment practices.
