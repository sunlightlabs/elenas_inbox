 exempt social security, permit capital budgeting, and permit simple
 majority waivers for economic emergencies; (2) Kennedy amendment to exempt
 Social Security -- defeated 9-9 (Specter, R-PA, broke ranks and voted in
 favor); (3) Feinstein substitute amendment, similar to TorricelliO, s but
 also changing the debt ceiling provision to a simple majority; (4) Leahy
 amendment to drop the supermajority debt ceiling· provision; (5) Durbin
 amendment to add tax expenditures to the provision requiring a rollcall
 vote by a majority of Members to raise revenues; and (6) a Feingold
 amendment to shorten the ratification deadline from 7 to 3 years.
