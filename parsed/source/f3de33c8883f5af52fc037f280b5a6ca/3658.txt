                           The National Service Scholars Program

President Clinton announced today that more than 1,600 high school students have won
scholarships of at least $1,000 in the first year of the National Service Scholars Program. The
college scholarships recognize outstanding community service.

The President proposed the program last year in an address at Penn State University, challenging
communities to raise at least $500 for their local high schools, which the federal government
would then match. High school principals nominate the junior or senior with a strong
commitment to community service to receive scholarships.

The $500 federal match is provided by the Corporation for National Service, which launched the
program this spring in partnership with the Citizens' Scholarship Foundation of America. The
deadline to apply for the program was June 30, and 1,683 high schools submitted nominees.
Awards will be sent to scholarship winners in early August.

The program has proved extremely popular, with a host of leading community organizations
stepping forward to raise local scholarships and secure the federal match. The most frequent
local
contributors include: Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions, Dollars for Scholars, Seventh Day Adventists,
Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, Elks, Women's Clubs, the Masons,
Soroptomists, Junior Leagues, Optimists, Jaycees, Quota International, Sertoma, Parent Teacher
Associations, and Chambers of Commerce. The Miss America Foundation committed to
providing matching scholarships in every state; Sallie Mae provided the matching funds for every
public high school in the District of Columbia; and the Minnesota state legislature voted to fund
the match for all high schools in that state.

When he announced the initiative at Penn State, President Clinton said, "I want every principal in
America to be able to stand up before a graduating class and announce the name of a National
Service Scholar. We should make service to the community a part of every high school in
America and a part oflife of every dedicated citizen in the United States." Noting the success of
the first year effort, the President today challenged schools and communities to award
scholarships to many more students next year, with the goal of instituting the program in all high
schools.

The President's FY 1998 budget includes $10 million for the National Service Scholars Program,
enough to take the program nation-wide.

Attending the radio address where the President made the announcement were two scholarship
winners and representatives from four civic groups that raised local scholarship funds (add
names).
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


                        Talking Points on Presidents' Summit Followup

The President's Commitment: The President remains committed to the goals of the
Presidents' Summit for America's Future in April in Philadelphia. The Summit's goals for
children (a caring adult, a safe place, a healthy start, a marketable skill, and a chance to serve) are
each vital goals of the Administration.

Since April, the President has continued to speak about the importance of service and
volunteerism to audiences, including the Business Roundtable, the Conference of Mayors, and
businesses attending the announcement of the Welfare-to-Work Partnership. He has talked
extensively about how all of us must move forward to reach the goals of the Summit and to give
more children what they need to grow up to be productive citizens.

In addition, the President applauds the work of General Powell and America's Promise and looks
forward to possible participation in future Summit activities. In fact, Members of the
President's Cabinet will soon begin to participate in follow-up Summits around the country.

National Service Scholars: On Saturday the President announced in his weekly radio
address that over 1,600 high school students have won scholarships of at least $1,000 as
part of the fIrst year of the National Service Scholars program. These scholarships
recognize students with outstanding records of community service. The President fIrst
called for this program in a speech at Penn State in May 1996, challenging communities to
raise at least $500 for their local high schools, which the federal government would then
match. In the fIrst year, a host of leading community organizations stepped forward to
raise local scholarships, including the Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions, Dollars for Scholars,
Seventh Day Adventists, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, Elks, Women's
Clubs, Masons, Soroptomists, and Junior Leagues. The Miss America Foundation
committed to provide scholarships in every state. Sallie Mae provided the matching funds
for every public high school in D.C. The Minnesota state legislature voted to fund the
match for all high schools in that state. Each high school principal is invited to nominate a
junior or senior for the scholarship. He urged all 20,000 high schools in the nation to
participate next year.

Representatives of civic groups along with fIve scholarship winners were in the audience.
Our hope is that civic organizations will publicize this event in their newsletters and drum
up even more support for this program next year.

AmeriCorps Scholarships: Saturday the President announced that service and religious
organizations have responded positively to his summit challenge that the Administration
would provide 50,000 new AmeriCorps scholarships over the next 5 years to organizations
that offer young people the chance to serve. The response has been even stronger than
expected, as 77 organizations have answered that challenge by offering to sponsor 10,000
new AmeriCorps members. The Corporation expects to make the first year's awards this
summer.

Recent Actions on Welfare and Children's Health:
     In May, the Vice President announced that he will head a new partnership of civic
      organizations that will mentor families seeking to leave welfare for work.

     Eli Segal's Welfare to Work Partnership is mobilizing businesses to hire welfare
      recipients, so that those parents can move into the economic mainstream and
      improve their children's future. A major expansion of this group was announced
      in May.

     In June, the President announced that Kaiser Permanente will commit $100 million
      to provide health coverage for uninsured children in California, complementing the
      Administration's efforts to enact new legislation on children's health coverage.

Federal Agency Commitments: Federal agencies are following through on the more than
40 commitments they made at the summit, which included mentoring and tutoring and
launching new partnerships with corporations and nonprofits. They are also continuing
to launch new initiatives and partnerships to reach the summit's goals. The following
highlights some of our progress since the Summit.

     The White House has convened an interagency group to focus on this issue_ It will meet
      regularly and hold agencies accountable for their progress. The White House has asked
      all agencies to complete timelines and milestones that show how they intend to reach
      their commitments.

     The Administration is working with the National Association of Partners in Education to
      meet its goal of adopting or establishing partnerships with an additional 500 schools by
      the year 2000. Prior to the summit, federal agencies had partnerships with approximately
      1,500 schools across the country. The Social Security Administration and the
      Department of Transportation have already established new partnerships since the
      summit, while the Department of Health and Human Services is working with the
      organization "Everybody Wins" to adopt more schools. In addition, this summer the
      Labor Department is operating a new four-week summer academic enrichment program
      for D.C. public school students in partnership with the National Council of Negro
      Women.

     The Administration is working toward its goal of using national service as a strategy in
      the President's proposed America Reads program, the national literacy campaign to
      ensure that every child can read well and independently by the third grade. At this
      time, the Senate has appropriated $20 million for the Corporation for National Service to
      fund AmeriCorps tutor coordinators to help recruit, organize, and manage
      volunteers who will tutor children. While awaiting congressional action, the
      Corporation is launching a "Seniors in Schools" initiative, with nine pilot sites and
      support for 8,700 school-based Senior Corps programs. In September, the Corporation
      will deploy the DC Reads Initiative, with AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and federal
.'                                                                            Hex텱ump Conversion

         work-study students tutoring in 18 of the lowest performing public elementary schools in
         D.C. In addition, the Corporation and the Department of Education have recruited over
         500 colleges and universities to dedicate work study students as reading tutors. This
         summer, AmeriCorps members are helping 8,000 pre-K to 3rd grade students with
         reading as part of20 "Summer Reads" programs.

        The Corporation for National Service is taking the lead on a strategy to meet the
         Summit's goal of engaging an additional 2 million young people in service. In August, it
         will convene a national strategic planning session in Washington in partnership with
         America's Promise and Do Something, with participation from the youth community,
         faith groups, the education community, and summit commitment makers in this area.
         The Corporation hopes that America's Promise will assist its efforts to expand the
         National Service Scholars program next year; its goal is to reach every high school in
         America. The Corporation will place an AmeriCorps*VISTA member in every public
         high school in D.C. to serve as the service-learning coordinator. Finally, the Partnering
         Initiative co-sponsored by the Corporation is working this summer to launch "partner
         schools" in the fall -- schools with model service-learning programs.

        The Corporation and its State Commissions on National and Community Service are
         taking lead roles in organizing many of the community and state summits in the months
         following the summit gathering in Philadelphia.

        In June, HHS Secretary Shalala launched a new partnership between the Girl Scouts of
         the U.S.A. and the Department's Girl Power! public education campaign. This national
         program will teach Girl Scouts about the dangers of substance abuse and other risky
         behaviors. It features a new patch that Girl Scouts can earn by completing the program.
         HHS has also launched its Playcorps commitment with Nike, which trains college
         students to coach and mentor kids in underserved areas in recreation leagues.

        In September, USDA Secretary Dan Glickman will convene his department's National
         Summit on Food Recovery, to develop a national strategy to increase gleaning efforts by
         one-third by the year 2000.

        This month, the Department of Justice followed through on its commitment to expand its
         Drug Education for Youth (DEFY) program. DOJ gave out grants to 26 DEFY summer
         camp sites that are now serving 900 children. DEFY promotes positive life choices for
         children between the ages of9 and 12. After the summer program, the children will have
         mentors from the local U.S. Attorney's office, police department, or university.

        In May, the Department of Justice and the Corporation for National Service held the first
         meeting of a new public/private Mentoring Alliance that will promote the mentoring goal
         of the Summit. Menibers include Big Brothers/Big Sisters, One to One, Boys and Girls
         Clubs of America, Save the Children, and federal agencies. Plans include a
         teleconference in September on effective practices, a national 800 number to link mentors
         with opportunities, and development of best practices materials. In addition, DOJ
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
    expects to follow through shortly on its commitment to more than double the number of
    sites for its Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP).

   In June, the Attorney General kicked off the Department of Justice's new Youth Network
    in Baltimore, to provide a forum for young people and community organizations to
    exchange ideas on juvenile violence and delinquency prevention.

   The Department of Education now has 380,000 tutors and learning partners reading with
    children this summer, a significant increase over last summer's 300,000 and is well on its
    way to its goal of 450,000. The program's goal is to get 1.5 million children reading by
    the end of the summer. In addition, the Department has added 300 partners to its
    Partnership for Family Involvement in Education, for a total of 3,000 partner
    organizations.

   In May, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater launched his department's new effort, the
    Garrett A. Morgan Technology & Transportation Futures Program, in Cleveland, Ohio, at
    the Garrett A. Morgan Middle School. With its industry and labor partners, the
    Department updated the school's computer lab, established a tutoring and mentoring
    program, and sponsored transportation career days for the students. To date, DOT has
    heard from over 200 partners who want to join its effort to reach one million students by
    the year 2000. The program's goal is to give one million students better math, science,
    and technology skills and information about careers in technology and transportation,
    through tutoring, mentoring, and educational curricula.
