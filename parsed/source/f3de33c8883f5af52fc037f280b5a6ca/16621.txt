Dialogue

3.    Debate should move from English only to English plus
4.    Difference between prejudice which is a belief and racism which is acting on prejudice
5.    America needs to' agree on common values I aspirations


                                                                                                 1

6.     We need to educate Americans on the facts e.g. why are there haves and have nots?
       What are impediments to equal opportunity?
7.     Recognize that not everyone will be starting in the same place
8.     Should group membership include people from different races in proportion to

       b.      We don't have a person to waste
       c.      Reality: whites aren't majority in the future
       d.      Cost of discrimination (need to measure)
2.     Use the bully pulpit (President, Cabinet)
3.     Bring together CEOs from majority and minority communities
4.     Get kids to talk to each other
5.     Sponsor a Race for the Races - footrace before town meetings

       c.      Encourage commercials rather than lengthy specials
       d.      Need to educate media, too
9.     Sponsor unity concerts

Audience
1.    White soccer moms
2.    Internet users
      a.      Email (85% has been very positive)
      b.      Capture best practices on website
      c.      Sponsor interactive dialogues
3.    Folks who aren't invested
4.    People who don't believe that racism exists
      a.      Mystery shopper testing is a good way to demonstrate existence of racism


                                                                                              2
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
5.     Whites and other races - need to measure changes in attitudes
6.     Policy makers
7.     Corporate America -- believes in traditional meritocracy, need to broaden vision of what
       merit is
8.     Federal Government must model behavior
       a.      E.g. military believes every person can achieve with adequate support! training
       b.      How to respond to the culture of entitlement, especially for non-performers

Concluding remarks
1.    Year long initiative needs to lay foundation for continued progress
2.    Need to narrow focus of initiative to concrete goals




                                                                                                    3
