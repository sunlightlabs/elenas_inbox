TEXT:
Attached is the outline we discussed on the welfare to work options for
the Federal government.  I dropped the suggestion of expanding the
existing Federal program because I think you're right -- a new program
targeted specifically to welfare recipients offers a bigger bang.

I'm still looking into the question of whether or not Federal agencies
could keep the savings realized from moving welfare recipients off the
rolls.     ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

     Re:            Welfare-to-Work Options for the Federal Government


     Following are four steps the Federal government can take to hire and train welfare recipients.

     I.      Create a New Hiring Avenue for Welfare Recipients

     Through Executive Order, the President can create excepted service hiring authority for welfare
     recipients. The program would:

            Create an indefinite appointment with conversion eligibility to the competitive service;

            Encourage conversion to career status after two years of satisfactory performance

            Require job-specific training and/or education after initial hire

            Enact a peer counselor or mentor program for those hired under this status

            Offer performance-based tuition assistance

     II.     Make Work Pay for Those Welfare Recipients Who Choose Employment in the
             Federal Government

            Encourage agencies to establish more agency-based child care centers and set sliding-fee
             rate scales based on income.

            Publicize the existing Federal Fare Subsidy Program which allows Federal agencies to
             subsidize the cost of public transportation in areas where state and local programs exist.

            Allow welfare recipients hired through the excepted service hiring authority to participate
             in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program after their transitional
             Medicaid expires.

     III.    Use the Information Super Highway to Publicize Federal Job Opportunities and
             Offer Career Counseling

            Deliver career counseling through USACareers, a new, interactive computer-based
             internet web site currently under development by OPM's Employment Service. The site
             should be up by March 1997 and will analyze skills and abilities and develop training
             plans for welfare recipients to get the skills and aptitudes necessary for Federal
             emp1.oyment.
                                                                          Hex텱wnp Conversion

             Initiate a publicity campaign through the Federal Employment Information Highway to
              inform both welfare recipients and state, local, and nonprofit social service agencies of
              available jobs and avenues to those jobs including training for welfare caseworkers and
              recipients on USAJOBS, OPM's employment information Homepage.

             Implement Hiring Outlook, an electronic information system designed to provide
              information on Federal occupations including appointment types, permanent and
              temporary employment opportunities, and needed skills.

             Continue and expand posting of state, local, and municipal government jobs and solicit
              support and help from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the League of Cities, the National
              Association of Counties, and the National Governors Association.

      IV.     Offer Federal Agencies Incentives For Hiring Welfare Recipients

             Encourage Federal agencies to set hiring goals.

             Encourage Federal agencies to work with relevant states and localities to temporarily
              subsidize the wages of welfare recipients with their cash and food stamp benefits.

             Offer Presidential recognition to Federal agencies that make the greatest strives to hire
              people off welfare.

             Require Cabinet Secretaries to report hiring progress monthly to the White House.
