           1998 Education Budget: An Historic Investment in Educational Opponunity
                                                November 13, 1997

 Now I ask you -- and I ask all our nation's governors; I ask parents, teachers, and citizens all across America --
lfor a new nonpartisan commitment to education -- because education is a critical national security issue for our
lfuture, and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door.
                                    President Clinton, State of the Union Address, February 4,1997

The President's signature on the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill today, along with the education
tax cuts enacted in August, take us an historic step closer to reaching the President's goal of making sure
that every 8-year old can read, every I2-year old can log on to Internet, every I8-year old can go to
college, and all Americans can keep on learning throughout their lifetimes, This represents the largest
increase in our education investment in a generation, including the biggest increase in college aid since the GI
Bill 50 years ago. The bill signed today:

CONTINUES DEVELOPMENT OF VOLUNTARY NATIONAL TESTS. The bill provides full funding to
proceed with immediate development of the first-ever voluntary national tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade
math, based on widely accepted national standards used in the National Assessment of Educational Progress
(NAEP). It puts the independent, bipartisan National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) in charge of test
policies and development, as the Administration had proposed. The bill provides the Administration's full
request of $16 million to support the testing plan, and allows for pilot testing to begin in Fall 1998. The
legislation also provides for a feasibility study to determine if existing state tests can be linked to both the NAEP
standards and each other.

PROVIDES FUNDING FOR THE AMERICA READS CHALLENGE.                        The bill provides nearly $300 million in
new funding towards the President's comprehensive strategy for involving teachers, families and communities in
ensuring that all children learn to read well and independently by the end of third grade. These resources will be
used to build on current AmeriCorps and college work-study tutoring efforts (more than 800 colleges have
already committed to use Federal work-study slots for reading tutors).

BRINGS TECHNOLOGY TO THE CLASSROOM. Funding for the President's two education technology
programs, started from scratch three years ago, is more than doubled, to $531 million. The Technology
Literacy Challenge Fund helps States, communities, and schools acquire hardware, software, and connedivity
linkages; provide professional development in the integration of technology into the curriculum; and apply
technology to support school reform efforts and opportunities for all students. The Technology Innovation
Challenge Grants support a wide range of innovative strategies for improving teaching and learning and
increasing student access to technology.

EXPANDS CHOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. President Clinton's Public Charter
Schools Program received a 57 percent increase, from $51 milliqn to $80 million. By the end of next year, the
Department of Education will be funding nearly 1,000 locally-designed charter schools, accelerating progress
toward the President's goal of developing 3,000 new charter schools by early in the next century -- a goal
adopted by bipartisan charter school legislation passed by the House last week.

EXPANDS HEAD START TOWARD 1 MILLION CHILDREN The bill provides nearly $4.4 billion for Head
Start, keeping on track to meet the President's goal of serving one million children. With this $374 million
increase, Head Start funding will have increased 57 since 1993. The program will serve an estimated 836,000
children in 1998.

INCREASES PELL GRANT AWARD TO $3,000 MAXIMUM, Congress adopted President Clinton's proposal
                                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
to increase the maximum Pell Grant to $3,000 -- the largest increase in two decades.   Approximately 3.7 million
students will receive this year's $300 increase, and an additional 220,000 low- and moderate-income families that
were not previously eligible will receive Pell Grants.
                                                                                   Hex·Dump Conversion
                                  1998 Education Budget:
                     An Historic Investment in Educational Opportunity
                                         November 13, 1997

Now I ask you -- and I ask all our nation's governors; I ask parents, teachers, and citizens all
across America -- for a new nonpartisan commitment to education -- because education is a critical
national security issue for our future, and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door.

HIGHLIGHTS: The President's signature on the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill today,
along with the education tax cuts enacted in August, take us an historic step closer to reaching the
President's goal of making sure that every 8-year old can read, every 12-year old can log on to
Internet, every I8-year old can go to college, and all Americans can keep on learning throughout
their lifetimes. This represents the largest increase in our education investment in a generation,
including the biggest increase in college aid since the GI Bill 50 years ago. The bill signed today:
         promotes high standards and continued development of voluntary national tests;
         increases Pell Grants to $3,000 -- the largest increase in two decades;
         expands Head Start;
         funds America Reads to help all children read well and independently by age 8;
         brings technology to the classroom; and
         expands choice and accountability through public charter schools.


RAISING STANDARDS: HELPING STUDENTS MASTER THE BASICS AND ADVANCED
SKILLS

Continues Development of Voluntary National Tests. The bill provides full funding to proceed
with immediate development of the first-ever voluntary national tests in 4th grade reading and
8th grade math, based on widely accepted national standards used in the National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP). It puts the independent, bipartisan National Assessment
Governing Board (NAGB) in charge of test policies and development, as the Administration
had proposed. The bill provides the Administration's full request of $16 million to support the
testing plan, and allows for pilot testing to begin in Fall 1998. The bill also provides for a
feasibility study to determine if existing state tests can be linked to both the NAEP standards and
each other.

Provides Funding for the America Reads Challenge. The bill provides nearly $300 million in new
funding towards the President's comprehensive strategy for involving teachers, families and
communities in ensuring that all children learn to read well and independently by the end of third
grade. These resources will be used to build on current AmeriCorps and college work-study
tutoring efforts (more than 800 colleges have already committed to use Federal work-study slots
for reading tutors).

                AmeriCorps and the senior volunteer programs won an increase of $64 million in
                the two bills that fund the National Service program ($39 million in the bill
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
                signed today). This will fund 3000 new AmeriCorps members and thousands of
                new senior volunteers who will recruit more than 100,000 volunteer tutors.

                State teacher training and family literacy efforts are increased a total of $41 million,
                and $5 million is provided to help provide training for tutors.

                Provides an advance appropriation of $210 million for pending legislation based
                on the President's America Reads initiative. The House version of that
                legislation -- promoting tutoring, family literacy, and teacher training -- passed the
                House with the Administration's support on November 8.

Brings Technology to the Classroom.         Funding for the President's two education technology programs,
started from scratch three years ago, is more than doubled, to $531 million:

                Technology Literacy Challenge Fund    The bill provides $425 million, more than
                twice as much as the $200 million appropriated last year, to help States,
                communities, and schools acquire hardware, software, and connectivity linkages;
                provide professional development in the integration of technology into the
                curriculum; and apply technology to support school reform efforts and
                opportunities for all students.

                Technology Innovation Challenge Grants.      The bill includes $106 million--an 86
                percent increase over last year's level of $57 million--to support up to 30 new
                projects, including 15 focused specifically on delivering the most effective training
