                                   JUNE 11, 1997                               Hex-Dump Conversion


Q:   What is the directive that the President signed today?

A:   Today, the President signed a directive to ensure that the Treasury
     Deportment do everything possible to enforce the Youth Handgun Safety
     Act -- including requiring that federal gun dealers post signs and issue
     written warnings that:

            (1) Make clear that it is generally illegal for any adult to transfer a
            handgun to a minor (under 18), or for that minor to possess that
            handgun, period;

            (2) Make clear that transferring a handgun to a minor may be
            punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment;

            (3) Warn that handguns are a leading contributor to juvenile
            violence and fatalities; and

           (4) Suggest that safely storing and locking handguns can help
           ensure compliance with this law.

Q:   What is the impact of this directive?    How is it any different -- or how does
     it augment -- current law?

A:   This directive will require, for the first time ever, that federal firearms
     dealers (FFLs) post signs and issue written warnings about the responsibility
     that gun purchasers have under current law to not transfer a handgun to
     juveniles -- as well as about the dangers that handguns pose to kids
     generally. That's an important change for two reasons.

     First, for almost every gun that gets into a juvenile's hands, an adult had
     the opportunity -- in fact, the legal responsibility -- to stop that transfer from
     taking place. Today's directive puts adult gun purchasers on notice
     about this responsibility -- and warns them about the legal sanctions that
     may apply if this responsibility is ignored.

     Second, the mix of kids and guns is at the heart of the nation's youth
     violence epidemic. Since the mid 1980s, the number of kids killing with a
     gun has quadrupled; the number of kids killed by guns has nearly tripled;
     and teenage boys today are more likely to die of gunshot wounds than all
     natural causes combined. Still, we do more to warn Americans about
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

     the dangers of most household products than we do about the dangers
     that guns pose to our children. Today's directive represents an effort to
     correct this imbalance.

Q:   Can you please clarify under what authority you're taking this action?

A:   The authority for this directive is fwo-fold:

           (1) 18 U.S.C. Sec. 926(a) generally provides that the Secretary of the
           Treasury may proscribe certain rules and regulations to carry out the
           provisions of the 1968 Gun Control Act as amended; and

            (2) 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(x)( 1) -- or the Youth Handgun Safety Act,
           which was included by Senator Kohl as an amendment to the 1994
           crime bill -- prohibits, in most circumstances, juveniles from
           possessing handguns, and adults from transferring handguns to
           juveniles.

     Our directive finds that additional warnings are necessary to fully carry out
     the prohibitions of the Youth Handgun Safety Act, and calls for signs to be
     posted and written warnings issued to help ensure compliance with the
     law.

Q:   What punishments are provided for in the Youth Handgun Safety Act?

A:   Juveniles who violate the ban on handgun possession are subject to
     mandatory probation. Adults who violate the prohibition on transferring
     handguns to juveniles are punishable by a prison term of 1 to 10 years,
     depending on the circumstances. Additionally, the Administration has
     called for increasing both of these penalties in its juvenile crime legislation.

Q:   Have you successfully prosecuted anyone under the Youth Handgun
     Safety Act? Do you know how many persons have been prosecuted
     overall?

A:   No, I don't have a number on the total prosecutions. But I do have an
     example. I know that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tennessee successfully
     prosecuted an illegal gun dealer who -- among other illegal firearms
     activities -- sold a pistol to a 13-year old. He's been sentenced to 33
     months in prison.

Q:   Do you think that this directive will really help keep handguns from
     juveniles? Shouldn't your directive do more than simply call for signs and
     warnings?
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

      A:   Of course, we believe that this directive is meaningful and will have
           impact. And it certainly makes as much sense to warn gun purchasers
           about their legal responsibilities and the dangers of handguns as it does
           for the many other products that are sold with similar warnings.

           At the same time, there is only so much we can under existing law to keep
           guns out of the hands of juveniles. That's why our juvenile crime bill
           includes 3 key gun provisions: it increases penalties for transferring guns to
           juveniles; it prohibits violent juveniles from ever owning guns; and it
           requires that federal gun dealers provide child safety locks with every gun
           sold. With these additional changes in law, we will be able to do even
           more to keep guns away from our kids.

      Q:   If you're going to issue warnings about guns, why don't you just regulate
           them like other products through the Consumer Products Safety
           Commission?

      A:   First of all, today's directive does more than simply warn gun purchasers
           about the dangers of handguns; It makes clear to gun purchasers that
           they have responsibilities -- and that transferring a handgun to a juvenile is
           a crime punishable by as much as 10 years imprisonment.

           Second, the Consumer Products Safety Commission does not include
           firearms. It is expressly prohibited from getting into matters concerning
           the manufacture and sale of firearms and firearms ammunition. So we
           simply don't have this authority.

      Q.   What is the Administration's position on the various Republican proposals
           to combat juvenile crime?

      A.   First of all, we are opposed to H.R. 3, the bill that passed the House. It
           does not come close to representing a comprehensive attack gangs and
           guns. It doesn't guarantee that Boston's successful juvenile crime
           initiative -- Operations Cease-fire and Nite Lite -- can be replicated. It
           doesn't include any provisions relating to kids and guns. And it does not
           specifically address the high number of crime committed by juveniles
           when school goes out.

           We're hopeful that the Senate will work with us to address these issues.
           The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider legislation this
           Thursday, and we are communicating our concerns to them now. We
           will have to wait and see how the mark-up in that committee goes before
           we know whether or not we'll be able to support a Senate bill.
                                                  Hex·Dump Conversion

Q.   What does the Administration's juvenile justice proposal do?

A.   The legislation proposed by the President in February is part of an overall
     Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy that seeks to crack down on
     violent gangs, reduce youth violence, and provide our kids with positive
     alternatives to steer them away from gangs, guns, and drugs.

     The strategy provides critical resources for state and local prosecutors to
     target, prosecute and convict violent youth gangs. It permits Federal
     prosecutors to prosecute juveniles in adult court when they commit violent
     crimes. It requires child safety locks for guns to prevent accidents and
     thefts, and extends the Brady Law so that violent juveniles can never own
     a gun. Finally, the Strategy also calls for at least 1,000 after school
     initiatives to keep kids off the streets and give them positive alternatives.

     Juvenile crime legislation passed by Congress must address these key
     issues, too.
