                          Statement by the President on Tobacco
                                      April 28, 1999                  Automated Records Management System

This new report from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids underscores why I strongly oppose
any legislation waiving the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds without a
commitment from the states to fund youth tobacco prevention efforts. Without such a
commitment, states won't have to spend a single penny of the $246 billion to reduce youth
smoking. We must act now: Every day, 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1000 will
have their lives cut short as result.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

                                       Tobacco Q&A
                                  April 28, 1998 -- DRAFT


Q:   What do you think about the new report from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids
     showing states are not spending tobacco settlement funds to reduce youth smoking?

A:   This new report underscores why the President strongly opposes any legislation waiving
     the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds without a commitment from
     the states to fund youth tobacco prevention efforts. Without such a commitment, states
     won't have to spend a single penny of the $246 billion to reduce youth smoking. Every
     day, 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1000 will have their lives cut short as
     result.

     The report done by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, to be released on Thursday, is
     compelling:

           There are 25 states in which there is no proposal being seriously considered to
            guarantee the use of a substantial portion ofthe settlement funds for programs to
            reduce tobacco use among children.

           In recent months, only 4 states have decided to use settlement funds to reduce
            youth smoking, and unless Congress and the states act, only 9 states will have
            comprehensive efforts to reduce youth smoking.

     An average of 57 percent of the state recoveries is reimbursement for costs borne to the
     federal government, and the President believes that there should be a commitment by the
     states to use a portion of the monies from the settlement to prevent youth smoking,
     protect farmers, improve public health, and assist children. The Administration will
     work with the states and Congress to enact tobacco legislation that resolves the federal
     claim to tobacco settlement funds in exchange for a commitment by the States to use the
     federal share to support these shared state and national priorities.

Q:   Would the President veto the Supplemental Appropriations bill if it allows states to
     keep the entire $246 billion tobacco settlement?

A:   The President's senior advisors have recommended that he veto the Senate Supplemental
     bill, ifit is sent to him with the current objectionable riders like this tobacco provision.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

Q:   What do you think about the information in the Washington Post that states are not
     spending tobacco settlement funds to reduce youth smoking?

A:   This new information underscores why the President strongly opposes any legislation
     waiving the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds without a
     commitment from the states to fund youth tobacco prevention efforts. Without such a
     commitment, states won't have to spend a single penny of the $246 billion to reduce
     youth smoking. Every day, 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1000 will have
     their lives cut short as result.

     The information, based on a report by the by the Campaign for Tobacc'o Free Kids and the
     American Heart Association to be released on Thursday, is compelling:

           There are 25 states in which there is no proposal being seriously considered to
            guarantee the use of a substantial portion of the settlement funds for programs to
            reduce tobacco use among children.
