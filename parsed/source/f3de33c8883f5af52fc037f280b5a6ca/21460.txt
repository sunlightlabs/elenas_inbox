    BENEFICIARIES DROPPED BY THEIR HMOS AND TAKES STEPS TO PREVENT IT
                         FROM HAPPENING AGAIN
                               October 8, 1998

Today, the President unveiled a three-part initiative to respond to decisions by some Health
Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) to drop out of the program. The Department of Health and
Human Services' preliminary analysis indicates that because of these withdrawals a relatively small
number of Medicare beneficiaries currently in HMOs (one percent of the 5 million benficiaries in
managed care plans -- 50,000 enrollees) will have no managed care alternative in their area. However,
the President stated his concern for any beneficiary who has lost their HMO option because of the
decisions by some of these plans. Addressing the action taken by selected HMOs, the President:

      Criticized health plans for abandoning their commitment to Medicare beneficiaries but
       reiterated that the Administration would not grant the industry's request to raise
       premiums and reduce benefits for all Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs. The President
       underscored that Medicare should not -- and will not -- be held hostage to threats by HMOs to
       leave the program unless they can increase cost-sharing and reduce benefits to Medicare
       beneficiaries.
      Initiated a new Medicare campaign to help beneficiaries understand their rights and
       options. To reassure Medicare beneficiaries affected by HMO withdrawals, that they are
       automatically eligible for traditional fee-for-service Medicare and that the law guarantees them
       access to a number of Medigap policies which help fill Medicare's coverage gaps, HHS will:
               Enlist a wide range of public and private partners that represent tens of millions of older
               Americans to provide their members with the information they need through
               newsletters, conferences, training partners, and conducting targeted information
               campaigns. These partners include AFL-CIO, American Association of Health Plans,
               American Association of Retired Persons, the Leadership Council of Aging
               Organizations, National Council of Senior Citizens, and National Rural Health
               Association, as well as the Social Security Administration, HCF A Regional Offices, and
               State Health Insurance Assistance Programs;
               Post new information about plan withdrawals on the Medicare Internet cite that provides
               commonly asked questions and answers for Medicare beneficiaries, their families, and
               insurance counselors;
               Update Medicare.gov to ensure accurate information is available for each local area on
               any changes in plan options, resulting from these HMO withdrawals;
               Distribute a model letter to all health plans that have chosen to drop out of the program
               to help notify beneficiaries of their options.

      Announced a new policy to encourage health plans to enter markets that have been
       abandoned and to expedite their approval. HCF A will expedite its review and approval of
       HMOs seeking to enter markets that have been left without a managed care option. Any such
       applications will receive first priority for review and HCF A will seek to expedite their entrance
       into the market as long as they meet necessary solvency, quality, and other standards that
       protect beneficiaries. The President emphasized that plans that withdraw from these would not
       be eligible for this option this year.

                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
    are protected from these types of withdrawals in the future. The President emphasized his
    detennination that the Administration and the Congress should work together to take all
    possible actions to help assure an adequate range of health plan options for beneficiaries and
    reduce the likelihood that beneficiaries will face this kind oftunnoil in the future. To that end,
    he asked the Secretary to recommend specific legislative proposals to be included in the
    President's next budget that are designed to enhance plan participation and beneficiary
    protections.

   Highlighted the need for Congress to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. One of the
    most important ways that older Americans get critical infonnation they need during times of
    tunnoillike this one is through essential programs provided by the Older Americans Act.
    Today, the President sent a letter to Senator Lott and Speaker Gingrich urging them to
    reauthorize the Older Americans Act before Congress adjourns. He emphasized that failure
    to do so would call into question our nation's commitment to the OAA and the vital
    services it provides to millions of older Americans.
