 TEXT:
 This draft builds on CEA's initial piece, reflects our discussion from
 last week, and includes comments from CEA and Treasury.  CEA may have some
 more comments tomorrow morning, but I wanted to share what we had at this
 point.

 One obvious weakness is that there are many questions we can't answer: how
 much R&D remains to be done, for example.

 Let me know if this is helpful, or if you want it fleshed out more ...

 Thanks,

    The Tobacco Settlement and Incentives to Develop Reduced-Risk Tobacco Products
                                     July 28, 1997

I. Background

        In the past, the tobacco industry has not developed many innovative, safer products -- in
large measure because to develop and promote safer products would have been to acknowledge
the harm done by existing products. But some innovations, like filters and reduced-tar
cigarettes, do appear to have followed the release of adverse health news about smoking. In the
current environment, in which are companies admitting that their products are harmful and
consumer awareness of smoking's risks is heightened, individual companies may be more likely
to view the development of safer products as a profitable endeavor.

       The Settlement includes provisions intended to speed the introduction of safer products.
According to the Settlement, the goal of these provisions "is to guarantee that a mechanism exists
to ensure that products which appear to hold out the hope of reducing risk are actually tested and
made available in the marketplace and not held back." The types of innovations expected to be
introduced include the removal oftoxic constituents from cigarettes, a reduction in the nicotine
content in cigarettes, and alternative delivery devices for nicotine that remain attractive to
consumers.

II. Provisions ofthe Settlement

       Provisions relating to reduced risk products are in Title I, Section E, Part 4 ofthe
Settlement. Manufacturers will be required to:

      Notify FDA of any technology that they develop or acquire and that reduces the risk from
       tobacco products, and

      For a "commercially reasonable" fee, cross license all such technology to those
       companies also covered by the same obligations. Procedural protections will be built in
       to resolve license fee disputes.

       Other provisions include:

      If the technology is in early development stages, manufacturers will be provided
       confidentiality during the development process.

      The FDA will have the authority to mandate the introduction ofless hazardous products
       that are technologically feasible by requiring the manufacturer who owns the technology
       to introduce the product or to license the technology to another producer. If no
       manufacturer or licensee brings such products to market in a reasonable time frame set by
       FDA, the U.S. Public Health Service may produce the product, either itself or through a

         licensing arrangement.

III. The economic tradeoff between dissemination and incentives for R&D

         One concern with these provisions is that they effectively eliminate the patent system for
tobacco products. Economists have long struggled with the optimal design of a patent system.
Ifnew innovation occurred spontaneously -- without the need to invest in R&D -- society's
interest would be best served by requiring immediate, full disclosure and licensing of new
products and technologies without fee. But innovation generally does require investment -- and
full disclosure coupled with free adoption by other firms provides little or no incentive for such
investment to be undertaken. The patent system therefore grants a property right to the inventor
"to exclude others from making, using or selling the invention." The fundamental tradeoff in
the patent system -- inherent in designing the length and comprehensiveness of the patent
protection -- is to balance the need to encourage R&D with the desire to disseminate new
discoveries as quickly as possible.

IV. The Settlement and incentives

        The Settlement's provisions, especially the cross-licensing requirement, are at one
extreme of possible patent systems. They ensure rapid dissemination of new discoveries, but
provide little incentive for firms to invest further in the processes that could lead to such
discoveries. A crucial question to answer is how much of the total possible R&D has been
undertaken, and how much remains to be done. In the area of removing toxins from
cigarettes, much - though not aU ~ is apparently already technologicaUy feasible. Some
analysts believe that current knowledge would also aUow a reduction of the nicotine
content in commerciaUy viable cigarettes within a relatively short period (e.g., 6 months);
others believe that such products are a decade away. A critical question for FDA and
others to answer is how much research remains to be undertaken, and in what specific areas.

        To the extent that most of the relevant R&D has already been undertaken, the incentive
problems are not significant. Eriforcing full and even free cross-licensing of extant R&D may
not pose the same incentive problems as enforcing cross-licensing offuture R&D. Two
potential dangers with cross-licensing existing R&D are (1) it may damage the government's
credibility that such a requirement will not be repeated in the future, thus reducing incentives for
future R&D; and (2) it may be difficult to derme an "existing" innovation (how would a
prototype be classified, where the bulk of the costs are bringing it to market?). Despite
these potential problems, it may be useful to draw a distinction between cross-licensing of
existing R&D and future R&D.
        Another important incentive question is to what extent the firms will be allowed to

            Patents are granted for a term of 17 years (14 years for design patents), which may be extended only by a
special act of Congress (except for certain pharmaceutical patents). After expiration of the term, the patentee loses
rights to the invention.

 market their innovations_ The FDA and others raise legitimate concerns about allowing
 marketing of "safer" tobacco products: by providing a government imprimatur of reduced health
 risks, allowing such advertising may induce more smoking (either by non-smokers or by those
 who had intended to reduce their smoking levels). So even if each cigarette is "safer," the public
 health risk may be expanded because of the increase in total smoking relative to the baseline. To
 the extent that advertising ofsafer products is not allowed, however, firms will have little interest
 in developing such products.

          One possibility -- which may not be technically feasible -- would be to allow firms to
  publish "health hazard ratings_" For example, cigarette packages could carry health hazard
  ratings of 90, 95, or 100 depending on the risks profile of the product. 2 It seems unlikely that a
  product carrying a health hazard rating of "90" would be much more attractive to a non-smoker
  than one carrying a rating of"100." Such a system could provide firms with some incentives to
  develop safer products -- because extant smokers would pay attention to the health hazard rating
  -- while minimizing the potential for perverse results. The system would also facilitate a
. CAFE-like regulation that cigarette sales by each individual producer could have a mean health
  hazard rating of no more than some level.

 v. Options

         The above discussion suggests several possible options:

1. Maintain current provisions_ The current provisions provide limited incentives for
innovation, but strong incentives for diffusion. This solution is acceptable if we believe that
most of the knowledge about developing safer products already exists -- and there is therefore
more to be gained from disseminating what is known than from trying to develop new knowledge
and new products and technology.

2. Require full (and perhaps free) cross-licensing ofexisting knowledge but not future
discoveries. As noted above, this option would efficiently diffuse the existing stock of
knowledge without affecting firms' incentives for future investments in R&D. Future R&D
efforts could be governed by the regular patent system, or one of the options below_ One
important detail in such a system would be the delineation of existing R&D from future R&D.

3. Grant patents for a limited period. The Settlement effectively eliminates the patent period.
An intermediate position, which would provide more balance between incentives and
dissemination, would shorten the patent period from 17 years to perhaps a few years. At the end
of the patent period, other firms would have free access to the knowledge.
4. Grant patents for a limited period and then have the tobacco fund buyout the patent holder
(could be combined with #2). One solution to the tradeoff between dissemination and incentives

          2 Given the difficulty of distinguishing real health benefits, the scale should only include a few discrete
levels -- perhaps 90, 95, and 100 -- instead of being continuous.

                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


     is to have. the government buyout the patent holder and then license the knowledge to other
     producers (perhaps for a nominal fee). For example, we could grant a 2-year patent for tobacco
     products. At the end of the 2-year period, the tobacco fund would compensate the patent holder
     for some multiple (e.g., 3) of profits from the patent over that period -- a proxy for the present
     value of the profits from the patent itself. The patent will then expire, and the knowledge could
     be distributed to other firms for free or for a nominal fee, ensuring relatively rapid dissemination.
      This structure would maintain incentives for future R&D, encourage patent holders to market
     their innovations aggressively during the patent period, and ensure dissemination after the end of
     the patent period.

     5. Eliminate cross-licensing requirements. Eliminating the cross-licensing provisions would
     allow companies to profit from innovation as they would in any other industry, thus encouraging
     future R&D. Concerns about strategic withholding of innovations and the related lack of
     diffusion could be alleviated by the settlement's provision allowing the FDA to set performance
     standards. In that way, a minimum level of safety could be set for the entire industry and
     adjusted as major innovations occurred.

     VI. Summary of key points and questions

           Innovation generally requires investment -- and full disclosure coupled with free adoption
            by other firms provides little or no incentive for such investment to be undertaken.

           Enforcing full and even free cross-licensing of extant R&D may not pose the same
            incentive problems as enforcing cross-licensing of future R&D. But the government's
            credibility may suffer, and it may be difficult to define "existing" R&D.

           To the extent that the FDA does not allow advertising of safer products, firms will have
            little interest in developing such products. To counter the potential risk to public health
            from allowing advertising of "safer" cigarettes, one possibility -- which may not be
            technically feasible -- would be to allow firms to publish "health hazard ratings."

           The cross-licensing requirements embodied in the Settlement are at one extreme of
            possible patent systems. Modifications could include limiting cross-licensing to existing
            R&D, allowing a shorter-than-usual but non-zero patent period, or simply eliminating the
            cross-licensing requirements and relying on FDA regulations to encourage dissemination.
