             Clinton Administration: Protecting Children from Sex Offenders
               Registration of Federal and Military Sex Offenders Initiative
                                                May 5,1997

     Announcement
         Today, President Clinton directed the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and all
          federal law enforcement agencies to ensure that federal and military sex offenders are
          registered, both in the state in which they live and in the national sex offender registry.
          Today's directive is an important step that builds upon the Clinton Administration's
          record of protecting our children from sex offenders.

     Background
     A recent Justice Department report found that on any given day, about 60% of the 234,000
     convicted sex offenders under the are of corrections officials are living in the community, either
     on probation or parole. Over the last few years, the Clinton Administration has made protecting
     our children from sex offenders a national priority.

           The 1994 Clinton Crime Act required sex offenders to register in the state in which they
            live; increased penalties for sexual abuse offenses and certain offenses against youthful
            victims; and broadened pretrial detention for serious sex offenses cases.

           In May 1996, President Clinton signed Megan's Law to ensure that communities are
            notified when sex offenders are in their midst. In June 1996, President Clinton directed
            the Attorney General to establish a national sexual predator and child molester
            registration system. This computerized system will help link together the sex offender
            and notifications systems being developed in all 50 states.

           The national sex offender registry became operational in February-- allowing law
            enforcement agencies to search the FBI's criminal history record database to determine
            whether an individual is a registered sex offender, and if so, where he or she is registered.
             Close partnerships must be formed between the FBI and other law enforcement agencies
            to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information on the whereabouts of sex offenders is
            loaded into the system and available to those who need it.

     Today's Measure
          President Clinton's directive will ensure that federal and military sex offenders will be
           included in the national sex offender registry as soon as possible. The directive
           instructs the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense to ensure that federal and
           military authorities provide appropriate state authorities with information concerning the
           release of federal and military sex offenders.

           In addition, President Clinton has asked the Attorney General and the Secretary of
            Defense to report back to him within 60 days on any legislative changes that would be
            needed to fully implement the directive.
