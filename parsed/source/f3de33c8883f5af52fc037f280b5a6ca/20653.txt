               PASSING A STRONG PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS
                              July 16, 1998

Today, the President joined Republicans and Democrats on the Hill to support passing a strong
bipartisan patients' bill of rights this year. Following his meeting yesterday with families,
doctors, and nurses at the AMA, today the President reiterated his call on Congress to pass this
legislation before adjournment. The DingellJGanske patients' rights legislation underscores
the need to address health challenge in a bipartisan manner. Today:

The President reiterated his call on Congress to pass a strong enforceable patients' bill of
rights before they adjourn. For nine months the President has been calling on Congress to
pass a patients' bill of rights that includes: guaranteed access toneeded health care
specialists; access to emergency room services when and where the need arises; continuity
of care protections to assure patient care will not abruptly change if their provider is
dropped; access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process for
consumers to resolve their differences with their health plans; a limit on financial
incentives to doctors; assuring that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment
options; ass~ring that women have direct access to an OB-GYN. Any bill of rights should
include an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been
maimed or who have died as a result of health plan actions. A right without a meaningful
remedy is simply not a right.

The Republicans in the House and the Senate have outlined proposals that fall far short of
providing patients' the protections they need. After nine months of ignoring the President's
call for a strong, enforceable, bipartisan patients' bill of rights, the Republican Leadership has
responded with a rhetoric-laced, partisan proposals that places the interests of insurers above the
needs of patients. The fact that Republicans have yet to introduce a bill with less than 40
days left in this Congress raises serious questions as to whether they are truly committed to
passing a bill of rights or selling a bill of goods American public. The Republican
proposals fall short in many areas. For example, they:

      Do not guarantee access to specialists. We have heard again and again about
       patients who could not see oncologists or specialists to treat heart conditions or
       diabetes. The Republican proposals do not assure that patients with critical health
       needs have access to the specialists they need.

      Do not limit or require disclosure of financial incentives for doctors. Patients
       should not be put at risk by unknown destructive financial incentives to limit
       patient care.

      Do not compensate patients who are maimed or who die as a result of a wrongful
       health plan action. A right without a remedy is simply not a right. The Republican
       Leadership proposals do not have adequate recourse for patients who are maimed
       or injured by their health plans.

protections than the House proposal. It:

     Does not provide over 100 million Americans aU of the patient protections they
      need. The Senate Republican proposal only applies to Americans in self-insured plans
      and excludes the majority of Americans. Therefore, those tens of million of Americans
      excluded from these protections would only have the rights they need if every state
      passed every protection into law.

             States patients' rights laws do not provide the protections patients need. As
             a new report released by today Families USA highlights, no state has passed all of
             the protections in the patients' bill of rights, and most states have passed only a
             few of the protections.

             Unfair to Americans in small businesses. Most Americans who work in small
             businesses wo~ld not be protected by the Senate Republican proposal. The plan
             explicitly excludes these Americans from these protections and holds them
             hostage to the hope that every state will some day pass these protections.

             Inconsistent with the bipartisan Kassebaum-Kennedy law. Rejects bipartisan
             Kassebaum-Kennedy approach that guarantees insurance protections are extended
             to all Americans.

     Does not provide any enforcement provision. This is even worse than the House
      proposal which contained a weak enforcement mechanism.

The President Remains Committed to Passing a Strong, Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.
in This Congress. The President is committed to working with the Congress to pass
bipartisan legislation to provide patients the protections they need.
