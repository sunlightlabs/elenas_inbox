Education and Training:                                             Hex-Dump Conversion


      Declare End to Reading Wars -- Announce Summit_ The National Academy of
       Sciences Report on "Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children" has been
       well-received across the political spectrum, but it is not well-known. One possible event
       would be for you to respond to the report by declaring an end to the reading wars -- the
       long-running fight between "phonics" and "whole language" advocates. At one of the
       tutor training sessions being held across the country over the summer, you could call for a
       September "Reading Summit" (already being planned by Education). You could also put
       some flesh on the $3 billion Early Learning Fund in the budget, perhaps calling it the
       Marshall Plan for the end of the Reading Wars.

[ELENA: Gene wanted to make sure that you were comfortable with this idea.]
    Bilingual Education and Pre-School. We could seize on the bilingual education
     backlash to advance the goal of working towards universal pre-school. Our goal
     would be to have pre-school programs to help non-English speaking 3-4 year olds
     learn to speak English (the younger they are, the easier it is to learn; we should be
     teaching them before they get to kindergarten and then they'll be ready to learn to
     read and add like other kids). We could try to re-program funds, use existing
                                                               in
     funds will flexible authority, or try to carve out pilot an appropriations bill.

     DC Training Alliance. You could announce a Labor Department pilot program that
      would give a $1.2 million planning grant (the ~'metro-tech grant") to the DC, MD, and
      VA job-training systems to train workers to meet the demand in the high-tech industry in
      the DC, MD, and VA area. The pilot program will fund 100 workers. There is an
      expectation that this pilot will lead to a demonstration project serving 3,000 people at a
      cost of $17 million. This is ready to be announced anytime in the near future.

      School Construct,ion and Smaller Class Size Day. We could begin preparing now for
      a back-to-school week day that would focus on school construction and smaller class
      sizes. We could ask parents, volunteers, Members of Congress, and community leaders
      to join together to help rebuild/renovate/modernize their local public school. You, the
      Vice President, Mrs. Clinton, and Mrs. Gore could all participant in this construction
      effort. This would be a terrific visual and would allow Members of Congress a chance to
      highlight this important issue for the fall.

     Report on Success of School-to-Work Program. A major study is expected to be
      released soon on one of your signature programs of his first year in office,
      School-to-Work. If it is as positive as hoped, and if the right-wing's opposition
      continues to be an issue, this might be an appropriate time to take on the right-wing and
      further energize the business community in support of Democrats' efforts. We are not
      sure of the timing of this report. Moreover, our budget scales back the school-to-work
      program (from $400 million to $250 million) as it sunsets according to law.


Individual Development Accounts:

     Endorse Coats-Harkin Bill. You could announce your endorsement of the
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
      Coats-Harkin IDA demonstration bill in Congress. One possible event idea would be to
      go to a community development bank and help a welfare recipient open a bank account --
      this would allow us to push for CDFI funding at the same time. Another idea would be
      to do a more simple Rose Garden event with the sponsors of the bill and welfare
      recipients, and push this as part of our welfare-to-work efforts.


Pensions:

     Pensions Proposals. Your advisors have reached consensus on two pension proposals
      (in addition to the proposals announced in January). The joint and
      two-thirds/three-quarters survivor annuity proposal would increase benefits for some
      surviving spouses of pension plan participants, while the other proposal, initially
      advanced by Rep. Price (D-NC), would allow workers to count FMLA time toward
      pension vesting requirements. This would ensure that those (relatively few) workers
      close to the 1,OOO-hour minimum requirement for vesting do not lose a year of vesting
      because oftime taken off under FMLA. This can be billed as a women's pension item.

Rural Agenda:

     Rural Economic Development. There are several potential rural economic initiatives
      that the Administration could roll out over the summer or fall. These focus in particular
      on education, agriculture, housing, trade, and health care. We would work together on
      some of these and other potential initiatives.

     Rural Press ConferencelRegional Press Opportunities. We may want to consider
      announcing different elements of a rural economic development initiative through a radio
      press conference which you, the Vice President, and Sec. Glickman could jointly hold.
      We have done this successfully in the past, particularly with respect to budget initiatives.
      In addition, we might want to devote a weekly radio address to rural issues as well. Both
      of these hits could be part of a broader rural economic rollout in which we have Cabinet
      heads and subcabinet officials conduct media in targeted rural markets across the country.

Housing:

      HUD-NAR "One America" Agreement. HUD and the National Association of
      Realtors (NAR) have reached a final agreement on the "One America Broker" program.
      Under the program, NAR will sponsor training for real estate professionals on how to
      better serve minority and immigrant home buyers. The training will address adherence
      to Fair Housing Act principles, as well as ways to expand the housing choices available to
      minorities and other underserved groups. Realtors who complete the course and commit
      to serving these groups would be able to use the "One America" logo in advertising and
      promotional materials, which could help them to attract additional clients. To be
      certified, realtors must be free of any Fair Housing Act violations. The agreement could
      be announcedlhighlighted by you or the Vice President at an event with, e.g., a minority
      or immigrant new home buyer who previously experience discrimination and (possibly) a
      realtor with an outstanding record serving underserved groups.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
Technology:

[COMBINE WITH OTHER DISABILITY PROPOSAL]
   Initiative on Technology for Americans with Disabilities. New infonnation technologies
    can substantially increase the quality oflife for the 55 million Americans with disabilities.
    For example -- speech recognition, text-to-speech, computers that can be manipulated with
    eye movements as opposed to a mouse -- can all allow Americans with disabilities to lead
    more independent lives and increase their ability to get a job. The backdrop for this event
    could be demonstrations of the technology. Deliverables could be:
    o Announcement of Technology Task Force of President's Committee on
            Employment of People with Disabilities.
    o FY2000 budget initiative (R&D to develop better technologies, programs to
            educate engineers to design accessible technology).
    o       Government commitment to purchase "accessible" technology [This is part of the
            "01" bill.]



International Economics:

      Trade Adjustment Assistance. We could do an event on helping everyone benefit from
        a global economy. This event could have four different components, focused on both
       worker and cornmunity adjustment:
       o      You could announce the consolidation and refonn of the Trade Adjustment
              Assistance (TAA) program and the NAFTA-TAA program. This would more
              than fulfill the President's promise to strengthen the TAAINAFTA-TAA
              programs during the fast track debate.
       o A possible Executive Order establishing a coordinating committee on community
              adjustment issues. This could be modeled after the Executive Order on defense
              adjustment programs.
       o You would call on Congress to pass his EDA budget and NADBank budget, so
              that we can effectively deal with communities that have severe and sudden
              economic distress.
       o      Memorandum of Understanding between NADBank and EDA so that they work
              better together. This is important to Rep. Torres and the Hispanic Caucus.
              NADBanklCAIP and EDA have done a lot of work together, but it could be an
              important symbolic message to the Hispanic Caucus for the relationship between
              the two to be fonnalized.

      Sanctions Policy. You could announce the release of a Presidential Decision Directive
       on Sanctions which would establish a joint NEC/NSC interagency sanctions review group
       to monitor and coordinate broad United States government sanctions policy. The group
       would ensure that prior to sanctions being implemented the Administration would
       conduct a costlbenefit analysis. The group could also review existing sanctions in place
       to detennine whether they are still serving an important purpose in fulfilling our policy
       objectives. The time could be ripe for such an announcement because of the keen
       awareness on the Hill and elsewhere about the proliferation of new sanctions regimes and
       their cost to the U.S. economy. An interagency process has been working on such a
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
      directive; work could be finalized in time for an announcement. Because the Glenn
      Amendment has crystallized opinion about the problems with unilateral sanctions, this
      can and should be done sooner rather than later (e.g., over the next couple of weeks).

     Major International Trade Speech. You could articulate U.S. trade objectives for the
      year leading up to the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference, which we are hosting. You
      could also announce the selection of the city for such an announcement. Over 20 cities
      have expressed interest; the conference will bring international attention and over 10,000
      attendees from foreign government, business, press and NGOs. The policy initiative
      would be a refinement of the goals outlined at the May 1998 WTO Anniversary in Geneva.


Financial:

[NEED TO REVISE RE: SARAH ROSEN'S COMMENTS]
    Consumer Financial Bill of Rights. Working with the DPC, we could potentially
     develop a consumer financial bill of rights. One possible example could be to do
     something about ATM fees.
