   With the strong urging and support of the President and the First Lady, the Congress is working
    to pass historic, bipartisan legislation on adoption before the congressional recess.

   Last spring, the House of Representatives passed the Adoption Promotion Act of 1997,
    sponsored by Representatives Camp and Kennelly, with the strong support of the President.

   On Saturday evening, November 8, 1997, with the strong urging ofthe Administration, the
    Senate passed by unanimous consent the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for
    Abused and Neglected Children Act, sponsored by Senators Chafee and Rockefeller.

   With the close involvement of the Adminstration, the House of Representatives and the Senate
    are working to resolve the differences in their two bills and pass an adoption bill before the
    recess to ensure that a bill reaches the President's desk this year.

   The pending legislation builds on the commitment of the President to at least double the
    number of children from the child welfare system who are adopted or placed in permanent
    homes by the year 2002. It incorporates recommendations made by the Administration's
    Adoption 2002 report to provide states with financial incentives to increase the number of
    children adopted and to make other changes in federal law that will make adoption easier and
    move children more quickly out of foster care and into permanent homes.

   The President and the First Lady are committed to improving our nation's child welfare system
    for the thousands of children who come to rely on it because their own homes jeopardize their
    health or well-being. Today, approximately 500,000 of America's children live in our nation's
    foster care system.

   The President and the First Lady have worked hard on this legislation. Last December, the
    President directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct wide consultations
    and report to him with specific recommendations for legislative and administrative strategies to
    move children more rapidly from foster care to permanent homes and to meet the goal of at
    least doubling adoption.s and other permanent placements by the year 2002.

   Issuing the Executive Memorandum on adoption in a radio address, the President said, "With
    this effort we're saying no child should be trapped in the limbo of foster care; no child should
    be uncertain what the word "family" or "parent" or "home" mean, particularly when there are
    open arms waiting to welcome these children into safe and strong households, where they can
    build good, caring lives." [December 16, 1997]

   On Valentine's Day, 1997, the President received the formal recommendations for legislative
    and administrative action -- in a report called Adoption 2002 -- in an Oval Office ceremony.
    There, he committed to (1) making sure that children's health and safety are the paramount

                                                1

             concerns of the child welfare system; (2) meeting the goal of doubling the number of adoptions
             each year by working with states to set state-by-state annual targets and to provide assistance
             for innovative strategies; (3) proposing legislation to give bonuses to states for each adoption
             over the prior year's total, with larger bonuses for adoptions of children with special needs;
             (4) working with Congress to shorten the time a child in foster care waits for a court hearing;
             (5) establishing national awards for excellence in promoting adoption; and (6) redoubling
             efforts to make sure that no child of one race is deprived of a loving home when a child of
             another race is prepared to give it.

            Committing to aggressive legislative and administrative action, the President said "Putting this
             plan into place today will mean that we are ensuring that no child will languish in foster care."
             [February 14, 1997]

            The Adoption Promotion Act of 1997, which the House of Representatives passed last spring
             and the President's strongly supported, reflects the President's priorities. The Senate bill
             currently under consideration also reflects the President's priorities and commitment to
             improving our nation's child welfare system. The Administration is very hopeful that a bill
             will reach the President's desk this year.

            Ifpassed, this legislation would build on the President's strong record on promoting adoption.
              For example, the President has:

             Made adoption more affordable for families by signing into law the Small Business Job
             Protection Act of 1996, which provides a $5,000 tax credit for families adopting children and a
             $6,000 tax credit for families adopting children with special needs;

             Broke down racial and ethnic barriers to adoption by signing the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act in
             1994 and by strengthening it through the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 to ensure
             that the adoption process is free from discrimination and delays on the basis of race, culture and
             ethnicity; and

             Provided supports for child protection and adoption by signing the into law the Family and
             Medical Leave Act in 1993, which enables parents to take time off to adopt a child without
             losing their jobs or health insurance and ensuring that the welfare reform law maintained the
             guarantee of child protection and adoption, and did not reduce funds for child welfare, child
             abuse, foster care and adoption service.

            November is National Adoption Month. Last week, the President issued an proclamation,
             which urged, "As a Nation, we have before us an opportunity to make a real difference in
             the lives of our most vulnerable children. As we observe National Adoption Month, we
             reaffirm our commitment to adoption as a new beginning for thousands of children, and
             we celebrate the many American families who have embraced these children by accepting
             the rewards and responsibilities of adoption." [November 4, 1997]
