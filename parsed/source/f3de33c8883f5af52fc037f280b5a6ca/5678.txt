TEXT:
As I mentioned in our team leaders meeting, Cuomo is pushing for more
money.  He is already $1.4 billion ahead of last year in Budget
Authority. In his latest memo to Erskine, he misleads the COS on several
issues.  For example, he can do a set-aside in CDBG for Homeownership
Zones.

I think John's memo describes many of the problems with Cuomo's memo.
Officer Next Door is already funded at last year's levels and Eddie Mac,
which is a new program is getting $400 million (more than enough for such
an untested idea). We should oppose any additional increases since it will
only cut away at other Presidential priority areas inside and outside
HUD's budget (e.g. vouchers, child care, community prosecutors).

We have asked that Jason Goldberg hold this memo to Erskine and not
forward it to the President at this time.

MEMORANDUM FOR GENE SPERLING

FROM:              JONORSZAG

SUBJECT:           HUD's Budget


       Here's a quick memo responding to Secretary Cuomo's memo from this afternoon.

        Before I go into the specifics of what HUD is now requesting, I wanted to describe some
of the initiatives that they already have in their budget. First of all, HUD has a $1.5 billion
increase in their BA for FY99 afyou include Presidential initiatives). In terms of increased
funding or new initiatives, they have a $341 million increase in homeless assistance, $283
million for Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers, $400 million for a Community Empowerment
Fund ("Eddie Mac"), $143 million more for public housing construction and capital
improvements, $50 million increase in the HOME program, $50 million increase in CDBO
funding, and $11 million for a Homeownership Opportunity Fund. Across the board, their
programs got more funding, except housing assistance for the elderly..

HUD wants increased funding for the following programs:

      Homeownership Zones. In their budget request, HUD asked for $50 million for
       Homeownership Zones. The passback included no funding. You should know that
       Secretary Cuomo had $920 million of budget authority to decide on his own how to
       allocate and he chose to fund 20 or so other programs. He did not provide funding for.
       Homeownership Zones. You should also know that last year the $50 million for
       HomeowI).ership Zones was funded out of the CDBO program, as a set aside. In the
       FY99 budget, HUD had $200 million of set asides in the CDBO program to allocate on
       their own, but HUD chose not to include funding for Homeownership Zones.

              A Couple of Solutions. One solution would be to take $25 million from the $50
              million increase in CDBO, and use it to fund Homeownership Zones. We could
              then say that we had a $25 million increase in CDBO and $25 million for
              Homeownership Zones. Another alternative -- with similar effect -- would be to
              take a $25-$50 million set aside within CDBO and say that we had a $50 million
              increase in CDBO with $25-$50 million for Homeownership Zones.

      Community Empowerment Fund. HUD originally asked for $1 billion for their
       Community Empowerment Fund idea. The budget currently includes $400 million.
       HUD now wants an additional $600 million for this effort. While most like this idea in
       principle, some arevery concerned about the specifics ofHUD's proposal. Regardless
       of what level of funding this initiative receives. I strongly believe that the NECIDPC
       needs to run a process to ensure that this proposal is sound.
      Officer Next Door Program. HUD wants to greatly expand their Officer Next Door
"
                                                                       . Hex-Dump Conversion
        program by providing another $30 million. They would use this increased funding to
        provide incentives for police officers to buy homes in troubled areas. These incentives
        would include downpayment and closing costs assistance and deeply discounted home
        improvement loans.

       Public Housing Homeownership Vouchers. This proposal, which has not been vetted
        at all within the Administration, would provide qualified graduates of public and assisted
        housing the opportunity to buy a home using a Section 8 voucher and up to $5,000 in
        downpaymentlclosing cost assistance. This proposal would help 25,000 families become
        homeowners, at a cost of $245 million in FY99.

       Fair Housing. Secretary Cuomo asks for an additional $7 million to allow HUn to take
        even more Fair Housing actions. It is unclear what Sec. Cuomo is asking for: in FY98,
        HUn received $30 million for enforcement. Their passback included $44 million, which
        has subsequently increased to $52 million. That means that the FY99 budget is now $22
        million above their FY98 level -- that's an increase of73 percent.
