MEMORANDUM FOR

FROM:

SUBJECT:

As you know, we have praised the McCain bill as a significant step forward, noting that it raises
the price of cigarettes by $l.l0, assures FDA full authority to regulate tobacco, and protects
farmers and farming communities. We also believe we need several key changes to the McCain
bill to ensure it will meet our goals of reducing youth smoking and protecting the public health.

Youth Lookback Penalties

We believe that providing individual companies with a financial incentive to reduce youth
smoking will help ensure we meet our goal of reducing youth smoking by 60 percent within 10
years. Currently, the McCain bill levies an industry-wide surcharge when the targets are missed,
a cost which companies will pass onto consumers. We would recommend a company specific
surcharge developed by our experts at Treasury and HHS, which would impose a $1000 fee for
every child by which a company misses the targets (i.e., if a company missed the target by
10,000 children, they would pay a fee of $10,000,000). A $1000 per child surcharge is twice
average company yearly profits per smoker.

Currently, the McCain bill caps industry-wide penalties at $3.5 billion. This means that the
surcharge would increase the price by $.30 per pack at most, no matter how much the industry
misses the youth smoking targets by. Because the price increase resulting from industry wide
penalties will provide additional deterrence to youth tobacco use, we believe we should lift the
cap from $3.5 to $4 to $5 billion.

We also recommend revising the McCain penalty language to ensure that both company and
industry surcharges are levied based on objective outcomes. The current language requiring the
federal government to show that companies engaged in bad behavior in addition to missing the


Price per Pack and Spending

Price per Pack

As you know, many in the public health community argue that $1.50 per pack price increase is
needed to significantly reduce youth smoking. We do not believe, however, that we should
push for an additional increase in the annual industry payments in the McCain bill, because we
believe that Congressional scorekeepers will estimate that the yearly payments in the bill will
increase the price of cigarettes by nearly $1.50 per pack rather than the $1.10 we estimated. The
price per pack estimate would increase if the scorekeepers assume that 1) states will use the
opportunity to increase state excise taxes, further reducing the number of packs smoked and 2)
the bill will significantly increase the black market for cigarettes, resulting in fewer than expected
packs sold through the legitimate retail market. By reducing the number of expected packs sold,
both of these changes would increase the per pack price estimate because the annual industry
payment set in legislation would be spread among fewer packs, raising the price of each more.

Spending

We expect bipartisan consensus on 75-80 percent of the spending ($10 billion over 5 years
for farmers; $10 billion for cessation, counteradvertising, and other public health
programs; $10-15 billion for NIH; and $20-25 billion for states). The battle will be over
how to divide up the remaining $15 billion or so. Senate Republicans will seek money for
Medicare; House Republicans may push Rep. Archer's proposal for health care tax
deductions for small business and the self-employed; and Democrats will push for
everything from child care to school construction.

As you know, in our budget, we earmark 57 percent of the state funding for child care, class size,
and Medicaid outreach initiatives. As we go forward, we should argue at a minimum that a
significant portion of the state funds should be used for state programs such as child care and
education that are defined in a menu-like list in the legislation. For example, in the
Harkin-Chafee bill, half of the state funds must be spent on one of 20 listed programs, which
include child care, K-12 education, Medicaid, the Child Health Insurance Program, and Head
Start.

Antitrust Exemption

The McCain bill contains antitrust exemptions for the tobacco industry which are not necessary to
achieve the goals of the legislation and may have serious anticompetitive effects. The antitrust
exemption is not necessary to ensure that distributors and retailers don't sell tobacco products to
minors nor to allow companies to enter into agreements with the federal or state governments.
necessary to restrict advertising and marketing to children.




                                               3

As part of the public health spending noted above, we believe it is important to include
significant funding ($200 million a year) for international tobacco control efforts. We believe
these funds should be spent on both governmental and non-governmental efforts to promote
public health and smoking prevention efforts abroad. Such funds could be used to provide
technical assistance to public health departments in other countries and finance diplomatic,
media-related and grass-roots efforts to discourage youth smoking abroad.

The McCain bill has several international provisions which we believe should be amended to
ensure that they do not interfere with our diplomatic and trade priorities. For example, we
support the bill's effort to prohibit U.S. government support for promotion of tobacco overseas,
but need to ensure that the language does not interfere with USTR's ability to negotiate tariff
reductions or interfere with treatment of other products. In addition, the McCain bill contains a
provision which the State Department and HHS consider problematic and unenforceable, which
would require U.S. companies to abide by the new advertising and marketing restrictions when
doing business in other countries. Instead, we recommend that we work on a multilateral basis
through the World Health Organization to encourage other countries to adopt laws like ours.

Environmental Tobacco Smoke

We have serious concerns about the McCain bill's provisions which would allow individual states
to "opt out" of the environmental tobacco smoke provisions that ensure public facilities are smoke
free. This provision creates a patchwork system in which states could decide to adopt weaker
laws or decide against taking any action at all, leaving many children with little or no protection
from the hazards of second hand smoke.

Preemption

We believe the bill's preemption provisions may go too far in preventing state and local
governments from enacting tougher anti-smoking laws if they so choose and may unfairly end
local lawsuits with the tobacco industry without including local governments as beneficiaries of
industry payments. [checking].

Constitutional Issues

We are prepared to recommend changes to the advertising, marketing, and other free
speech-related provisions to ensure they are narrowly tailored to meet the government's
compelling interest in protecting children. Provisions regulating non-commercial speech, such
as forbidding companies from lobbying Congress, are particularly problematic and should be
removed.
