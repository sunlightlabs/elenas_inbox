                          MEDICARE TRUSTEES' REPORT:                              1999
                                                 March 30,1999


         Today, the Medicare Trustees projected that the life o/the Medicare Trust Fund has been
         extended until 2015 -- 7 years longer than projected in last year's report. This report affirms
         that the President's commitment to strengthening and improving Medicare is paying dividends,
         but it also underscores the need/or additional action to strengthen and improve the program.

             The Trustees' Report on the Improved Financial Status of Medicare is Good News and
              Reflects that the Hard Choices the President Made in 1993 and 1997 Strengthened the
              Program and Were Justified. When the President came into office, the Medicare program
              was projected by the Trustees to go bankrupt by 1999. The Trustees' Report validates the
              President's economic policies. It reports that: "income exceeded expectations as a result of
              robust economic growth and expenditures declined due to implementation of the Balanced
              Budget Act of 1997, low increases in health care costs generally, and continuing efforts to
              combat fraud and abuse." In the last few years, the life of the Trust Fund has been extended
              by a full 14 years and the actuarial deficit has been cut by two-thirds.

              Good News Does Not Delay the Need for Decisive Action. We are proud of our
               stewardship of the Medicare program. However, our success does not in any way diminish
               the challenges facing Medicare, Under any scenario, enrollment in Medicare will climb from
               39 million to 47 million in 2010, and to 80 million by 2035. As the Trustees' Report points
               out, "substantially greater changes in income and/or outlays are needed, in large part as a
               result of the impending retirement of the baby boom generation."

              The President's Proposal to Modernize Medicare and to Dedicate 15 Percent of the
               Surplus to the Program is Clearly Necessary to Adequately Extend the Life of the
               Trust Fund and Add a Long Overdue Prescription Drug Benefit. While the financial
               well-being of the Medicare program has improved, its reserves will become exhausted just
               as the baby boom population begins to retire and long before those of the Social Security
               program. Moreover, 15 million beneficiaries have absolutely no prescription drug
               coverage, millions more have totally inadequate coverage, and our nation's elderly are
               paying excessively high costs for their desperately needed medications. The President's
               Medicare reform proposal will address these unmet challenges.

              We Now Face A Historic Fiscal Choice: Do we use the surplus to strengthen and
               modernize Medicare and keep the program solvent further into the future OR do we
               use it to provide for an exploding and irresponsible tax cut. If we choose unwisely and
               use the surplus to finance tax cuts -- rather than Social Security and Medicare -- we
               will have made one of the most short-sighted fiscal decisions in our nation's history.
               Not only will we leave two programs unacceptably weakened, but we will have given
               up on an unprecedented opportunity to reduce our nation's debt from 44 percent of
               GDP to 7 percent by 2014 -- the lowest level since 1917. We must use this historic
               opportunity to strengthen Medicare by devoting 15 percent of the budget surplus to
               this program over the next 15 years and modernizing Medicare to help fund a
               prescription drug benefit.
