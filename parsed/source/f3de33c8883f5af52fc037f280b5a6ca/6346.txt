    PRESIDENT CLINTON RENEWS CALL FOR COMPREHENSIVE TOBACCO
             LEGISLATION THAT REDUCES YOUTH SMOKING
                          February 13, 1998

Today, President Clinton released a new Treasury Department analysis which concludes that the
comprehensive tobacco legislation he has called on Congress to pass would keep 1.4 million to
1.9 million children from smoking by 2003. Comprehensive legislation would make a
significant reduction in our most devastating and preventable health problem. Every day, 3,000
young people start smoking and 1,000 of them will die prematurely from a tobacco-related
disease. Over three million teenagers -- more than 22 percent of high school students -- smoke
cigarettes on a daily basis. Another 2 million smoke on a casual basis and are at risk of
becoming chronic daily users.

The President Announced That His Tobacco Proposal Could Prevent Up To 1.9 Million
Children From Smoking By 2003. The Treasury Department's study is based on conservative
estimates from well-respected analytical models. It concludes that the Administration's
proposal to increase the price of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack -- coupled with proposed sales and
advertising restrictions -- would:

      Keep 1.4 to 1.9 million Americans from smoking in 2003 - a 39 percent to 46 percent
       reduction in youth smoking.

      Over the next five years, the cumulative number of young people kept from smoking
       would be in the range of about 2.4 to 2.8 million.

      The direct result of these policies over the next five years is that as many as 1 million of
       today's young people will be spared from premature deaths resulting from
       smoking-related diseases.

The President Reaffirmed His Commitment To The Five Key Principles That Must Be At
The Heart Of Any National Tobacco Legislation. .

      A comprehensive plan to reduce youth smoking, including: tough penalties on tobacco
       firms that continue to market to youths; price increases; public education and counter
       advertising; and expanded efforts to restrict access and limit appeal.

      Full authority of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.

      Changes in how the tobacco industry does business, including an end to marketing and
       promotion to children and broad document disclosure.

      Progress towards other public goals, including a reduction of secondhand smoke;
       promotion of cessation programs; public health research; the strengthening of
       international efforts to control tobacco; and other urgent priorities.

      Protection for tobacco farmers and their communities.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
21ST CENTURY RESEARCH FUND FOR AMERICA
The President also renewed his call for a 21 st Century Research Fund for America, which makes
unprecedented increases and a multi-year investment in some of the most promising biomedical
and scientific research. Highlights from the Trust Fund include:

      An Historic Investment in Medical Research. To build on the progress in biomedical
       research, the Fund contains a historic up-front investment in biomedical research - a
       $1.15 billion increase in FY 1999 - at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and
       increased funding of nearly 50 percent over the next five years. Under the President's
       proposal, the NIH will devote over $20 billion to biomedical research in 2003. This
       increases funding at all of the Institutes at NIH, including a 65 percent increase in cancer
       research funding. The Fund also includes a $25 million for a new Prevention Research
       Program at CDC to identify interventions that prevent diseases as well as we a $25
       million increase in quality and health outcomes research at the Agency of Health Care
       Policy and Research (AHCPR) which will help bridge the gap between what scientists
       know and the health care Americans receive.

      National Science Foundation. The Fund also supports a $344 million increase in NSF
       -- the largest increase ever - in FY 1999 bringing NSF spending to $3.7 billion. This
       new funding will advance NSF's broad mission of promoting science and engineering
       research and education across all fields and disciplines.

       National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Fund supports makes
       a renewed commitment to essential NASA activities, including a $2.1 billion increase for
       Space Science leading to a more robotic exploration of the solar system.

       Department of Energy. The Fund provides $2.7 billion for DoE's science research and
       nuclear fusion programs.

       Department of Commerce. It also provides $851 million for the National Institutes of
       Standards and Technology (NIST) Advanced Technology Program and Oceanic and
       Atmospheric Research activities.

President Stated His Desire To Work With Democrats and Republicans to Enact
Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation This Year. The President applauded Senator Conrad for
introducing comprehensive tobacco legislation which meets the Administration's five goals.
His bill adds to the momentum for comprehensive legislation, and serves as a challenge to all
other Members to work toward this goal. The President will also support other bills that meet
his principles, whether introduced by Democrats or Republicans. He looks forward to working
with as many Members as possible on the issues involved in comprehensive legislation.
