[Draft POTUS Letter to the Senate with Bruce's edits]


                                           May 19,1998



        I applaud the Senate for taking up comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to dramatically
reduce teen smoking. Every day, 3000 teenagers start smoking, and 1000 will die prematurely
of smoking-related diseases as a result. I urge the Senate to move swiftly to pass comprehensive
legislation that could save those children's lives.

       Last September, and in my budget plan, I set forth five principles for comprehensive
tobacco legislation:

              Raising the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over 5 years and $1.50 a pack
               over the next ten years, with extra surcharges on companies that continue to sell to
               kids;

              Affirming the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;

              Getting companies out of the business of marketing and selling tobacco to minors;

              Promoting public health research and public health goals; and

              Protecting our tobacco farmers and their communities.

        The bill before the Senate, as amended by Senator McCain's Manager's Amendment,
meets those five principles, and I would be pleased to sign it into law. This is a good, strong bill
that will make a real dent in teen smoking.

        I applaud Senators McCain, Hollings, Kerry, and others in both parties who have worked
hard to strengthen this legislation. I am particularly pleased that the bill contains significant
improvements which will help reduce youth smoking and protect the public health:

      Tough industry-wide and company-specific lookback surcharges that will ,finally make
       reducing youth smoking the tobacco companies' bottom line;

      Protection for all Americans from the health hazards of secondhand smoke in public
       buildings;

      No antitrust exemption for the tobacco industry;

      Strong licensing and anti-smuggling provisions to prevent the emergence of contraband
       markets and prosecute violators;
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

      A dedicated trust fund to provide for a substantial increase in health research funding as
       we move into the 21 st Century, a nationwide counteradvertising campaign to reduce
       youth smoking, effective state and local programs in tobacco education, prevention, and
       cessation, law enforcement efforts to prevent smuggling and crack down on retailers who
       sell tobacco products to children, assistance for tobacco farmers and their communities,
       and funds for the states to make additional efforts to promote public health and protect
       children; and

      A higher, $8-billion-a-year cap on legal damages, which will only be available to tobacco
       companies that finally change the way they do business, by agreeing to accept sweeping
       restrictions on advertising, continue making annual payments and lookback surcharges
       even if those provisions are struck down, make substantial progress toward meeting the
       youth smoking reduction targets, prevent their tQP management from taking part in any
       scheme to promote smuggling, and abide by the terms of the legislation rather than tying
       it up in court.

       I strongly support these improvements, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation
without delay.

        I am deeply troubled by the Senate Leadership's recent attempt to undermine protection
for tobacco farmers and their communities. [A few sentences on LEAF]

       In addition, I do hope the Senate will reconsider certain provisions which affect the
sovereignty ofIndian tribes.

        I thank the Senate Leadership for bringing this bill to the floor in such an expeditious
manner and I urge all Senators to vote for S.1415 as amended by the Manager's Amendment, and
to quickly send it to my desk for signature.
