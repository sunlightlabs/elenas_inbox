TEXT:
Attached are revised and expanded talking points on California and
Texas.   I had hoped to incorporate some ideas from Leslie Thornton, who
is doing something for McCurry on this, but I haven't received anything
from her yet.   If we get more time, I would like to try to shorten and
polish this some more.  Thanks.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 =================

Declining Minority College Admissions and Enrollments (DRAFT --July 21, 1997)

Question:    Are you concerned about reports of declining enrollments of minority students in
             postsecondary education, such as in California and Texas?

Answer:      These trends are disturbing and completely unacceptable. Educational
             opportunity is the touchstone of the American dream, and these declines raise a
             serious concern that the doors of college education are being closed to minority
             students. In addition, diversity in education helps prepare all our students to be
             productive citizens in the 21 st century, so these developments should concern
             every American.


Question:    What is your administration doing to address this problem?

Answer:      We are working on several fronts to address this issue:

      Support for Affirmative Action and Enforcement of Federal Civil Rights Law

            We will continue to intervene in litigation in support of appropriate affinnative
             action programs. The Department of Education is looking for a good opportunity
             to challenge the Hopwood decision, and the Department of Justice has filed a brief
             challenging California's Proposition 209.

            In response to a complaint, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has indicated that it
             will investigate the current admissions policies at the three University of
             California law schools to determine if they violate federal civil rights law by
             discriminating against minority students.

            OCR is also conducting a review of the Texas higher education system to ensure
             that Texas has eliminated all remnants of its former de jure segregated system.

      Support for Creative, Race-Neutral Means to Achieve Diversity in Higher
      Education

            Secretary Riley, Education General Counsel (and now Executive Director for the
             President's Race Panel) Judy Winston, OCR Director Norma Cantu, and others in
             the Administration have been pressing higher education officials to maintain and
             expand diversity, and offering assistance to them to do so. For example, we have
             called on colleges and universities burdened by new legal restrictions to develop
             new and creative approaches to achieving diversity, such as aggressively
             recruiting in secondary schools with high percentages of minority students and
             forming educational partnerships with such schools.

                   We strongly encourage those who share our concerns about these trends to
                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                help us make the case for affirmative action and at the same time get
                involved in state and local efforts in California and Texas to find effective
                alternative routes to achieve diversity in higher education -- for example,
                to review and weigh in on the recent draft report of the University of
                California's Outreach Task Force, and to follow closely the
                implementation of Texas' new law that guarantees state university
                admission to the students in the top percentage of every high school's
                graduating class.

    Support for Efforts to Improve K-12 Education in Disadvantaged Communities and
    to Open the Doors Wide to College

               Through the new, $350 million initiative to recruit and prepare high
                quality teachers for poor urban and rural areas that the President
                announced last week, through greater access to technology such as the
                E-rate, and through other initiatives such as Goals 2000 and increased
                Title I funds for extra help in basic and advanced skills for disadvantaged
                students, this Administration has been working hard to raise K-12
                achievement for all students and help them prepare for college and high
                wage jobs.

               The President's proposed budget would open the doors to college through
                the largest increase in Pell Grants in 25 years, a large increase in
                work-study funding, and our tax proposal to make the 13th and 14th years
                of college virtually universal and help people pay for two additional years
                of college.
