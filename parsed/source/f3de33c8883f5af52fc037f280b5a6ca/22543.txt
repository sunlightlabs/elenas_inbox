Talking Points:
 The Fundamentals of           President Clinton's FY 2000 Budget:
          Investing in the Future while Maintaining Fiscal Discipline


A Return to Fiscal Strength:

      The 2000 budget anticipates the third consecutive budget surplus -- the first time we have
       seen back-to-back-to-back surpluses in half a century.

      Our remarkable fiscal and economic strength -- a balanced budget and unprecedented
       economic prosperity, including unemployment and inflation at a three decade low and
       homeownership at a record high -- is not an accident.

      The President began this virtuous cycle with his 1993 economic plan, founded on
       reducing the deficit, making strategic investments in the American people, and engaging
       in the international economy. In 1992, the budget deficit stood at a record $290 billion.
       Now we have achieved balance and can anticipate surpluses for decades to come.

Balancing Strategic Investments for the Future with Fiscal Discipline:

      The President's 2000 budget adopts the same framework that has lead to our fiscal and
       economic success. It advances strategic investments and maintains fiscal discipline.

      The 2000 budget, with its many important priorities and initiatives in education and
       training, research, the environment, health, childcare and other programs for families,
       economic development, law enforcement, foreign policy and defense -- is fully paid for. It
       complies with budget rules that have served as tools to help enforce fiscal discipline; it
       meets the discretionary caps on spending and the pay-as-you-go budget ru~es.

      Our challenge as we move forward to the next century is to maintain the same fiscal
       discipline that led to this budgetary and economic success, while continuing strategic
       investments in the American people that will strengthen our nation for the future, and
       benefit the next generation.

      As the President suggested in his State of the Union address two weeks ago, this is
       defining moment that will greatly determine the character of our country at the end of the
       21st century. We can build on this strong fiscal foundation, or we can sweep it away.

Use the Surplus to Save Social Security First:

. W e must save Social Security First: The President has already committed 62 per cent of
   our projected budget surplus for the next 15 years -- enough to extend Social Security's
   solvency to 2055. He is calling for a bipartisan process for additional reforms to extend
      solvency through 2075.        /fex-Dwnp Conversion



     After we achieve Social Security refonn, the budget makes further commitments of the
      surplus for strategic investment priorities to strengthen the nation for the future.

     The President proposes to dedicate 15 percent of the surplus to the Medicare trust fund,
      whose financial security is threatened even sooner than Social Security. In 1997, the
      President and the Congress worked together to make Medicare financially sound through
      2010. The President's 2000 budget would extend that lifetime ten years further, to 2020.
       The commitment of the surplus will help a bipartisan effort - including the current
      Medicare Commission -        go even farther. The President wants to consider, as a part of
      this refonn process, expanding Medicare coverage to include prescription drugs.

     The President also proposes using 12 percent of the surplus to finance his new Universal
      Savings Accounts - "USAs." He believes that the USA is the right kind of tax cut --
      fiscally responsible, targeted toward for the future, and helping the many American
      families who have the most difficulty saving for their retirement. This proposal includes
      seed money for Federal contributions, plus additional funds for matching contributions
      for individual workers who invest their own funds. The matching contributions will
      provide a larger percentage inducement for low-wage workers.

     The budget proposes that the remaining 11 percent of the surplus be dedicated to other
      important priorities - including education, National security, and health care. The
      President's budget is a sound, disciplined way to provide the resources needed for these
      priorities.

     We must use this opportunity to fix Social Security and then proceed to address
      Medicare, USA accounts, and our pressing investment priorities.

Rise to the Moment:

     The 2000 budget is a model for the new era of surplus. It maintains fiscal discipline,
      strategic investment, and uses the surplus to save Social Security First: As the President
      said in the State of the Union, "With our budget surplus growing, our economy
      expanding, our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our
      historic responsibility to the 21st Century. Let's get to work."
