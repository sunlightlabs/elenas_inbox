Welfare
      Our efforts to refonn the nation's welfare system have benefitted millions of people,
       many of whom are members of the minority community. Since January 1993, the
       welfare rolls have plummetted by over 20 percent -- a total of2.9 million. A recent
      study by my Council of Economic Advisors showed that, while about 40% of the decline
      in the welfare caseload is due to the strong economy we have, about a third is due to the
       welfare waivers my Administration granted to 43 states, so that they could change the
      structure of their welfare programs.

      The welfare law that I signed will help us achieve our goal oftransfonning welfare from a
       way oflife to a second chance. To make work pay better than welfare, we significantly
       increased the minimum wage; and we expanded the earned income tax credit to help 40
       million Americans. The new law provides an additional $4 billion for child care. We
       have increased child support collections dramatically -- by 50%. Now we are working to
       make transportation available for those leaving welfare for work and to expand health
       care coverage for the children oflow-income working parents. We have urged the
       corporate community to do its part, and a new Welfare to Work Partnership has been
       launched to lead the welfare to work effort in the business community and extend job
       opportunities for those seeking to remake their lives.

[Elena FYI: BBS, DOL, DOJ, ED, and maybe EEOC are working together on a joint
letter to states, in response to the Leadership Conference's letter. It would not be formal
guidance, but an education piece for states as to which anti-discrimination laws are
relevant (Title VI, ADA, age discrimination). It will give examples of problematic
situations, and offer states technical assistance. It's still probably a few weeks away from
being done. It's weak and voluntary enough that it probably doesn't work to ask them to
speed it up for the speech, but who knows ....]

      When I signed the welfare law, I stated that I opposed portions of the law that had nothing
       to do with moving people from welfare to work, and that I would work for changes to the
       law. I refer, of course, to the benefit cuts to legal immigrants and to the cuts in the food
       stamp program. Initially, no one thought we could get any changes to the law, but I am
       pleased that the budget agreement we reached with the Congressional leadership restores
       significant benefit cuts for legal immigrants and makes the food stamp changes much
       fairer.

Service
       I am very pleased that we have spurred a new effort to reach out to children at risk
        thought the Presidents' Summit on America's Future, with the participation of all the
       living fonner Presidents or their representative, and the critical involvement of Gen.
       Colin Powell. The summit focused the nation's attention on citizen service and
        voluntarism aimed at reaching an additional 2 million children at risk by the year 2000.
        General Powell is leading the effort to reach this goal -- to give these 2 million children a

through a good education, and an opportunity to give back to their communities.
