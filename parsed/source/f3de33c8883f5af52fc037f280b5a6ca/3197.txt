Today, President Clinton unveils a tax cut proposal. It is a fair proposal that places a priority on education
tax cuts and provides a child tax credit to families who work hard and pay taxes. The proposal incorporates
Republican priorities in a good faith effort to honor the budget accord and to reach final agreement on a tax
cut the American people deserve.

                   A 2-year modified $1,500 HOPE Scholarship to make two years of college universally availal
                          20% tuition credit to make the third and fourth years of college more affordable and I
                          promote lifelong learning.
                   A $500 child tax credit for tax-paying working families with children under 17 through 2002
                          under 19 thereafter. Families could put the credit plus $500 in a Kidsave Account.
                   Two-thirds of the President's tax cut goes to the middle 60 percent offamilies -- twice as larg.
                          as the congressional alternatives provide these middle-income families.
                   To honor the agreement, the President's plan allows taxpayers to exclude 30% of their long-t.
                          capital gains from taxation and provides estate tax relief to small businesses and farn
                   Includes no tax time bombs that would explode in cost.

                                         A Fact Sheet

EDUCATION TAX CUTS
   Two-year HOPE Scholarship. A maximum $1,500 credit beginning in 1998. Students attending on at least
    a half-time basis would receive a 100% credit for the first $1,000 of tuition and required fees for enrollment
    in a post-secondary degree or certificate program and a 50% credit for up to the next $1,000. For example, a
    student attending a community college with tuition costs of $1 ,400 would receive a $1,200 HOPE
    Scholarship. Scholarships would be phased out for joint filers earning between $80,000 and $100,000.
    Eligible students could receive both a full Pell Grant and a HOPE Scholarship. The previously proposed B-
    rule has been dropped. After 2002, the HOPE Scholarship increases to a 100% credit for the first $1,500 and
    a 50% credit for the next $1,000 of tuition and required fees.

   20% Tuition Tax Credit. Third and fourth year students, graduate students, plus working people going to
    school to improve their education and skills, would benefit from a 20% tax credit on the first $5,000 of
    tuition and required fees through the year 2000 and after 2000 a 20% tax credit on the first $10,000 of tuition
    and required fees. The credit would be phased out for joint filers earning between $80,000 and $100,000.

   Education and Retirement Savings Accounts. Allows penalty-free IRA withdrawals for undergraduate,
    post-secondary vocational, and graduate education expense and the first-time purchase of a home.
    Additionally, taxpayers are given the opportunity to contribute their child tax credit plus an additional $500,
    up to $1,000, to a Kidsave Account for the child's education, first-time home purchase or the taxpayer's
    retirement. Earnings would accumulate tax-free in the Kidsave Account and no taxes would be due upon
    withdrawal for an approved purpose.

   Tax Incentives/or School Construction. Provides tax credits to finance constructioll and/or rehabilitation
    of elementary or secondary schools in distressed communities. States would be able to allocate a fixed
    amount of tax credits (based on population) to public schools to help pay for construction or renovation
    projects. The allocation would be for projects in schools that are in empowerment zones or enterprise
    communities, or that have a high percentage of low-income students. This program would function
    similarly to the current low-income housing tax credit program.

   Employer-Provided Education Benefits. Extends permanently Section 127 of the tax code, which allows
    people to exclude $5,250 of employer provided education benefits from their taxable income. Both
    undergraduate and graduate education would be eligible. Additionally, a 10% employer credit for small
    business training is included. This credit would apply to payments made to third parties to cover expenses of
    education for employees under employer-provided education assistance programs. The credit would be
    available to employers with average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less for the prior three years.

   Student Loan Interest Deduction and Forgiveness. Allows a deduction of up to $2,500 per year of interest
    on education loans for expenses of students enrolled at least half-time at an institution of higher education.
    The deduction would be allowed for the first 60 months interest is due on a loan. The deduction would phase
    out for taxpayers making between $45,000 and $65,000 ($65,000 and $85,000 for married taxpayers filing
    jointly). This deduction would be available even if the taxpayer does not itemize deductions.
    To encourage people to use their education and training in community service, the income exclusion for
    student loan forgiveness would be expanded to include loan forgiveness extended by nonprofit tax-exempt
    charitable or educational institutions, and to loans forgiven under the Direct Loan Program's
    income-contingent repayment program. Currently, the exclusion generally covers only contingent
    forgiveness arrangements between students and government entities.

   Incentives/or K-I2 Computer Donations. Provides tax incentives for private sector donations of computer
    equipment to schools. The proposal would work in combination with the Telecommunications Act of 1996
    to ensure that public schools have access to modern computer technology.

   Repeal Cap on Tax Exempt Bond Issuance by Colleges and Universities. Repeals the $150 million bond
    cap that affects private higher education institutions and certain other charitable institutions. The repeal
    would apply to tax-exempt bonds issued by these institutions to finance new capital expenditures.
CHILD TAX CREDIT

       Age. Covers children under 17 through 2002 and under 19 thereafter.
       Amount per child. $400 in 1998, $500 in 1999 and then indexed.
       Income Limits. Phased out for families making $60,000 to $75,000 until 2000, and then $80,000 to
        $100,000 thereafter.                                       .
       Refundability to Cover Out-of-Pocket Income and Payroll Taxes. Working families who payout of
        pocket federal taxes would benefit from the child tax credit. Child tax credit is calculated before the EITC
        and will be partially refundable. A family will get a child credit for their income taxes plus the extent to
        which their out-of-pocket (employee share) payroll taxes exceed their EITC.
       Savings Incentive Feature. As described above, taxpayers who are entitled to a child credit would be
        given the opportunity to contribute their child tax credit plus an additional $500 each year to a Kidsave
        Account for the child's education, first time home purchase or the taxpayer's retirement. Earnings
        would accumulate tax-free in the account and no taxes would be due upon withdrawal for an approved
        purpose.


URBAN REVITALIZATION
   Incentives to Clean Up and Redevelop Contaminated Sites (Brownfields). Certain environmental
    remediation costs would be provided tax favorable treatment, allowing them to be fully deducted
    immediately, to spur clean-up and redevelopment of contaminated sites in high poverty areas. To qualify
    for this tax incentive, sites would have to satisfy use, geographic, and contamination requirements.

   Expand Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. The proposal has the three main components
    that were in the President's budget. First, within 180 days of enactment, two additional urban empowerment
    zones would be authorized and would benefit from current tax incentives. Second, technical changes would
    be made to allow a broader range of businesses in EZs and ECs to borrow the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds.
    Third, the proposal authorizes the additional designation of 20 (15 urban and 5 rural) Empowerment Zones
    and 80 (50 urban and 30 rural) Enterprise Communities. The newly designated zones would have different
    available tax incentives than existing zones. The current law wage credit would not be available. The
    brownfields incentives would be available as would special expensing of business assets and qualification for
    private-activity bonds.
   Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Up to $100 million in tax credits would be made
    available to the CDFI Fund to allocate for equity investors in community development financial institutions to
    leverage private investment in distressed areas and to stimulate economic revitalization.

   Washington, D.C. Provides tax incentives for firms to hire District residents, and a new credit that will be
    allocated to debt and equity by a new economic development corporation, and to allow the issuance of
    additional tax-exempt debt to help finance new business activity in the District.


WELFARE-TO-WORK TAX CREDIT
As proposed in the President's budget, to help move people from welfare to work, a new 50% tax credit would be
made available on the first $10,000 in annual wages of certain long-term family assistance recipients for two
years of employment.


SMALL BUSINESS TAX CUTS:
Home office deduction
The existing home office deduction would be broadened to cover small businesses where: (1) the office is
exclusively used to conduct substantial and essential administrative or management activities on a regular
basis; and (2) the taxpayer has no other location to conduct these essential administrative or management
activities.
Increases the existing exclusion for equity investments in small businesses held at least five years to a 75%
exclusion for up to $20 million in gains and doubles the eligibility limits on firm size from $50 million to
$100 million.


PRESIDENT'S HOME SALES TAX CUT
Provides a $500,000 exclusion for capital gains on home sales for couples, providing tax relief and greatly
simplifYing record-keeping and compliance. The exclusion for single filers would be $250,000.


30% EXCLUSION FOR CAPITAL GAINS
Taxpayers would be allowed to exclude 30% of their long-term capital gains from taxation. Long-term capital
gains will be defined, as under current law, as assets held for more than one year. For example, a family in the
28% income tax bracket would face a capital gains tax rate of 19.6 percent:


ESTATE TAXES
A special exclusion is added for qualified family-owned businesses and farms. Currently, for married couples,
only estates valued above $1.2 million pay any estate taxes. A special exclusion of $900,000 would be added to
ensure that the first $2.1 a million of family-owned business or farm would not be subject to estate taxes. This is
a proposal advanced by Senator Daschle.


OTHER PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVES

   Puerto Rico Tax Credit - would be extended indefinitely and modified to provide an incentive for new
    investments and increase the economic-activity credit.

   FSC Software - would extend the foreign sales corporation benefit, exempting a portion of income for tax
    purposes, to include computer software licensed for reproduction abroad.

   Equitable Tolling - would extend time people are allowed to claim a tax refund to include time that they are
    medically determined to be mentally or physically impaired.


EXTENSIONS OF EXPIRING PROVISIONS
The R&E tax credit would be extended through the end of 1998. Contributions of appreciated stock to private
foundations, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (including new targeted group), and the orphan drug credit would
be extended for one year.


TOBACCO TAXES
The proposal includes a 20 cent increase in tobacco taxes that would be separated into a trust fund and dedicated
entirely to expanding health coverage for children, addressing other children's development issues, and
improving the overall public health.

Example #1

Consider a family of four who makes $40,000 a year. The father is a carpenter and makes $25,000 and the
mother makes $15,000 working at a local department store. They have two kids, a son who is 14 and a
freshman in high school and a daughter enrolled full-time in her first year at the local community college. Her
tuition is $1,200 a year.
The President's tax cut proposal will benefit this family in at least two ways. They will receive a child tax credit
of $500 for their son plus a HOPE Scholarship of $1,100 for their daughter. In total, they will receive a $1,600
tax cut in the President's proposal.

Example #2
Consider a family of three making $55,000 a year. The father has a degree in accounting and works for a local
business in the accounting department. The mother works part-time at the local library. They have one
daughter aged 14. The father would like to return to school to prepare for his CPA examination. He is going to
attend the local liberal arts college. He has signed up for two courses with total tuition of$4,000.
This family will receive a $500 tax child tax credit for their daughter and a $800 tuition tax credit to help pay for
the father's course work.

A single mother lives with her six year old daughter in California. She's been working as a bank teller for
several years and her pay is now $20,000 a year. When she tallies up her taxes, she owes $1,200 in federal
income taxes. A $1,150 Earned Income Tax Credit offsets much of this income tax. However, she pays $1,530
a year in payroll taxes, not to mention the additional $1,530 the bank pays on her behalf.
Under the President's plan this single mom would receive a $500 child tax credit for her daughter.    (Note: This
woman and her daughter would receive no tax cut under either the House or Senate plans).

                          TO AMERICA'S WORKING FAMILIES

Compared to the President's proposal, four million working families will largely be denied a child tax credit
under the congressional tax plans. The President strongly believes that families who work hard, play by the rules
and make approximately $18,000 or $28,000, who pay taxes, and who are trying to do the best for their kids just
like everybody else, deserve a tax cut too.
This is an issue that is susceptible to both eye-glazing technical jargon, talk of "stacking," and misleading
rhetoric: "It's welfare." Setting aside the jargon and the rhetoric, this is an issue best weighed by looking at real
people:


Example -- Family of Four with Two Children
Consider a family offour with two children living in a medium sized southern city. The father is a rookie police
officer making $23,000, and the mother is taking afew years offfrom working. This fam ily pays federal taxes
well above the amount of EITC they receive:

                         Greater Benefits for More Families

While providing the greatest help in the first two years, the President's plan has always gone much further,
granting a substantial tax cut for any investment in postsecondary education or training. Unlike the
Congressional plans, the Administration's higher education tax cut covers all types and ages of students,
including:

              part-time students;

              students beyond their first two years of undergraduate study;
              graduate students;

              workers who are improving job skills rather than seeking a degree;
              those not fortunate enough to have been able to put a lot of money into savings.
For many situations that families find themselves in, the plans passed by the Senate and the House provide little
or no help. Consider the following common situations:

President Clinton's tax cut proposal provides needed tax relief to working families who play by the rules, pay
taxes, and are trying to do the best for their kids. It includes a major investment in the President's top priority --
education.- by making the first two years of college universally available and doing something the other plans do
not: helping those Americans who are working and want to improve their education and upgrade their skills.
Lastly, President Clinton's proposal incorporates Republican priorities in a good faith effort to honor the budget
accord and to reach final agreement for a tax cut the American people deserve.

THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL IS FAIR. The bulk of the President's tax cut goes to middle-class families 렁
two-thirds ofthe President's tax cut goes to the middle sixty percent of families, twice the share the alternative
congressional plans provide these middle class families.

THE PRESIDENT PLACES A HIGHER PRIORITY ON EDUCATION TAX CUTS. Education must be
America's highest priority and the core of our tax cut plan must help families pay for education. To offer opportunity in
the new and rapidly changing economy, we must make the 13th and 14th years of education -- the first two years of
college -- as universal as a high school diploma is today. We must also do what we can to help people throughout their
lives improve their education and upgrade their skills throughout their lives. The President's plan:

./ ADVANCES THE GOAL OF MAKING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE UNIVERSAL.
   The plan includes a modified two-year $1,500 HOPE Scholarship that does more to help community college students
   than the congressional alternatives. First and second year students would receive a $1,000 credit for the first $1,000
   oftuition and fees plus 50% of as much as another $1,000 in tuition and fees. Therefore, a student going to a
   typical community college with tuition of $1 ,200 would receive a $1, I 00 credit under the President's proposal,
   compared to just $600 and $900 under the House and Senate plans respectively .

./ HELPS THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR STUDENTS AND PROMOTES LIFELONG LEARNING.
   The congressional plans give virtually no support to families who are struggling to pay college costs out of
   pocket. Students beyond the second year would benefit only if they had substantial savings or when they
   paid interest on student loans. Students over 30렁 one-fourth of all undergraduate students -- could not even
   make use ofthe education savings accounts that Congress is proposing. At a time when older workers need
   to improve their education and upgrade their skills, it is critical that the education tax cuts promote lifelong
   learning. The President's proposal accomplishes this goal: It provides a 20 percent tuition credit on
   expenses up to $5,000 initially and $10,000 beginning in 2001.

./ INCORPORATES OTHER GOOD EDUCATION IDEAS INCLUDED IN VARIOUS PROPOSALS,
   such as a permanent extension of the tax preference for employer-provided undergraduate and graduate education,
   tax incentives for school construction, a student loan interest deduction, and tax exclusion for community service
   and income-contingent loan forgiveness.

THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT FAMILIES WHO WORK HARD, PAY TAXES, AND TRY TO DO
THE BEST FOR THEIR KIDS DESERVE A TAX CUT. HIS PLAN CUTS THE TAXES OF THE 4
MILLION FAMILIES SHORTCHANGED BY CONGRESS. The President's proposal includes a $500 child
tax credit for children under 17 through 2002 and under 19 thereafter. The President has a basic disagreement with
 some members of Congress. Consider a family offour with two small children: the father is a rookie police officer
making $23,000, and the mother is taking afow years offfrom teaching. They payout ofpocket over $1,000 a year in
federal taxes. The President believes that this family needs and deserves a tax cut just as much as family who makes
twice as much. The Congressional plans would deny this family a tax cut. Under the President's plan, this family would
receive a $767 child tax credit.

TAX INCENTIVES TO CLEAN-UP AND REVITALIZE DISTRESSED NEIGHBORHOODS BELONG
IN THE FINAL T AX PACKAGE. In the balanced budget agreement, President Clinton and Congress agreed to
make all efforts to include three programs critical to our urban areas in the final budget package: a Brownfields tax
incentive; new Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities (EZIEC); and expansion of the Community
Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) fund. Unfortunately, neither the House tax bill nor the Senate tax bill
includes the President's Brownfields and EZ/EC initiatives. Today, the President includes these two vital
provisions, plus a new tax credit to encourage investment in CDFIs and an enhanced welfare-to-work tax credit, in
his tax cut proposal.

proposal.

PRESIDENT CLINTON'S TAX PLAN HELPS TO CLEAN UP AND REDEVELOP BROWNFIELDS.
The Brownfields tax incentive included in the President's tax cut proposal would reduce the cost of cleaning up
thousands of contaminated, abandoned sites in economically distressed areas by permitting clean-up costs to be
immediately deducted for tax purposes, rather than requiring this spending to be written off over time. This
would, in tum, encourage redevelopment of these areas. The Treasury Department estimates this $2 billion tax
incentive will, over seven years, leverage more than $10 billion for private sector cleanups nationwide, allowing
redevelopment of 30,000 brownjields.

      Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, writing on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors,.urged Ways and
       Means Chairman Archer to include the President's Brownfields proposal in the tax bill: "This is a high
       priority for communities across this nation and we stand united in urging you and other members of the
       House Ways and Means Committee to modify the tax bill to include the $2 billion brownfields tax
       incentive. "

THE PRESIDENT'S TAX PLAN CREATES NEW EMPOWERMENT ZONES AND ENTERPRISE
COMMUNITIES. Under the President's 1993 Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Community initiative,
communities develop a strategic plan to spur economic development, and they receive Federal tax benefits, social
service grants and flexibility in use of Federal funds in order to put this plan in effect. The EZs and ECs are
urban or rural areas with high poverty and unemployment rates.

       Many communities that were not designated as EZs or ECs in that jirst round lack the seed capital to
       begin revitalization efforts. In response, the President proposes a second-round of EZs and ECs--J5
       urban and 5 rural EZs and 50 urban and 30 rural ECs. The new EZs and ECs will benefit from a
       slightly different blend of tax credits than the first-round communities.

THE PRESIDENT'S TAX PLAN ALSO PROVIDES FOR A NEW COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TAX CREDIT. The President's CDFI Fund is helping to build a national
network of community development financial institutions -- including banks, thrifts, and credit unions -- by
providing financial and technical assistance to these entities. CDFI dollars are being used to create jobs, rebuild
neighborhoods and restore hope in communities from San Francisco to Boston, Louisville to Chicago. The
Fund represents a promising model for Federal government action -- investing in local private sector institutions,
leveraging private sector resources (to the tune often times the initial investment) and generating economic
growth in distressed areas. The President's tax cut proposal creates a new tax credit to encourage investment in
CDFls. This new credit is not included in either the House or Senate versions of the tax legislation.

THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN INCLUDES A SPECIAL WELFARE-TO-WORK TAX CREDIT. This
credit gives employers added incentive to hire welfare recipients. Although the congressional leadership
pledged to seek a credit along these lines, the House bill includes only a scaled-back version, and the Senate bill
omits it entirely.
