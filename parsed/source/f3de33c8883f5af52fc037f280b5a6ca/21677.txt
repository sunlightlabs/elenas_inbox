Today, President Clinton will sign two bills to: (1) honor law enforcement killed in the line of
duty by providing college scholarships to their families; and (2) strengthen penalties for violent
criminals and drug traffickers who possess, brandish, or discharge a gun when committing a
cnme.

Honoring Our Police

      College scholarships for the families of slain officers. On October 3, 1996, President
       Clinton signed into law the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act
       (FLEDA). The law provides higher education benefits for the spouses and children of
       Federal law enforcement officers killed or disabled in the line of duty. Last fall, 11
       young men and women were able to go to attend college as a result of the Act.

      Expanding assistance to more families. Last year, President Clinton called on
       Congress to pass legislation to provide similar educational assistance to the families of
       state and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. Today, President
       Clinton will sign the Police, Fire, and Emergency Officers Educational Assistance Act of
       1998, which expands FLEDA to provide college scholarships to the dependents of all             .
       public safety officers slain or incapacitated in the line of duty. In addition to the families
       of slain state and local law enforcement officers, this new law will benefit the families of
       firefighters, correctional officers, and rescue and ambulance squad members.

Enforcing Tougher Punishments.

      Applying the law to more gun-carrying criminals. The President will also sign S.
       191, a bill that clarifies and strengthens the federal penalties that apply to violent
       criminals and drug felons who commit crimes while carrying a gun. Until recently,
       the U.S. Supreme Court had applied a restrictive interpretation of what constituted
       "use" of a firearm during the commission of a federal crime -- allowing, for
       example, drug traffickers with guns in their car trunks to avoid the 5-year
       mandatory minimum sentences intended by Congress. This new law makes clear
       that violent criminals and drug felons who simply possess a firearm during the
       commission of a federal crime are subject to an additional -- and mandatory --
       sentence of 5 years.

      Increasing penalties. S. 191 also increases the stiff, mandatory penalties that apply
       to criminals who actually use firearms during the commission of certain federal
       crimes. Specifically, this new law provides that -- in addition to the penalties that
       apply for underlying violent or drug crimes --criminals receive a mandatory
       minimum sentence of at least 7 years for brandishing a firearm and of at least 10
       years if the firearm is discharged. The bill also increases the penalty for
       subsequent convictions for these offenses from 20 years to 25 years.

                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
    Survivors Act to guarantee a minimum level of funds to maintain and enhance counseling
    programs that assist the families of public safety officers who die in the line of duty.
