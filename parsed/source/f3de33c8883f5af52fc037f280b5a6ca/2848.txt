                         CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SYMPOSIUM ON
                              YOUTH VIOLENCE AND CRIME
                                      June 11, 1997

         Announcement
             Today, President Clinton announced he will act to further restrict youth access to guns by
              directing the Treasury Department to use its existing authority to regulate
              federally-licensed gun dealers (FFLs).to publish regulations requiring them to post signs
              and issue written notifications warning handgun purchasers about prohibitions on
              transferring guns to minors and juvenile handgun possession [and that handguns are a
              leading contributor to juvenile violence and fatalities].

         Background
              The mix of kids and guns is at the heart of our nation's youth violence epidemic. Guns
               -- and handguns in particular -- have fueled the surge in juvenile murders. Since 1984,
               the number of juveniles killing with a gun has quadrupled. And teenage boys today are
               more likely to die of gun shot wounds than all natural causes combined.

               The Administration's juvenile crime legislation gets tough on guns by: increasing
                penalties for illegally transferring guns to juveniles; expanding the Brady Law to prohibit
                violent juveniles from owning guns as adults; and requiring federal gun dealers to provide
                child safety locks with every gun sold.

               The President believes there is more we can-- and should -- do to cut off the easy access
                to guns for our kids. For almost every gun that gets into a juvenile's hands, an adult had
                an opportunity to stop that transfer from taking place.

               The President's directive ensures that Treasury will do everything in its power to put
                adult gun purchasers on notice about their legal obligation to help keep handguns away
                from our kids. The directive calls for Treasury to issue regulations requiring all FFLs to
                post signs and issue written warnings with each handgun sold that:

                        (1)    Make clear that it is generally illegal for any adult to transfer a handgun to
                               a minor, or for minors to possess a handgun;
                        (2)    Make clear that violation of the prohibition on transferring a handgun to a
                               juvenile is punishable, in some circumstances, by up to 10 years in prison;
                        [(3)   Warn that handguns are a leading contributor to juvenile violence and
                               fatalities;] and
                        (4)    Suggest that safely storing and locking handguns can help ensure
                               compliance with this law.

         Clinton Administration's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy
               The President's strategy seeks to break the back of violent gangs, reduce youth violence,
                and provide kids with alternatives to steer them away from gangs, guns and drugs. In
                addition to getting tough on guns, his strategy includes $200 million for local prosecutors,
                probation officers, and anti-gang task forces and funds after school programs to keep kids
                off the streets and out of trouble.
