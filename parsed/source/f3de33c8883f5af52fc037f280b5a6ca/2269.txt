                President Clinton Announces XX Companies Have Accepted his Welfare to Work Challenge;
                             Pledges Transportation, Supports to Help Welfare Reform Succeed
                                       May 20, 1997 -- 5/16/97 1:00 PM DRAFT

     Announcements
             Today, President Clinton announced that XX companies have accepted his welfare to work challenge
     and launched the "new national effort" he called for in his State of the Union address "to marshal America's
     businesses, large and small, to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work." The President
     pledged his commitment to ensure that those leaving welfare have the help they need to succeed in the
     workplace, such as transportation, child care, and mentoring. He also announced new numbers showing
     welfare caseloads have decline XX months in a row, for a total of XX percent from January 1993 to February
     1997.    At today's White House ceremony:

           XX companies pledged to hire and retain welfare recipients without displacing other workers and
            launched The Welfare to Work Partnership, a private, non-profit organization which will lead the
            national business effort to hire people from the welfare rolls. United Airlines CEO Gerald
            Greenwald was named chairman of the board.

           President Clinton announced transportation seed grants to 24 states to begin efforts to ensure welfare
            recipients can get to jobs, and he urged Congress to enact his NEXTEA transportation bill, which
            provides $600 million in welfare to work transportation funds.

           Vice President Gore announced he will begin a campaign, beginning with a conference on May 29th,
            to enlist civic groups to mentor welfare recipients to help them retain jobs and succeed in the
            workplace.

            The President was joined today by [list speakers].

     The Welfare to Work Partnership
             The Welfare to Work Partnership launched today is an independent, nonpartisan, national effort of
     the American business community to help move those on public assistance into jobs in the private sector.
     The Partnership will provide information, technical assistance, and support for businesses of all sizes, from all
     industries and all regions of the country. The Partnership was formed in response to the President's
     challenge to business leaders in his 1997 State of the Union. Its founding board members are the CEOs of
     the five companies -- Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United Airlines -- the President praised in
     the State of the Union. The Partnership's President and CEO is Eli J. Segal, a successful entreprenuer who
     recently completed a term as CEO of the Corporation for National Service.

     The President's Welfare to Work Transportation Initiative
             One of the biggest barriers faced by people moving from welfare to work is finding transportation.
     Nationally, less than 6 percent of welfare recipients own cars and nearly two-thirds of new jobs are in
     suburbs, which are often difficult to reach via public transportation. The President has proposed a six-year,
     $600 million grant program as part of his NEXTEA transportation bill that would support flexible,
     innovative transportation systems in rural, urban, and suburban areas to get people where the jobs are.
     These funds could be used to create new services (such as van pools from residential centers to industrial
     parks) or to supplement or extend existing transit services (such as adding bus routes). Today, the President

announced grants to 24 states and one territory to develop coordinated transportation plans to support
welfare reform efforts. The grants are being awarded by the Department of Transportation's Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Highway Administration in cooperation with the National Governors'
Association.
                                   President Clinton's Welfare to Work Record

Working with the Private Sector
When President Clinton signed welfare reform into law in last August, he said:

        Now that we are saying with this bill we expect work, we have to make sure the people have
        a chance to go to work. If we really value work, everybody in this society -- businesses,
        non-profirs, religious insdtudons, individuals, those in government -- all will have a
        responsIbility to make sure the jobs are there.

Since making that statement in August, the President has launched an aggressive campaign to challenge both
the public and private sector to help welfare reform succeed. The President signalled his commitment to
work with the corporate community by holding a meeting in the Oval Office with 14 company CEOs shortly
after being inaugurated to his second term. Mter that meeting five companies committed to lead a national
welfare to work effort. These companies, who today form the founding board of directors for The Welfare
to Work Partnership, were highlighted in the President's 1997 State of the Union address in February:

        I'd like to say to every employer in our country who ever cridcized the old welfare system:
        you can't blame that old system anymore; we have torn it down. Now do your part. Give
        someone on welfare the chance to go to work. Tonight, I am pleased to announce that five
        major corporadons -- Sprint, Monsanto, UPs, Burger King, and United Airlines -- will be the
         first to join in a new national effort to marshal America's businesses, large and small, to create
        jobs so that people can move from welfare to work.

      Since February, the number of companies accepting the President's challenge has grown from five to
xx. Private sector commitments like these will be needed to ensure the welfare caseloads, which have fallen
xx percent since President Clinton took office, continue to decline.
Welfare to Work Policy Intiatives
       In addition to working with the private sector, the President's efforts to promote successful welfare
reform have included:

       Tools to Move People from Welfare to Work.       The President fought for and won in the budget
        agreement two critical welfare to work initiatives. The first is a $3 billion Welfare to Work
        Challenge fund for cities and states to create jobs and provide incentives for employment.
        Complementing this initiative is the President's proposed enhanced Work Opportunity Tax Credit.
        The proposal would
        1) provide an enhanced benefit for companies that hire long-term welfare recipients, allowing a 50
        tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid over two years; and 2) make a tax credit available for a
        new group, those 18- to 50-year-olds no longer eligible for food stamps under the new welfare rules.

     Supporting Welfare Recipients in the Work Force. President Clinton has committed himself to
      ensuring that critical supports, such as child care and transportation, are available to those who leave
      welfare for work. The President fought for child care funding during the welfare reform debate, and
      the bill he signed into law contained $14 billion in child care funds, $4 billion more than prior law.
      This year, he has proposed $600 million in flexible transportation funds to support innovative
      efforts to help welfare recipients travel from where they live to where the jobs are. Today, Vice
      President Gore announced a new effort to enlist members of civic groups to mentor welfare recipients
      to help them succeed in the workplace.

      The Federal Government's Fair Share.     The President has committed the federal government to do its
       fair share to hire people from the welfare rolls and appointed Vice President Gore to head up the
       effort. On April 10th the President held the first full Cabinet meeting of his second term in which
       federal agencies pledged to directly hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients over the next four years.

The Four Year Record
     Welfare caseloads have declined by   xx percent or XX million since President Clinton took office --
      the largest decline in 50 years.

      The President's successful economic policies, which created 12 million new jobs during his first four
       years in office, greatly contributed to this decline.

      Another major factor in the caseload declines was the waivers President Clinton granted to 43 states to
     . allow them to impose tough work requirements and make work pay better than welfare. A recent
       Council of Economic Advisers analysis found that 31 percent of the caseload decline can be attributed
       to waiver policies and 44 percent to economic growth.

      Not only have welfare caseloads gone down under President Clinton, but child support collections
       have gone up. During the last four years, the Administration's child support enforcement crackdown
       helped increase collections by 50 , from $8 billion in 1992 to a record $12 billion in 1996.
