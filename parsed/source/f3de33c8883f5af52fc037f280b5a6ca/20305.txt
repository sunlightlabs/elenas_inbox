Child Care

Q_       What is your child care initiative?

A.       The President's billanced budget proposal includes over $20 billion over five years
         for child care, the largest single investment in child care in the nation's history.
         This initiative responds to the struggles our nation's working parents face in finding
         child care that they can afford, trust, and rely on. The President's proposal will
         help working families pay for child care, build the supply of good after-school
         programs, improve the safety and quality of care, and promote early learning..
        Doubles the number of children receiving child care subsidies to more than two
         million by the year 2003 by increasing funding for the Child Care and
         Development Block Grant by $7.5 billion over 5 years.
        Increases tax credits for three million working families to help them pay for
         child care by investing $5.1 billion over 5 years in the Child and Dependent Tax
         Credit. The President's proposal also provides a new tax credit for businesses
         that offer child care services for their employees.
        Provides after-school care for 500,000 children per year by expanding the 21st
         Century Community Learning Center program by $800 million over 5 years to
         provide funds to school-community partnerships to establish or expand
         programs for school-age children.
        Improves child care safety and quality and enhances early childhood
         development by establishing a new Early Learning Fund as well as supporting
         enforcement of state child care health and safety standards, providing
         scholarships to up to 50,000 child care providers per year, and investing in
         research and consumer education.

    Q.   The Kerry-Bond amendment targeted funds from the tobacco legislation specifically to
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
      child care. Will you support this proposaJ in the House if the tobacco bill makes it out
      of the Senate?

A.    The P~esident believes that some funds from tobacco legislation should be spent on
      child care. We were pleased that we were able to reach agreement with Senator
      McCain before he brought the bill to the floor to add important language to the bill's
      spending provisions to provide funding for child care. Under that agreement, if
      states spent their restricted funding in proportion to current expenditures, at least 40
      of the funds, or over $5 billion over 5 years, could have been spent on child care. We
      did not support the Kerry-Bond amendment because of that agreement. We will
      continue to work for adequate child care funding in the House.

      [The McCain bill provides that 40 percent of funds received will go to the states,
      totaling $196.5 billion over 25 years. Half of these state funds must be used for
      designated programs to enhance the health and well-being of children and families
      most in need, including child care. Kerry-Bond would earmark half of these
      restricted funds f()r child care.]

21st Century Community Learning Centers Program

Q.    What is the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program?

A.    The 21st Century Community Learning Centers program supports before- and
      after-school, weekend, and summer programs in rural and inner-city schools, giving
      children a safe, drug-free and supervised environment.

      Today, the President is announcing nearly $40 million in grants to support over 300
      centers in 98 communities and 36 states that will serve roughly 35,000 children. The
      President has requested $200 million for this program in 1999 and $1 billion over five
      years, which will support nearly 4,000 centers (through grants to approximately 1,000
      communities) serVing a total of a half-million children each year. In expanding the
      current program, the President's proposal requires a local match to leverage $2 billion
      nationally for after-school programs over five years; better targets funds to
      high-need communities; requires that schools work closely with community
      organizations in establishing these programs; and reserves up to 10 percent of
      the funds available for community-based organizations working collaboratively
      with public schools.

Q.    Is there really a need for new investment?

A.    There is a huge, and largely unmet, demand for quality after-school programs
      that can help children learn and develop in a safe, supervised location. Today,
      roughly 28 million school-age children have both parents or their only parent in the
      workforce.[BLS, 6/98] At least 5 million latchkey children -- and possibly as many as
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
       15 million -- are left unsupervised each week. Research indicates that during these
       unsupervised. hours children are more likely to engage in at-risk behavior, such as
       crime, drugs, and alcohol use. In fact, statistics show that most juvenile crime takes
       place between the hours of 2 p.m. and 8 p.m, and that children are also at much greater
       risk of being the victims of crime during the hours after school. But despite the need
       and the strong public support, the majority of the nation's public schools do not
       offer after-school programs, often because of a lack of resources. Among
       seventh and eighth graders, less than 1 percent were enrolled in after-school
       programs.

Q.    What are the prospects on the Hill for the President's proposed expansion of the
      21st Century Community Learning Centers Program?

A.    Despite the tight budget caps in both the House and the Senate, there is a great deal of
      bipartisan support for expanding the 21 st Century Community Learning program.
      Senator Jeffords, who sponsored the legislation that established this program and has
      been a real leader in working fo expand it. In the House, a number of Republicans
      support increased appropriations for the program, as indicated by a letter to
      Appropriations Committee Chair Bob Livingston (R-LA), which was signed by over
      60 Members from both sides of the aisle.

Q.    Who are receiving grants and how were they chosen?

A.    Ninety-eight communities are today receiving nearly $40 million in grants to
      establish 21st Century Community Learning Center after-school programs.
      These three-year grants will support 315 school-based centers in 36 states that
      will serve roughly 35,000 children. The grants range in size from $47,600 (for
      one rural center) to $2,279,838 (for 12 urban centers) per year.

      This was one of the most highly competitive programs ever managed by the U.S.
      Department of Education. The Department received nearly 2,000 applications,
      participated in regional workshops attended by over 5,000 educators and
      community organization representatives, and responded to nearly 20,000
      inquiries about the competition. Applications were received from every state, the
      District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and several Pacific territories.
      The sites chosen were required to serve middle school children in rural or urban areas
      and wen~ evaluated based on their quality. The total amount of funding for
      after-school programs requested by the applicants was nearly $700 million per year.
      Unfortunately, only lout of 20 applicants could receive grants at the 1998 funding
      level.

Q.    What are the highlights of this report?

A.     The key finding of this report is that quality after-school programs can both
       decrease juvenile crime and improve children's academic performance. The report
       shows that after-school programs work -- many communities with after-school
       initiatives have lowered juvenile crime rates in surrounding neighborhoods. The
       report also shows that quality after-school programs improve the academic
       performance of children -- helping more children stay in school, increasing aspirations
       for college, and lowering the number of children who must be kept back. In addition,
       the report identifies key components of high-quality programs, and highlights
       model after-school initiatives in communities across the country. Safe and Smart
       will be sent to community-based organizations and to every school district in the
     . country in order to help them address the huge demand for after-school programs.
