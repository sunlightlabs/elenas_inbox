Enacting comprehensive tobacco legislation to reduce youth smoking dramatically is our most
urgent public health priority, and Senator McCain's leadership increases our chances of enacting
strong legislation this year. His bill provides a solid foundation for further action, but leaves
room for improvement. In particular, comprehensive tobacco legislation should include:

Strong Penalties for Missing Youth Smoking Targets -- Reducing Smoking is Our Bottom
Line; We Must Make it the Industry's Bottom Line

      The $3.5 billion cap on penalties significantly reduces the incentive for the tobacco
       industry to reduce youth smoking. Under the current plan, the tobacco industry would
       pay the same penalty for missing the youth smoking targets by 40% as it would for
       missing the targets by 20%. The cap should be eliminated or raised to a higher level, so
       that the tobacco industry has the strongest incentive to do everything in its power to stop
       hooking kids.

      Individual companies need to be held accountable for reducing youth smoking as well.
       In addition to strong industry-wide penalties, a separate company-by-company penalty
       scheme will help take the profit out of addicting teenagers.

National Environmental Tobacco Smoke Standards

      Progress toward other public health goals should include limiting exposure to
       environmental tobacco smoke in work sites and public places.

      We have serious concerns about this bill's provision which would allow individual States
       to "opt out" of the national smoke-free environment policy. This provision creates a
       patchwork system in which states could decide to adopt weaker laws or decide against
       taking any action at all, leaving people with little or no protection from the hazards of
       environmental tobacco smoke.

No Antitrust Exemption

      There is no need to exempt the tobacco industry from antitrust rules in order to reduce
       youth smoking. We strongly oppose any exemptions that would allow price fixing
       agreements.



                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                      '\utomated Records Management System
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

    Public Health Spending

    It is critical that any tobacco legislation include core public health investments, including funding
    for:

          National, state, community and school-based prevention and education efforts;

          Counter-advertising;

          Youth smoking data collection; and

          Research through the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the
           Centers for Disease Control, and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.

    Assistance for Children

    In addition to funding public health efforts, tobacco revenues should be targeted at efforts to
    assist children, including the President's proposals to:

          Double the number of working families who receive child care assistance;

          Reduce class size by hiring 100,000 additional teachers; and

          Fund Medicaid outreach efforts to ensure all children eligible for Medicaid health care
           coverage receive it.

    The President's Five Principles

    President Clinton has said he will only support tobacco legislation that:

           Raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over 5 years and $1.50 a pack over the
          . next ten years, and imposes tough penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids;

           Affirms the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;

           Gets companies out of the business of marketing and selling tobacco to minors;

           Promotes public health research and public health goals; and

           Protects our tobacco farmers and their communities.

    If we act now, we can reduce the number of youths smoking by 3 million between now and 2003
    -- and help us avoid approximately 1 million premature deaths.
