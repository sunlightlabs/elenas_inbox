TEXT:
The attached document contains talking points/factoids on our school
uniforms/curfews/truancy initiatives.  There still may not be enough
"there" there, but I think it compiles the high points of what we have
received so far from the agencies. We're still waiting on some additional
info from Great City Schools on school uniforms.

Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions or
suggestions.

Thanks,
Leanne

School Uniforms

     Spreading school uniform policies across the country.

      Recent push by schools to adopt unifOrm policies. Since President Clinton highlighted
      school uniforms in 1996, a large number of schools and school districts have adopted
      uniform policies to improve student discipline, attendance, and school climate.

             The Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics estimates
             that 34% of public schools with mandatory uniform policies initiated their policy
             in the 1996-97 school year.

             The 1998 NAESP survey of principals in 10 states shows that 11 % of elementary
             schools require uniforms, and 15% are considering a policy. Almost two-thirds
             of schools with policies adopted them in the last two years.

             In March 1998, the Education Commission of the States reported that 26 states
             have school uniform or dress code policies -- nearly double the number in 1996
             (14). These policies allow school districts to institute uniform or dress code
             policies.

      Many o(nation 's largest school districts moving first on unifOrms. Some of the nation's
      largest cities have adopted school uniform policies, including: New York City, Dade
      County, San Antonio, Houston, Chicago and Boston. In New York City alone, this will
      mean 560,000 elementary school students in the nation's largest school system will have
      school uniforms by fall of 1999.

     School uniforms are helping to improve school attendance and school safety in Long
      Beach, CA:

      School attendance hits all-time high. In the 1995-96 school year -- the third year school
      uniforms were required -- attendance at the Long Beach Unified School District K-8
      schools reached the highest point ever recorded during the 17 years the district compiled
      these statistics. With excused absences for illness added in, attendance exceeded 99%.

      School crime dramatically reduced. Between the 1993-94 school year (before uniforms
      were required) and the 1996-97 school year, total school crime plummeted 76%.
      Fighting dropped by 51 %; sex offenses declined by a stunning 93%; robbery/extortion
      decreased by 85%, chemical substances are down by 72%; and weapons offenses
      decreased by 83%.


Youth Curfews                                 Automated Records Management System
                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
      Curfews are designed to help keep children out ofhann's way, enhance community
      safety, and give parents an important tool to impart discipline, respect, and rules.

     A key part of a community effort to'keep our children safe. In May 1996, President
      Clinton released a Justice Department report on curfews which shows that curfews, when
      backed by a community of support and are part of a larger plan to help fight juvenile
      crime, can play an important role in keeping our children safe. The Justice report
      reviewed the impact of curfews in 7 selected jurisdictions (Dallas, Phoenix, Chicago,
      New Orleans, Denver, North Little Rock, and Jacksonville). Highlights include:

               The New Orleans program combines a curfew, a summer jobs program and the
               revitalization of recreation program -- and resulted in a 27% reduction in
               juvenile crime during curfew hours in 1994, compared with the previous year.

               The Dallas program allows for fines of both parents and children. Juvenile
               arrests during curfew hours decreased 14.6%.       '

               North Little Rock, provides sports activities and academic tutoring. Juvenile
               violent arrests during curfew hours decreased 12%.

               Denver's curfew program works in partnership with 234 different community
               programs. The law enforcement community believes it contributed significantly to
               the 11 % drop in serious crime during the program's first two years.

     Curfews are in effect in a majority of the Nation's largest cities. In a December 1997
      survey released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 276 -- 80% -- of347 cities surveyed
      had youth curfew laws, up from 70% in 1995. A 1998 update surveyed 18 cities with
      curfews in place for two years or less. The survey found:

      55% report a decrease in crime since curfew implementation, with an average 26.8%
      decrease in crime during enforcement hours.

      88% believe that curfews are a useful tool in curbing juvenile crime. Some of the
      reasons cities cited are that curfews: provide police with authority to remove juveniles
      from the streets, allow parents to set standards and police to monitor juvenile activity, and
      prevent youth from becoming perpetrators or victims of crime.

      72% of cities report no problems with implementation of the curfew, and 77% responded
      that there were no new costs associated with enforcing the curfew.



Anti-truancy                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                Hex텱wnp Conversion
    high rates of daytime burglary and vandalism. The Office of Juvenile Justice and
    Delinquency Prevention Study Group on Serious and Violent Juvenile Crime found that
    truancy is one of the major risk factors leading to serious and violent crime. The Justice
    Department's 1997 annual report on Drug Use Forecasting from the Arrestee Drug Abuse
    Monitoring Program reported that drug use is higher among detained male juveniles who
    were not in school, with higher rates of marijuana and cocaine use, as compared to
    juvenile males still in school.

   Anti-truancy efforts can have an impact on absenteeism, classroom-related
    incidents, and crime. In furtherance of the President's effort to focus national attention
    on anti-truancy measures, the Education Department provided several grants to local
    school districts to develop innovative truancy prevention programs in the 1996-97 school
    year. Highlights from the anti-truancy efforts include:

    Los Angeles Unified School District. The Truancy Prevention and Dropout Recovery
    Project is in effect in 24 schools in the district. During the first full year of the program,
    the attendance level jumped two full percentage points to 90.1, as compared to the
    1995-96 school year. This means that 400* more kids were in class -- and not
    unsupervised.

    Roanoke. VA. This program is a collaborative effort between the City Public Schools,
    City Department of Social Services, and Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.
    During the first year of the project, the number of students missing school for 25 or more
    days in the targeted schools decreased by an average of35%. During the second year,
    the number decreased by 28%.

    Philadelphia School District. The Weapons Reduction and Truancy Help (WRATH)
    initiative helped to increase school attendance by over two percentage points in the
    1997-98 school year. In addition, the number of students arrested for weapons offenses
    dropped by nearly 40% -- from 194 in 1995 to 119 in 1998.
