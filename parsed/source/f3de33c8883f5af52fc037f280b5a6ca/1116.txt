                          CLONING MEETING AND STATEMENT

                              DATE: March    4,1997
                              LOCATION:      Oval Office
                              TIME:          9:00 A.M.
                              FROM:          Tim Newell

I.    PURPOSE

      You will meet with Administration officials in the area of research and ethics to 1) issue a
      statement on cloning to assure the public that federal funds will not be used to clone humans;
      and (2) call on the scientific community to voluntarily refrain from human cloning until the
      ethical issues can be considered.

II.   BACKGROUND

      The recent announcement that Scottish researchers have successfully cloned an adult sheep
      has received widespread attention, since, hypothetically, similar techniques could be used to
      clone humans. Because of the ethical concerns human cloning would present, on February
      24 you asked your National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) to review the legal and
      ethical issues involved and to report back within 90 days on possible federal actions (see
      attached letter to Dr. Shapiro, NBAC Chair).

      Most scientists believe that human cloning faces major scientific barriers, and the majority of
      experts believe that any prospect of successfully applying this new cloning method to human
      beings in the near future is remote.

      Human cion ing research also faces federal funding barriers. On December 2, 1994, you issued
      a statement barring the use of federal funds to create human embryos for research purposes.
      Appropriations bills for FY96 and FY97 codified this policy and expanded it to cover HHS
      research in which human embryos are "destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk
      of injury or death greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero." (The
      Administration has opposed addressing the issue through legislation and has supported
      repealing this provision)

      There is some fear, however, that public concern over this issue could erode support for
      important genetic research programs, and/or result in overly-restrictive legislation. On
      February 26, testifying before the House Appropriations Subcom. on Labor, Health and
      Human Services, Dr. Varmus stated that while the idea of human cloning was "repugnant,"
      he "would be concerned about a rush to legislate" a prohibition since legislation could also
      restrict related work that offers important medical, economic, and scientific benefits.
      A consensus is emerging that researchers should not pursue the cloning of human beings at
      least until the nation has more thoroughly considered the ethical implications of the
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

       technology. The current restrictions do not assure this outcome for two reasons. .

       First, the current ban on using federal funds to create embryos for research does not explicitly
       prohibit all human cloning -- it only covers cloning of embryos that will be discarded (not
       implanted), and only covers HHS-funded research.

       Second, the restrictions apply to federally-supported human embryo research only, not
       privately-funded activities. Privately funded facilities are free to engage in human cloning
       research under current law. There is a booming business in all forms of reproduction
       technology to assist infertile couples. Human cloning is not likely to be pursued in this
       context -- at least until it has a chance of competing successfully against existing technology --
       but it cannot be definitively ruled out.

       Congress has scheduled fact-finding hearings on human cloning March 5 (Technology
       Subcommittee, House Science Committee) and March 12 (Senate Subcommittee on Science,
       Technology and Space). NIH Director Harold Varmus has been asked to testify at both
       upcoming hearings.

       Your statement at this time is intended to reassure the public; deter restrictive, ill-advised
       legislation; and strengthen the nation's resolve to consider ethical questions carefully before
       advancing human cloning by I) clarifying that federal dollars cannot be used for human
       cloning and that you are signing a memorandum to that effect; 2) calling on the scientific
       community to refrain from human cloning at least until NBAC and the nation have carefully
       considered the issue.

V.     SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

             At 9:00 AM, you will meet briefly in the Presidential Dining Room with the Vice
              President, Sec. Shalala, Dr. Varmus, Dr. Shapiro, Jack Gibbons, and Bruce Reed
              to discuss the Administration's response to the recent advances in cloning
              technology.

                     Dr. Varmus will brief the Vice President and you on the biomedical
                     implications of the new cloning technology.
                     Dr. Shapiro will discuss how NBAC will respond to your request for a
                     review of the ethical and legal implications related to cloning humans.

             At 9: lOAM, you will proceed into the Oval Office to the podium, accompanied
              by the Vice President, Sec. Shalala, Dr. Varmus, Dr. Shapiro, and Jack Gibbons.


             You will make a statement on cloning to the Press Pool.

             You will take questions from assembled press.

             You will depart the Oval Office.
