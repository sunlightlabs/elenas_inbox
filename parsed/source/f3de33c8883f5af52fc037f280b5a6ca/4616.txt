     Q&A for Presidential Initiative to Improve the Safety of Imported Fruits and Vegetables
                                         October 2, 1997


Q:     What is the President proposing?

A:     The President is proposing two legislative and [two] executive actions that will further
       improve the safety of fresh fruits and vegetables especially those imported into the U.S.
       First, the legislation will authorize the FDA to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, or other
       food from any foreign country whose food safety systems and standards are not on par
       with those of the U.S. Second, the President will also provide the necessary funds in his
       FY99 budget to enable FDA to expand dramatically its international inspection force so
       that it can make good use of this new authority, and to accelerate research to improve our
       knowledge of disease-causing pathogens on food.

       Third, the President has asked the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and
       Agriculture to take additional steps to improve the safety of both imported and domestic
       fruits and vegetables. Specifically, he has asked the Secretaries to issue within one year
       guidance on good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices for fruits and
       vegetables. [By providing the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and
       vegetables,] the guidance will improve the agricultural and manufacturing practices of all
       those, foreign and domestic, seeking to sell produce in the U.S. market.        .

       [Finally, the President has also asked the two Secretaries for a plan on how to improve the
       use of existing and projected resources to monitor agricultural and manufacturing
       practices abroad, assist foreign countries to improve those practices, and prevent the
       importation of unsafe produce, including by detecting unsafe food at the dock or border.
       The plan is due in 90 days.]

       These efforts all build on the Clinton Administration's long-term commitment to
       strengthening our food safety system. With the help of the Vice-President's National
       Performance Review, we have fundamentally improved the way we ensure the safety of
       meat, poultry, and seafood. We have also put in place important new protections against
       the risks of pesticides in our food, especially for our children. And we are hopeful
       Congress will provide the $43 million the President requested in his FY98 budget to
       improve food safety.


Q:     Why is he proposing these actions?

A:     There have been dramatic changes in the produce department of the gfocery store. Thirty
       years ago, most produce sections only had around a dozen items year round and that
       would increase to as many as 50 in the summer. Today, no matter where you live in the
       United States, the chances are there are 400 or more items in the produce section and they
       are there all year round. Last year, 38 percent of the fruit and 12 percent ofthe
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
     vegetables Americans ate were imported. [USDA is sending baseline data]

     We have changed as well. Americans are eating more fresh fruits and vegetables than
     ever before, and our nation's health experts tell us we will live longer, better quality lives
     as a result. Our environment is also changing. We are finding "new" exotic bugs such
     as cyc1ospora and E. coli 015 7:H7 on our food that once were not there.

     When you add up all these changes, and ask the question: is raw produce more risky to
     eat, the experts have told us they don't think so. The increase in the amount of produce
     and the types of produce we consume is far greater than the illnesses that may have
     resulted. But the experts have also made suggestions on ways to further improve the
     safety of raw produce, and the steps we are announcing today follow their advice.


Q:   Why has the Administration waited until now to take these steps?

A:   We are taking these steps now because they are the natural next steps in the President's
     long-term efforts to ensure the safety of the nation's food supply.

     One of the first challenges we faced after taking office in 1993 was an outbreak of E. coli
     in hamburger in the northwest. We recommended replacing our old system of
     responding to problems only after they occur with a new system to prevent problems
     before they occur. That system, which we are putting in place for meat, poultry, and
     seafood is greatly increasing our ability to make sure food is safe.

     In 1995, FDA established the Fresh Produce Subcommittee of the National Advisory
     Committee on Microbial Criteria for Food. The subcommittee has been defining the
     problem of pathogens in fresh produce and devising appropriate preventive and control
     measures.

     In January, we announced several additional steps to improve the safety of our food.      The
     President asked Congress to add $43 million to our food safety budget to fund a
     nationwide early-warning system for foodbome illness, increase seafood safety
     inspections, and expand food-safety research, training, and education. We are hopeful
     Congress will provide the funds we requested and beginning next month we will be using
     that money to further reduce the incidence of foodbome illness.

     This new initiative is the natural next step. With significant measures already taken to
     ensure the safety of meat, poultry, and seafood, we are now directing our efforts to the
     produce consumed by Americans.


Q:   Given the dramatic increase of food imported into the U.S., and the seemingly related
     increases in outbreaks in foodbome disease, shouldn't the Administration be taking more
     immediate steps to protect Americans from unsafe foreign food?
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
A:   First, it is important to remember that the experts in food safety have not concluded that
     there is an increase in outbreaks offoodbome illness in the U.S. that is the result of
     imported food.

     Even though our food supply is among the safest in the world, each year there are still
     millions of Americans who get sick from the food they eat. The overwhelming majority
     of these cases are what is known as sporadic illnesses. These illnesses are isolated cases
     and are not caused by a single, specific contaminated food. An "outbreak" of foodbome
     disease is typically when many people become sick from being exposed to the same
     source of contaminated food.

     As a result of steps we have taken over the last four years, we are doing a more thorough
     job looking for outbreaks than we have ever done before. Experts we have consulted say
     that our improved surveillance is one of the primary reasons we are hearing about more
     food-related illnesses. We our catching and quickly responding to outbreaks of
     foodbome illness that we often missed in the past.

     Second, the steps we are taking today are on top of other actions the Administration has
     already taken. For example, next week we will complete work on the first generation of
     an FDA automated import system known as OASIS (Operational and Administrative
     System for Import Support). OASIS ties together electronically 435 ports of entry
     around the U.S. and dramatically increases the efficiency of FDA inspection efforts. In
     the past, some importers engaged in what was known as "port-shopping" taking
     potentially harmful products through the busiest ports where their products would receive
     the least scrutiny. OASIS was designed to end that practice.


Q:   How will the new guidance that you have asked the Secretaries to develop make our food
     safer?

A:   Today the produce industry is required to produce safe food, but there is not agreement on
     how to do so. That is like telling drivers in a big city to drive carefully without providing
     them road signs or traffic lights. Under our new plan government food safety agencies
     will work with industry to develop the industry specific guidance that will alert them to
     the potential hazards and the hazard-reducing steps they should take to produce safe food.
      For example, FDA will issue guidance on good agricultural practices to minimize the
     risk of microbial contamination. This guidance will address, among other things,
     standards for worker and field sanitation, the proper and safe uses of water, and manure
     application.


Q:   Does FDA have the authority to prevent the entry of foods that are contaminated?

A:   FDA has authority to refuse the importation of foods that appear to be adulterated.
     However, FDA does not examine every entry of food. With new legislation, FDA could
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
     declare foods from a country to be adulterated if that country's food system does not
     provide the same level of protection that is provided for domestic products. USDA
     already has comparable authority for meat and poultry products.


Q:   Are the steps you are taking today sufficient to ensure the safety of imported produce?

A:   We are committed to ensuring that the food that we eat is safe. It is important to keep in
     mind that there are no data to indicate that there is more of a problem with imported
     fruits and vegetables compared to domestic products. However, some outbreaks have
     been traced back to imports, and health officials want to improve the safety of imported
     fruits and vegetables, as well as domestic products. The steps we are taking today are
     adding additional layers of protection to a food supply that is already among the safest in
     the world. The steps we are announcing today represent the best ideas of our experts in
     government and the experts outside government in both industry and public health.


Q:   Why didn't you address this problem in the President's food safety initiative announced
     in Mayor in the budget the President introduced last January?

A:   The food safety initiative did identify both imports and raw produce as areas of concern.
     In fact, in the food safety report to the a President that was issued in May that
     accompanies his budget request, we proposed specific steps to further improve the safety
     offruits and vegetables and imported foods. The additional measures we are· putting in
     place build on our plan.


Q:   Since RACCP has been successful for meat, poultry, and seafood, why don't you require
     RACCP for fresh fruits and vegetables?

A:   RACCP is a science-based approach for identifying and controlling hazards in food
     production. We need better scientific data before we can develop RACCP for fresh
     fruits and vegetables. The Administration's plan is to develop and issue guidance that
     will help companies interpret existing safety requirements for fruits and vegetables, and
     that will lead to the science needed for RACCP. The agency is contemplating guidance
     on basic, common-sense sanitation and employee practices in the form of Good
     Agricultural Practices (GAPs) for farms and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs)
     applicable for those who sort, wash, and otherwise handle fresh fruits and vegetables.


Q:   Would country of origin labeling be an effective way to help consumers protect
     themselves?

A:   No. Country of origin labeling is not an effective food safety control measure. Imports
     are not all unsafe, any more than all domestic products are safe, so the consumer cannot
