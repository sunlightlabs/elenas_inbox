  TEXT:
  Attached is the final version of the Indian Education proposal.  Elena,
  you had wanted a new heading on the Tribal School Construction Proposal,
  but I wasn't clear on how you wanted it, so it would be pure luck if I
  changed it to what you had in mind. Feel free to fix i t again.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                      MIKE COHEN

SUBJECT:              Proposed Budget Initiatives for Indian Education


        Last July, a coalition of education-oriented groups from Indian Country proposed a
Comprehensive Federal Indian Education policy statement, which emphasized the importance of
Tribal governance of Indian Education, the preservation and revitalization of Native languages
and cultures, and the need for equitable access to education resources. The coalition also
proposed an Executive Order to implement this policy vision.

       This proposal has been under review by DPC staff and the Domestic Policy Council
Working Group on American Indians and Alaska Natives. Pending a determination as to
whether the proposed Executive Order is desirable and likely to be effective in accomplishing its
aims, we have begun to identify steps that can be taken right now to improve education for
Native American students in schools controlled by the BIA and Tribes, as well as in the public
schools attended by large numbers of Indian students.

        The full set of initiatives we have developed summarized below. Most involve ensuring
that new education proposals and existing funding streams effectively target resources to schools
in Indian Country. In one area -- school construction and maintenance -- we are going further by
proposing a significant increase in funds over previous appropriations levels.

Tribal School Construction Proposal

        The BIA operates 185 residential and day schools serving 51,000 Native American
students, approximately 10% of all Native American students in grades K-12. Enrollment in all
BIA schools has increased by 25% since 1987. Enrollment in just the day schools has increased
47% since 1987 and 24% since 1992. Consequently, BIA schools have experienced significant
problems with overcrowding. In addition, according to a forthcoming GAO report, BIA schools,
compared to schools nationwide, (1) are generally in poorer physical condition; (2) have more
''unsatisfactory environmental factors"; (3) more often lack key facilities required for education
reform (e.g., science labs); and (4) are less able to support computer and communications
technology. Overall, they are in worse condition than even inner-city schools.

        We are recommending an increase of$75 million over the FY 1998 appropriations (and
an increase of $69.4 million over the Department of Interior FY 1999request) for three Bureau
of Indian Affairs accounts for New School Construction, Facilities Improvement and Repairs,
and Annual Operation and Maintenance.
                                                                     Hc;.;,Dump Conversion

        The proposed increase would double funding for new school construction and for
significant improvements and repairs of existing facilities. Compared to the BIA FY 1999
request, this step would double the number of new schools to be built from 2 to 4, and increase
the number of schools undergoing significant improvements or repairs from 6 to 22. The higher
budget request would also provide funds for needed portable classrooms, roof replacements, and
other repairs. In addition, the annual maintenance budget would increase by 32%, which would
help reduce the cost of future repairs.

 Total                    $126 million             $131.8 million           $201 million




        The Tribes would view this proposal as a significant step forward in improving the
quality of education for Indian students. Congressional delegations from the affected states also
would receive the proposal warmly.

         This proposal is especially important if you choose to propose a new school construction
initiative on the tax side, because Tribes do not issue bonds for this purpose. Even if you choose
to propose a school construction initiative on the spending side, this initiative would be valuable.
 In the Administration's school construction proposal last year, 2%'ofthe funds were set aside
for a direct appropriation for Tribal schools, over and above the accounts discussed here. This
funding, however, is contingent on the passage of a school construction proposal, and in any
event, is insufficient to meet the Tribes' needs.

      We have developed this proposal with the involvement and support ofOMB, the
Department of the Interior and the Department of Education.

Other Initiatives

        We are working to make sure that other education initiatives that are proposed for FY99
include an appropriate set-aside for BIA schools and, where feasible, for public schools that serve
a large concentration of Native American students. These include:
                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

           Education Opportunity Zones. A percentage of grant funds will be set aside for
            administration by the BIA, and the Education Department will be encouraged to provide
            at least one grant to a rural school district with a large percentage of Native American
            students.

           Early Intervention College/School Partnerships. We are working to determine the best
            ways to ensure that Tribal Colleges can effectively participate in this initiative, as well as
            to fund other college/school partnerships in communities with a large percentage of
            Native American students.

           Child Care. The Child Care Block Grant already contains a set aside for administration
            by BIA. Proposed funding increases in this program will automatically benefit programs
            serving Native Americans on reservations.

           Technology. This year the BIA launched Access Native America, an initiative to
            implement the four pillars of your technology challenge and to connect all schools,
            classrooms, and libraries to the Department of Interior's Internet backbone by the year
            2000. Within the past month, DPC arranged a meeting between BIA staff and the
            Schools and Libraries Corporation to help Tribal schools take advantage of the e-rate.
            As a result, the Corporation has agreed that BIA can apply for the e-rate on behalf of all
            Tribal schools, and BIA has begun to develop materials and plan training so that schools
            can complete the necessary applications.

           Teacher Pr<maration and Recruitment. This initiative, which you announced at the
            NAACP Convention on July 17, helps to prepare and recruit teachers to serve in
            high-poverty urban and rural communities. At the time this proposal was developed, we
            did not target funds to Tribal schools. Weare in the process of preparing new legislative
            language to take care of that omission, and will work with our Congressional allies to
            incorporate it into our proposal.
