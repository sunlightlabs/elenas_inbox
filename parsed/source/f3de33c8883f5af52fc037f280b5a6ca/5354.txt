                    CHALLENGE GRANTS FOR URBAN AND RURAL
                        EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ZONES
                           Proposed FY 99 Budget Initiative
                            DRAFT -- November 20, 1997

This paper describes a new initiative to select a number of inner cities and poor rural areas as
Educational Opportunity Zones, in which schools would receive special assistance in exchange for
adopting policies such as extra help to students to master the basics, strengthening teaching and
school leadership, no' social promotion, removal of poorly performing teachers, fIxing failing schools,
and public school choice. Specifically. school districts competing for grants would be challenged
to show how they will hold students. staff. and schools accountable and use all available
resources to help students reach high standards:

·      Student Accountability: To be selected as Education Opportunity Zones, participating
       districts must implement policies requiring. students to meet challenging academic
       standards at key transition points before being promoted or graduating from high school.
       Districts would have to show how their regular instructional program, together with extra
       help for students identified as needing such assistance, would combine to ensure the
       academic success of every child. Critical to these efforts would be how schools will
       identify kids at risk of failure and how they will use Title I funds and other federal, state
       and local resources to provide extra help to these students, such as extended day
       enrichment/tutoring programs, Saturday academies, and summer school.

        ·      Districts would use challenge grant funds, and other funds, to support expanded
               learning opportunities for students that need it.

·       Staff Accountability: Educational Opportunity Zones must clearly spell out hoW they will
        reward outstanding teaching, and also how they will identify poorly performing teachers
        and provide them with extra help or counsel them out of the classroom. Rewards and
        incentives should be offered to individuals or teams of teachers who meet high standards.
         For example, individual teachers should be assisted to attain certification by the National
        Board for Professional Teaching Standards and should be rewarded when they do, and
        districts should develop strategies for using these teachers in schools where they are
        needed the most. At the same time, participating districts must develop aggressive
        approaches for identifying failing teachers, and getting extra help to those who can
        improve their performance, and counseling those who can't out of the profession quickly
        and fairly.

        Educational hnprovement Zones must also show how they will recruit and build
        leadership capacity among the district's principals, and how they will develop rewards
      , and sanctions for principals based on performance.

        ·      Districts would use challenge grant funds for such activities as rewarding effective
               teams ofteachers, paying fees and bonuses for those seeking national certification
               or other rigorous advanced study, and designing and implementing effective
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion



                                                                                                       2

               approaches for identifying, counseling or removing chronically failing teachers.
               Districts could also use funds to design and implement principal leadership
               institutes, with a focus on effective curriculum and instruction.

·      School Accountability: Finally, Educational Opportunity Zones must show how they will
       develop clear criteria and hold individual schools accountable for high standards of
       discipline and achievement. Schools showing significant gains should be rewarded
       through such incentives as financial bonuses or recognition programs. Conversely,
       failing schools must be given high quality technical assistance and overhauled using
       proven reform models, or, if schools still don't improve, they should be shut down and
       reconstituted, perhaps as smaller schools-within-schools or independent public charter
       schools. Educational Opportunity Zones must also demonstrate how they will ensure that
       families have the opportunity to choose which public school their children will attend, or
       that families have a choice of designs for their neighborhood school, especially if the
       neighborhood school doesn't provide a safe and academically challenging environment.

       ·       Districts would use challenge grant funds to reward effective schools and to
               intervene in and, where necessary, close down and replace schools that are failing.
                This would include assisting with professional development and other expenses
               of implementing proven reform models. Funds could also be used to design and
               launch programs to improve information on public school choices for parents.

Eligibility: Districts eligible for the competition would be a subset ofthose districts that qualify
as underserved areas in the Administration's Teacher Recruitment and Preparation Initiative:
those with at least 20% poor students, or with at least 20,000 poor students, or that are the three
school districts in the state with the largest number of poor children, provided that the districts
are located either in a central city or a non-metropolitan area.

Grant Awards and Funding: In the first year of the initiative, 3-year competitive grants would
be awarded by the Department of Education to 10-15 urban and 10-15 rural school districts
(including districts serving Native American students) selected as Educational Opportunity
Zones. Each urban grant would be worth approximately $10-25 million, and each rural grant
would be worth up to $2 million, with a total FY 99 request of$320 million.

Grantee Selection and Accountability for Results: Grantees would be selected through a
rigorous peer review process. Distinguished peer reviewers would work with finalists to identify
rigorous annual benchmarks of progress in implementing the district reform plan, as well as
indicators of student achievement to be reached by the end of the third year. A consistent group
of peer reviewers would reconvene each year to consider progress made by grantees and
recommend to the Secretary whether funding should continue. At the end of three years, peer
reviewers would carefully review measurable progress in student achievement to recommend
whether the grant should be extended for an additional two years.

                                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                                                       Hex·Dump Conversion

                                                                                                                3

          Effective, Flexible Use of Other Resources: There would be no explicit matching requirement
          for the first three years of a grant, although applicants would be challenged to show (and given
          priority for showing) how the district will use all available resources ~- federal, state, and local,
          as well as any business or foundation funds -- in order to carry out its reform strategy, and how it
          intends to maintain the reform effort once federal fund are no longer available. Applicants
          would also be invited to identify any barriers to carrying out the refonn plan posed by existing
          federal education requirements. Successful applicants will be given expedited consideration for
          waivers under existing authorities. If grants are extended beyond three years, applicants would
          be required to meet a matching requirement phased in to 50%, encouraging institutionalization
          and stability of the initiative.

          Resources to Disseminate Lessons Learned. A small proportion of funds (no more than [5%])
          would be set aside for national leadership activities, which would include: brokering technical
          assistance to meet the needs of successful grantees; using technology to establish a ''virtual urban
          and rural office" at Education and help districts consult with each other on overcoming obstacles;
          and documenting success and lessons learned and disseminating that information nationwide.

          Legislative Authority: This initiative would likely utilize existing legislative authority, such as
          the Title I demonstration authority in ESEA § 1502(a).

          Looking Ahead: This initiative should be viewed as testing out ideas for possible wider
          inclusion in the next ESEA reauthorization.
