MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          RAHM EMANUEL
               BRUCE REED

RE:                  MEETING WITH SENATOR FEINSTEIN ON FIREARMS ISSUES

             Senator Feinstein wants to discuss 3 fireanns issues with you that were recently
featured in an LA Times series criticizing the California and federal laws banning assault
weapons. These include: (1) the importation oflarge capacity ammunition feeding devices; (2)
"copycat" or "sporterized" assault weapons; and (3) enforcing federal fireanns laws at gun
shows. This memorandum summarizes these issues and provides some suggested talking points
for your meeting.

I. LARGE CAPACITY AMMUNITION FEEDING DEVICES

           The assault weapons ban generally prohibited the possession of ammunition clips with
a capacity of more than 10 rounds, but specifically grandfathered clips manufactured on or before
September 13,1994. Initially, The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Fireanns (ATF), with
guidance from the Domestic Policy Council (DPC), interpreted this prohibition to include the
continued importation of all large capacity clips -- no matter when they were manufactured.
This interpretation was based on the fact that clips not in the country before the effective date
could not have been lawfully possessed at that time an, thus, were banned from importation.

        Several importers, however, brought suit challenging this narrow interpretation of the
law, and the Department of Justice advised that the ATFIDPC position was not likely to hold up
in court and should be reversed. As a result, in July of 1996, ATF reinterpreted the clip
provision acknowledging that pre-ban clips could be imported, but requiring importers to present
reasonable evidence that clips to be imported were manufactured on or before the ban's
enactment. Thus, as of March 1, 1997, approximately 160,000 large capacity clips had entered
the country under 21 approved permits; another 20 permits had been denied for lack of evidence;
and a total of 83 approved permits seeking to import more than 2 million large clips remained
outstanding. (NB: There are no definitive numbers about how many domestically produced
clips have been grandfathered, but it is estimated that there are many millions of existing -- and
reusable -- clips that will last a lifetime.)

        Senator Feinstein opposed the language in the assault weapons ban grandfathering large
clips and supports repealing it. This language, however, was inserted during the crime bill
conference by Representative John DingeU, and Administration officials and Members of
Congress involved in the negotiations have been reluctant to seek its repeal.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


         The Senator has also suggested that the Administration can, by executive order, further
restrict the number of large clips imported or increase the number of ATF agents investigating
the production of clips overseas. We are not optimistic about either of these options. First, as
previously mentioned, the Department of Justice has already overturned the ATF/ DPC initial
policy to ban the importation of all large clips. And second, A TF agents have no oversees
jurisdiction to conduct investigations and can only do so by convention or through mutual
assistance treaties with other countries_

II. "COPYCAT" OR "SPORTERIZED" ASSAULT WEAPONS

        The assault weapons ban prohibits 19 specific firearms, duplicates of those 19 and other
semiautomatic weapons that meet various criteria (i.e., those that accept a detachable magazine
and possess characteristics such as folding stocks, bayonet lugs and flash suppressors). Since
passage ofthe assault weapons ban, some gun manufacturers have adapted or "sporterized" their
assault weapons to meet the law's criteria. As a result, there are guns on the market today with
either similar names or certain similar features as assault weapons, but that otherwise comply
with the terms of the ban. In fact, despite their appearance, some of these firearms -- such as the
Israeli Military Industries Galil -- have been re-engineered and are considerably more difficult to
convert to fully automatic than their previous versions. Nonetheless, a lucrative market still
exists for "assault-type" weapons, and some manufactures -- either through brand names or
appearances -- continue to target this segment of the market.

        Senator Feinstein believes that we can do more to crack down on these new "copycat"
versions of assault weapons. We do not think this is possible without additional authority from
Congress. This was a limitation of the assault weapons ban that the Administration and
Congress accepted when they decided to endorse the FeinsteinlDeConcini approach over
Representative Schumer's. The Schumer ban granted the Treasury Department the authority to
add or delete firearms from the prohibited list.

III. ENFORCING FEDERAL FIREARMS LAWS AT GUN SHOWS

        Gun shows and flea markets are the last bastion of unregulated and undocumented
firearms transfers. Most participants are private gun owners who do not sell firearms for a
living and are generally there to buy and sell from each others' private collections. As such,
these secondary sales are generally exempt from most state and federal firearms laws, including
the 1968 Gun Control Act that gives the Treasury Department the authority to license and
regulate federal firearms dealers. However, anecdotal evidence repeatedly has shown that
violations of state and federal firearms laws often do take place at these shows. Senator
Feinstein believes that ATF should amend its internal policies and police these shows more
aggressively.

        As of March 16, 1994, ATF's policy on gun shows provides that agents must get
authorization from their local Special Agent in Charge (SAC) and have an intended subject or
target before they can attend a gun show. Prior to this date -- and in response to congressional
hearings on ATF's policies -- ATF had an even more restrictive policy that required approval
                                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

        from the Washington headquarters before an agent could attend a gun show. This is no longer
        the case, and ATF agents do attend gun shows in the course of investigations and to follow-up on
        tips from legitimate gun dealers. Additionally, ATF inspectors do attend and sponsor booths at
        all of the major gun shows -- those attended by manufacturers and gun dealers, not just private
        collectors -- and disseminate infonnation on federal gun laws.

        IV. SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS

              Senator, I share your concems with respect to the assault weapons ban and am willing to
               use the full authority of the executive branch to make sure that we do our best to enforce
               the ban's provisions.

              In fact, on 3 separate occasions I have taken executive action to crack down on assault
               weapons and gun dealers. In August of 1993, I banned the importation of assault pistols
               and toughened requirements for federal gun dealers. And in May of 1994, for foreign
               policy reasons, I banned the importation of firearms from China -- including millions of
               assault-type weapons and large capacity clips.

              Equally important, we have tried to interpret the provisions of the ban on large capacity
               clips as strictly as possible, but litigation forced us to change our position.

              So, unfortunately, I think we will need to pass new legislation that expands Treasury's
               authority if we want to include more guns and more clips -- and you know that will not be
               easy. But I am pleased to ask Rahm Emanuel, Bruce Reed and our attorneys to take one
               more look at the law and your suggestions, and to see if there is anything more we can do
               short of legislation.

              With respect to gun shows, I think you have hit on an important issue. We have had
               much success through the Brady Bill, assault weapons ban and refonns to the federal
               firearms licensing system, and gun shows should not be allowed to undermine these
               efforts.

              Still, it seems that we have little authority in this area, and that Congress has a history of
               restricting ATF's ability to aggressively enforce our gun laws. But I agree with you that
               there must be more we can do. Again, I would like to ask Rahm and Bruce to do some
               research on this and see what administrative options are available to us -- to see what
               more we might be able to do in terms offederal enforcement at these shows.
