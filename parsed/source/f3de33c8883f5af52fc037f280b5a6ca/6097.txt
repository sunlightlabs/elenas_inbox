                                  Internal Questions & Answers


1. What are the new housing vouchers the President is proposing?

        The President's budget will provide $283 million for 50,000 new housing vouchers for
welfare recipients who need housing assistance to get or keep ajob. Families could use these
housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more
stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time.
These targeted vouchers will give people on welfare a new tool to make the transition to ajob
and succeed in the work place.

        This proposal will help address the problem that in many regions, jobs are being created
far from where many welfare recipients live. Currently, about two-thirds of new jobs are being
created in the suburbs, but three of four welfare recipients live in rural areas or central cities. To
make this daily commute possible, the President is fighting for a $600 million welfare to work
transportation initiative as part of the reauthorization ofISTEA. But in some cases it makes
more sense for someone to move closer to work, and this new proposal will make that possible.

2. How are you going to pay for these new vouchers?

        Next month the President will send to Congress the first balanced budget in 30 years.
This proposal, which costs $283 million in the first year, and an estimated $1.3 billion over five
years, will be paid for through cuts in other areas of the federal budget. We believe this is a
sound investment which can be paid for in the context of a balanced budget.

3. Aren't you just replacing one form of welfare with another?

        No. Families will be eligible for these vouchers only if they are working. This is not a
free ride--while these vouchers will make housing more affordable, most families will still have
to spend about 30% of their income for rent.

4. Given the shortage of affordable housing nationwide, why give welfare recipients special
preference for these new vouchers? Will this create an incentive for people to get on
welfare in order to get housing?

        We think it makes sense to assist families who are working hard to leave welfare and
make a better life. These vouchers will only be available to those who are working and for whom
the voucher is critical to that family getting or keeping ajob. Families on welfare are already
eligible for housing assistance, although there are long waiting lists in most communities.
Besides, with the tough work requirements and time limits on welfare, we don't think people will
sign up for welfare just to get a housing voucher.

budget proposal will also help spur private-sector development of more affordable rental housing
for all low-income Americans through a 40% increase in the value of the Low-Income Housing
Tax Credit. In addition, the Administration has a long track record of working to make housing
affordable and accessible, including increasing funding for the HOME program by 50%.

5. Is there any evidence that people need this help?        How do you know it will make a
difference?

        This proposal will help address the problem that in many regions, jobs are being created
far from where many welfare recipients live. Currently, about two-thirds of new jobs are being
created in the suburbs, but three of four welfare recipients live in rural areas or central cities. To
make this daily commute possible, the President is fighting for a $600 million welfare to work
transportation initiative as part of the reauthorization ofISTEA. But in some cases it makes
more sense for someone to move closer to work, and this new proposal will make that possible.

        Because there is a major shortage of affordable housing, many welfare recipients live in
crowded conditions or substandard housing -- problems which make it difficult for them to get to
work on time every day. Overall, about 2 million poor families with children pay over 50
percent of their income for rent or live in substandard housing. Only one-quarter of welfare
recipients receive any type of housing assistance and less than half of these receive portable
housing assistance that they can use to rent housing in the private market.

6. Since demand far exceeds the number of new vouchers, isn't this just a drop in the
bucket? How will you decide who gets them? Will every community get vouchers?

        This proposal will increase the overall supply of portable housing vouchers for families
on welfare by over 10 percent -- a meaningful investment. Currently, 1.4 million households
receive portable rental assistance, of which 446,000 are families with children whose primary
source of income is public assistance.

         The vouchers will be awarded on a competitive basis to the local housing agencies.
Local applications will be developed in partnership with the state, local or tribal agency
administering Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the local entity (generally
the Private Industry Council) receiving Welfare-to-Work funds allocated on a formula basis by
the U.S. Department of Labor. HUD, working with HHS and DOL, will review local
applications and select the most promising ones based on established criteria.

        The proposal builds in considerable flexibility for local agencies to decide how to best
target the vouchers among eligible current or former welfare recipients within their community,
because different approaches will make sense in different places.
7. Won't this just encourage working people to move out of public housing, making
housing projects even worse places to live?


                                                  2
make sense for moving families from welfare to work in their community. While this proposal is
not targeted specifically at public housing residents, some local areas may elect to use the new
vouchers to help some families move out of public housing and into a privately-owned apartment
if such a move is critical to getting or keeping a job. We believe it is important to both increase
the number of working people in public housing and to provide opportunities for public housing
residents to move to private housing. These vouchers are just one part of our broader housing
strategy, which includes attracting more working people to public housing and helping more
housing residents get jobs.

8. How will the new vouchers work? How is this different from existing housing
programs?

        These new welfare to work housing vouchers would be available to families eligible for
or currently receiving welfare, or who received welfare within the past year, who need the
voucher to get or keep ajob, and who meet the criteria for Section 8. The vouchers would be
portable and could be used to rent private housing.

       Under existing programs, a family is eligible for Section 8 if its income is below 50
percent of the area median income. Currently, there are about 1.4 million units each of portable
tenant-based Section 8, project-based Section 8, and public housing.

        Section 8 tenant-based vouchers are used to rent housing in the private market. Tenants
pay the landlord approximately 30 percent of their income for rent. The public housing
authority uses federal funds to pay the landlord the difference between the "fair market rent" and
the tenant's rental payment. The average fair market rent, which varies widely around the
country, is $594 a month, the average tenant contribution is $213, and the average HUD subsidy
is $350.

        Section 8 project-based housing subsidies are not portable. They consist of rental units
in buildings owned and operated by private owners (for profit and nonprofit). These subsidies
cover part or all of the units in a particular building. Tenants pay 30 percent of their income to
the project's owner for rent. The remainder is paid by the federal government. These are not
administered by the local housing authority. Owners contract directly with HUD or through an
intermediary state housing finance agency.

        Public housing consists of rental units owned and operated by public housing authorities.
Rents are generally set at 30 percent of tenants' income and are paid to the housing authority to
help meet operating and maintenance costs. Federal subsidies also cover operating costs and are
distributed to housing authorities on a formula basis.

       The President's FY99 budget will take further steps to promote work and welfare reform
through a new plan to provide 50,000 new housing vouchers to welfare recipients who need
housing assistance in order to get or keep a job.

       Families could use these housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long
commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting
to work every day on time. These targeted vouchers will give people on welfare a new tool to

         The $283 million proposal will help address the problem that in many regions, jobs are

cases it makes more sense for someone to move closer to work 7- and this new proposal will make
that move from welfare to work possible.

How It Will Work

        These vouchers will provide States and communities with a new flexible tool to help
families who need housing assistance in order to achieve self-sufficiency.

      The additional vouchers will be available on a competitive basis to local housing agencies:
       Local housing agencies, including Indian housing authorities, may submit an application,
       developed in consultation with the state, local, or tribal welfare agency and the local
       Welfare-to-Work formula funds grantee (typically the Private Industry Council).

      The vouchers will be used where they are essential to a successful transition from welfare to
       work--that is, where housing assistance is critical for a family to get or keep a job.

      Families who receive the vouchers must be eligible for or currently receiving Temporary
       Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or have received TANF within the past year.

         The initiative recognizes the direct link between affordable housing and self-sufficiency.
Along with the Administration's proposal to increase the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, this
initiative will make decent, affordable housing available to more Americans.

       The most recent data (1993) show that approximately 2.7 million African American
households and 1.8 million Hispanic American households were eligible for but did not receive
housing assistance. These new vouchers will help address the unmet housing need for some
African American and Hispanic American families who are making the transition from welfare to
