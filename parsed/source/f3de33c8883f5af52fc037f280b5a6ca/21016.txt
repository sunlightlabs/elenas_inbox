    For your review. Thanks to last week's fire drill on the radio address,
    this is early! We plan on giving the press office the Transportation
    Department's release    which provides some additional findings of the
    overall FARS data -- to attach with the one-pager.

    I've heard a rumor that the address could get switched to a foreign policy
    message, but there's no harm in getting this ready to go.  FYI:  DOT can't
    really hold the data past this weekend, so it's not an option for later if
    we don't use it for the radio address.  I've let Christa know this.

    Thanks,
    Leanne

                                            August 15,1998

In his radio address to the nation, President Clinton will: (1) announce that, in 1997, the rate and number
of alcohol-related fatalities dropped to their lowest levels since record-keeping began in 1975; and (2)
renew his challenge to Congress to save even more lives by setting a nationwide drunk driving standard of
.08 blood alcohol content (BAC).

Drunk Driving: Reaching A Historic Low

       Fewest Alcohol-Related Deaths Since 1975. According to the Transportation Department's
        Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), the rate of alcohol-related crashes fell from nearly
        41 % in 1996 to 38.6% in 1997 -- the fIrst time that the rate dropped below 40% and the fewest
        number of alcohol-related fatalities since the Transportation Department began record-keeping in
        1975. Since 1982, the number of alcohol-related fatalities has dropped by more than a third.

       Decline in Youth Killed by Drunk Drivers. The 1997 FARS data also shows that alcohol-related
        deaths among 16 to 20 year-olds dropped 5%. Reducing the number of young people killed in
        alcohol-related crashes has been a cornerstone of the President's effort to combat drunk driving.

Working to Make _08 the Law ofthe Land

       Fighting for a Tough National Standard. President Clinton continues to challenge Congress to
        enact legislation that makes .08 BAC the legal limit for impaired driving. It has been estimated
        that if all states had .08 laws, alcohol-related deaths would decrease by 500 to 600 per year. The
        President supports bipartisan legislation that would give states three years to enact .08 legislation,
        or risk losing highway funds. Sixteen states have already adopted .08 laws: UT, OR, ME, CA,
        VT, KS, NC, NM, NH, FL, VI, HI, AL, ID, IL, and WA.

       Taking Executive Action on .08. Although Congress failed to enact .08 legislation as part of
        omnibus transportation legislation it recently passed, the President continues to lead by example.
        On March 3,1998, he directed the Secretary of Transportation to work with safety groups, States,
        Federal agencies, and others to develop a plan to: (I) make .08 BAC the standard on federal
        property; (2) work with tribes to make .08 the limit in Indian Country; and (3) launch an education
        campaign on the risks of drinking and driving. The Secretary recently submitted such a plan to
        the President, and he has accepted the Secretary's recommendations.

President Clinton: A Record o(Leadership

       Putting Safety First. Safety has always been President Clinton's highest transportation priority,
        and the decline in alcohol-related deaths announced today is a result of that commitment. This
        Administration's highway safety priorities include taking on drunk and aggressive driving, and
        increasing seat belt use.

       Zero Tolerance Now the Law in 50 States. In 1995, President Clinton fought for and signed
        legislation requiring states to have "zero alcohol tolerance" laws for youth by October 1, 1998, or
        risk losing highway funds. At that time, just 24 states and D.C. had zero tolerance laws. This
        past June, South Carolina became the 50th -- and [mal -- state to adopt a zero tolerance law.

                                    August 15, 1998

Q.   Can you explain what FARS is, and what other information is being released in it
     today?

A.   The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (F ARS) was established by the Transportation
     Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The mission
     of FARS is to make vehicle crash information accessible so that traffic safety can be
     improved. Each year, FARS documents all traffic-related fatalities by collecting data from
     the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Some of the key findings from the 1997
     FARS report include:

           Fewest Alcohol-Related Deaths Since 1975. The rate of alcohol-related crashes
            fell from nearly 41 % in 1996 to 38.6% in 1997 -- the first time that the rate
            dropped below 40% and the fewest number of alcohol-related fatalities since the
            Transportation Department began record-keeping in 1975. And since 1982, the
            overall number of alcohol-related fatalities has dropped by more than one-third.

           Decline in Youth Killed by Drunk Drivers. The 1997 FARS data also shows
            that alcohol-related deaths among 16 to 20 year-olds dropped 5%, from 2,324 in
            1996 to 2,209 in 1997.

           Alcohol a Large Factor in Fatal Crashes. Alcohol was involved in 7.0% of all
            crashes, but 38.6% of all fatal crashes. Three out of every 10 Americans will be
            involved in an alcohol-related crash some time in their lives.

           States with lowest alcohol related fatalities: Utah had the lowest percentage of
            alcohol-related fatalities (20.6%), followed by New York (27.4%). Kansas and
            Arkansas were the only other states with alcohol-related fatality rates under 30%.

           Modest Decline in Overall Number of Fatalities. Fatalities dropped slightly from
            42,065 in 1996 to 41,967 in 1997 -- 98 fewer deaths. The rounded fatality rate
            remained at the historically low level of 1.7 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles
            traveled, despite increased travel and higher speed limits. Sixty-three percent of
            those killed on the highways were not wearing seat belts.

     The Transportation DepartmentINHTSA will make the 1997 FARS database available
     today. The 1997 FARS data will also be posted on the NHTSA website next week.


Q.   Wasn't this data already released?

A.   The Transportation Department made preliminary FARS data available in May. There
     have been some small but positive changes in the final data, including a modest decrease
                                                                                   Yex-Oump Convers:on

     in the already ground-breaking alcohol fatality rate (from 39.3% to 3S.6%) as well as a
     minor decline in the overall number traffic futaiities (from 42,000 to 41,967). The final
     FARS data will also provide significantly more detailed information than what was
     previously released.


Q.   Were there declines in alcohol-related fatalities in the states with .08 BAC laws?

A.   Among the 15 states with .OS BAC laws in 1997, two-thirds (10 states) continued to
     register declines in alcohol-related fatalities. These states have shown steady progress in
     reducing alcohol-related fatalities since passage of their .OS laws. One state -- Kansas--
     had a dramatic reduction in alcohol-related fatalities in 1997 to 29.5% from 40.2% in
     1996. Of the remaining non-.OS states, about half{IS states) saw decreases in alcohol
     related fatalities between 1996-97.


Q.   Why is the President continuing to push for .08 BAC legislation when the Congress
                                recently dropped the measure out of the highway bill?
                                Do you really believe it has a chance of passing when
                                the Congress passed a large incentive grant program
                                instead of sanctions for .08?

A.   While we hope the incentive grants will serve to encourage more states to pass life-saving
     .OS laws, they really don't go far enough. The President believes we must continue to
     push for a measure to ensure that all 50 states have .OS laws. Zero tolerance for youth
     drinking and driving is a good example. Before the President fought for and signed this
     into law in 1995, after years of incentive grants, only 24 states had such laws. Three years
     after he signed a law which required states to have zero tolerance or risk losing highway
     funds, all 50 states now have them. The same thing happened with the minimum
     drinking age, which has been credited with saving thousands of lives.

     We could save an estimated 500 - 600 lives a year if every state had an .OS law -- which is
     why the President refuses to relent on this issue. He has led by example by calling for an
     .OS the standard on federal property, and will continue to push Congress to pass the
     LautenbergiLowey bill -- over the strong objections of the liquor lobby-- before it
     adjourns this year.


Q.   In March, the President signed a directive to Secretary Slater to, among other
     things, make .08 BAC the standard on federal property. What is the status?

A.   The Department of Transportation has been working with affected federal agencies to
     accomplish the President's directive. The National Park Service has initiated plans to
     conduct a rulemaking to amend its relevant regulation to lower the legal limit in park
     areas to .OS BAC. Similarly, the Department of Defense has initiated plans to amend all
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
     applicable internal directives and regulations to lower the legal limit on military
     installations. The Joint Service Committee on Miiitary jusiice is developing legislation to
     amend their Uniform Code of Military Justice, which provides the impaired drivirig
     penalties for military personnel. And the U.S. Coast Guard is working to establish a .08
     BAC standard on our nation's waterways to reduce the number of alcohol-related
     recreational boating casualties.


Q.   Is there any evidence that lowering the limit from .10 blood alcohol content (BAC)
     to .08 BAC has any real effect on reducing the number of alcohol-related crashes?

A.   Yes. To date, four studies have evaluated the effects of .08 BAC laws in the United
     States. Each study has shown that lowering the BAC limit to .08 was associated with
     significant reductions in alcohol-related fatal crashes. One key study of five states that
     lowered their BAC limit to .08 found that drunk driver fatalities were reduced by an
     average of 16%. And a Boston University study concluded that when all states lower
     their BAC limits to .08, alcohol-related deaths are expected to decrease by about 500 to
     600 every year.
                                                                                              Hex-Dump ConversIon
