      TEXT:
      This is also from Chris.  We are required by law to approve at least one
      of these plans by the end of Monday, February 2 (could postpone until
      Tuesday) .  Because of budget rollout, there is no hope of having an
      event, so we thought that the radio address is probably the only
      opportunity to make this announcment.   What do you think?==================== ATTACH

                                     Radio Address Option:
              Announcement of First State Children's Health Insurance Program Plans


     The radio address could:

           Announce that Alabama, Colorado, and South Carolina are the first states to be
            approved for the President's Children's Health Insurance Program. They will be
            able to access their share of the $24 billion for children's health.


           Highlight that this is a bipartisan achievement. Two of the three states have
            Republican governors.


           Announce that almost all states are planning coverage expansions. Another:

                   14 states's applications are currently under review for final approval

                   4 states have announced plans and will submit applications shortly

                   11 states have formal task forces or committees planning their programs


           Highlight the President's budget policies to promote children's health outreach.
            These policies include encouraging enrollment of children in places like schools and child
            care centers and expanding fund options for outreach.
