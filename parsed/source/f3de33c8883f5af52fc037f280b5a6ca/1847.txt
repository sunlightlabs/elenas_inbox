Announcement
    Today at the Early Childhood Development and Learning Conference, the President
     announced his Safe Start Initiative to help break the cycle of violence for our nation's
     youngest victims. The Safe Start Initiative will provide training to law enforcement,
     prosecutors, school personnel, probation officers, and other professionals to better .
     respond to the needs of children exposed to violence in their homes and communities.

The Problem
     Throughout America, millions of children are exposed to violence at home, in their
      neighborhoods, and in their schools. Children's exposure to violence has been
      associated with increased depression, anger, substance abuse, and lower academic
      achievement.

      In a study conducted at Boston City Hospital, lout of every 10 children seen in their
       primary care clinic had witnessed a shooting or stabbing before the age of 6-- half in their
       homes and half in the streets. The average age of these children was only 2.7 years-old.

      Children who experience violence either as victims or witnesses are at increased risk of
       becoming violent themselves. These dangers are greatest for very young children who
       depend almost entirely on their parents and care givers to protect them from harm.

The Safe Start Initiative
     The Safe Start Initiative will provide nationwide intensive training and technical
      assistance for professionals who come into contact with children that have been exposed
      to family and gang violence, violence in their community, and abuse or neglect.

      The Safe Start Initiative will give individuals who respond to children in violent
       situations new partners; a training and technical assistance center with a team of expert
       practitioners who can train others will be developed under the Initiative.

      Up to 20,000 professionals who work with children from 50 communities can receive
       Safe Start training including: law enforcement, mental health professionals, prosecutors,
       school personnel, and probation and parole officers.

      The Initiative builds on the Child Development-Community Policing Program (CD-CP)
       model started in 1991 between the New Haven Department of Police Services and Yale
       University School of Medicine. In fiscal years 1995 and 1996, the Department of Justice
       provided additional funding for the CD-CP to expand the model program to more sites
       and provide training to a wider range of individuals who come into contact with young
       children.

      The Department of Justice will allocate $700,000 of fiscal year 1997 discretionary
       funding to pay for the Safe Start Initiative.
