    YESTERDAY: NEW ECONOMIC NUMBERS SHOW ECONOMY GROWING
           STEADY AND STRONG UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON

      Yesterday, new GDP numbers showed that President Clinton's economic strategy is
working:

          Growth for the first quarter was 5.6 --the highest in a decade. Inflation remains
          low, exports rose by 8.1 , and investment in business equipment rose by 12.9
          percent --making business investment under President Clinton stronger than under
          any President since IFK.

          More than four years ago, President Clinton inherited rISIng deficits,
          unemployment at 7.5 percent, and widening income inequality. Today, because
          of President Clinton's 63 cut in the deficit and the hard work of the American
          people, we have 11.9 million new jobs, unemployment at 5.2 --the lowest in 7
          years --and low inflation and interest rates to keep the economy growing.

          President Clinton said yesterday: "It is imperative that we pass a bipartisan
          balanced budget agreement to continue this solid economic progress ... our
          economic policies and this year's healthy growth may help us cut the deficit
          for the fifth straight year --for the first time in 50 years. Now it's time to
          finish the job and balance the budget."

    TOMORROW: PRESIDENT CLINTON DEDICATES NEW FDR MEMORIAL

           President Clinton will dedicate the first Presidential memorial since FDR dedicated
   the Jefferson memorial in 1943. President Clinton will honor FDR's achievements,
   and challenge America to summon the same sense of confidence, hope, and purpose
   to meet today's challenges:

          FDR opened the doors of opportunity for all: sparking the growth of the
          great American middle class and creating the G.I. bill, the Social Security
          and unemployment systems, mortgage and bank insurance, the minimum
          wage and fair labor standards.

          FDR made America the world's indispensable nation: leading the crusade to
          free the world from tyranny, turning America into a world power and paving
          the way for the global economy.

          FDR believed in the American community, writing in the speech he was
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

working on when he died: "If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the
science of human relationships -- the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live
together and work together, in the same world, at peace."

FDR believed in our national government meeting major national challenges:
"The country needs ... bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense
to take a method and try it; if it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But
above all, try something."

As we face an age of promise and possibility as great as FDR's, President
Clinton will reaffirm FDR's legacy. As he said at the Library of Congress last
night: "Together we will renew our commitment to fight tyranny with
liberty, ignorance with knowledge, fear with hope and confidence."
