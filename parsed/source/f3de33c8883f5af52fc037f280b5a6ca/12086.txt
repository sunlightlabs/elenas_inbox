               TITLE X - PROGRAMS OF NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE

                      SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

          PART A- FUND FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF EDUCATION

        Section 1001 of the bill would amend Part A of Title X of the ESEA, which
authorizes funds to support nationally significant prograrn.·s and projects to improve the
quality of elementary and secondary education, to assist students to meet challenging
State content standards and challenging State perfonnance standards, and to contribute to
the achievement of America's Education Goals.

       Section 1001(1). Section 1001(1)(A) of the bill would amend section 10101(a) of
the ESEA to stress that the Fund for the Improvement of Education (FIE) is a program
focused on improving elementary and secondary education.

         Section 1001(1)(B). Section 1001(1)(B) of the bill would amend section
10101(b) of current law by shortening and strengthening the list of authorized uses of
funds. Authorized activities would include: (I) research, development, demonstration,
evaluation, or other activities designed to improve the quality of elementary and
secondary education; (2) activities to promote community participation in the planning,
design, and use of new and existing schools; (3) the development, implementation, and
evaluation of programs designed to foster student community service, encourage
responsible citizenship; and improve academic learning; (4) the identification and
recognition of exemplary schools and programs, such as Blue Ribbon Schools; (5) joint
activities with other agencies; (6) programs under section 10102 and section
101 03 (Character Education); (7) activities to study and implement strategies for creating
smaller learning communities; and (8) other programs, including physical education
programs, that meet the purposes of this section.

        Section 1001(1)(C). Section 1001(1)(C) ofthe bill would change section
10101(c) of the ESEA to require an applicant for an award under this section to establish
clear goals and objectives for its project and describe the activities it will carry out in
order to meet these goals and objective. It would also require recipients of funds to report
to the Secretary such information as may be required, including evidence of its progress
towards meeting the goals and objectives of its project, in order to determine the project's
effectiveness. This change would emphasize the Department's desire to ensure that the
effectiveness of all funded projects can be fully assessed. This language is also aligned
with the performance indicators in the FIE plan under GPRA.

        This section would also allow the Secretary to require recipients of awards under
this Part to provide matching funds from sources other than Federal funds, and to limit
competitions to particular types of entities, such as State or local educational agencies.
                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

            Section 1001(1)(D). Section 1001(1)(D) of the bill would amend section
     10101(d) of the ESEA to authorize such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Part
     through fiscal year 2005.

             Section 1001(2). Section 1001(2) of the bill would repeal section 10102 of the
     ESEA.

             Section 1001(3). Section 1001(3) of the bill would make substantial changes to
     section 10103 of the ESEA, relating to Character Education. It would provide for more
     funding flexibility by removing the limit of 10 grants per year and $1 million limitations
     on SEAs under current law, and authorize the Secretary to make up to 5-year grants to
     SEAs, LEAs, or consortia of educational agencies for the design and implementation of
     character education programs. These programs would be required to be linked to the
     applicant's overall reform efforts, performance standards, and activities to improve
     school climate. Allowing LEAs and consortia of educational agencies to apply would
     increase flexibility to fund innovative programs in school districts where the State is not
     interested in making an application.

              Section 1001(3) ofthe bill would also streamline the application requirements
     under current law. The application would include: (1) a description of any partnership
     and other collaborative effort between the applicant and other educational agencies; (2) a
     description of the program's goals and objectives; (3) a description of activities to be
     carried out by the applicant; (4) a description of how the programs will be linked to
     broader educational reforms being instituted by the applicant, State and local standards
     for student performance, and activities that are being carried out to improve school
     climate; (5) a description of how the applicant will evaluate its progress in meeting its
     goals and objectives; and (6) any other information the Secretary would require.

             Paragraph (3) would further require each recipient of a grant to submit a
     comprehensive evaluation on the effectiveness of its program in achieving its goals and
     objectives, including the impact of the program on students, teachers, administrators, and
     parents, to the Secretary, by the mid-point of the program, and no later than one year after
     completion of the program.

             Finally, section 1001(3) of the bill would require the Secretary to make awards
     under this section that serve different areas of the Nation, including urban, suburban, and
     rural areas.

              Section 1001(4). Section 1001(4) of the bill would redesignate section 10103 of
     the ESEA, as amended by section 1001 (3), as section 10102, and add a proposed new
     section 10103.

            Specifically, proposed new section 10103 would authorize a new program, under
     which the Secretary could make awards to SEAs, LEAs, IREs, tribal organizations, and
     other public or private agencies to carry out research; development, dissemination,




                                                  2
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

technical assistance, and evaluation activities that support character education programs
under new section 10102 of the ESEA.

        The proposed new section 10103(b) of the bill would authorize funds under this
section to be used to: (1) conduct research and development activities; (2) provide
technical assistance to the agencies receiving awards under the program, particularly on
matters of program evaluation; (3) conduct a national evaluation of the character
education program; (4) compile and disseminate information on model character
education programs, character education materials and curricula, and research findings in
the area of character education; and (5) any other information that would be useful to
character education program participants, and to other educators and administrators,
nationwide.

       Section 1001(5). Section 1001(5) of the bill would repeal sections 10104, 10105,
10106, and 10107 of the current law.


                    PART B-GIFTED AND TALENTED CHILDREN

         Section 1002 of the bill would reauthorize and make minor improvements to Part
B of title X of the ESEA, which provides financial assistance to State and local
educational agencies, institutions of higher education, and other public and private
agencies to build a nationwide capability in elementary and secondary schools to meet
the special educational needs of gifted and talented students.

         Section 1002(1). Section 1002(1) would make a technical change to the program's
short title.

        Section 1002(2). Section 1002(2) of the bill would amend section 10204(c) of
current law to require the National Center for Research and Development in the
Education of Gifted and Talented Children to focus the dissemination of the results of its
activities to schools with high percentages of economically disadvantaged students. This
modification would help to overcome the Centers current lack of targeting on low-
income schools and school districts.

       Section 1002(3). Section 1002(3) of the bill would add a new provision that
would authorize the Secretary to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs under this
Part.

       Section 1002(4). Section 1002(4) of the bill would amend section 10207 of the
ESEA to authorize such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Part through fiscal
year 2005.




                                             3
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

                        PART D - ARTS IN EDUCATION

        Section 1003 of the bill would reauthorize and streamline Part D of title X of the
ESEA, which provides financial assistance to support education reform by strengthening
arts education as an integral part ofthe elementary and secondary school curriculum.

       Section 1003(1). Section 1003(1) of the bill would strike out the heading of
subpart 1 of current law.

        Section 1003(2)(A). Section 1003(2)(A) of the bill would amend section
10401(d) of the ESEA by adding a new authorized activity, model arts and cultural
programs in the arts for at-risk children and youth, particularly programs that use arts
and culture to promote students' academic progress, to the list of authorized activities of
the Arts in Education program.

        Section 1003(2)(B). Section 1003(2)(B) of the bill would amend section 10401(f)
of the ESEA to authorize such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Part through .
fiscal year 20005.

        Section 1003(3). Section 1003(3) ofthe bill would repeal subpart 2 of current
law. This subpart has never been funded and the addition of the authorized activity in
section 10401(d) of the ESEA, noted above, would provide a more flexible authorization
for projects serving at-risk children and youth.


            PART E -INEXPENSIVE BOOK DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM

       Section 1004 ofthe bill would reauthorize without change Part E of title X of the
ESEA, which supports Reading is Fundamental, which distributes inexpensive books to
students to motivate them to read.


                          PART F - CIVIC EDUCATION

       Section 1005 of the bill would reauthorize and streamline Part F of title X of the

the Constitution ofthe United States, including the Bill of Rights, and to foster civic
competence and responsibility.

        Section 1005(1). Section 1005(1) of the bill would repeal section 10602 of
current law. This program, Instruction in Civics, Government, and the Law, was
defunded several years ago.




                                             4
                                                                               Hex·Dump Conversion

     or expand projects that benefit the educational, health, social service, cultural, and
     recreational needs of a rural or inner-city community.

              Section 1007(l)(A). Section 1007(1 )(A) of the bill would amend section
     10903(a) of the ESEA by adding language to current law to clarify that the Secretary may
     award grants to local educational agencies and community based organizations (CBOs)
     (with up to 10% of the funds appropriated to carry out this part for any fiscal year) on
     behalf of public elementary or secondary schools in inner-cities, rural areas, and small
     cities. In both cases, awards would be limited to schools or CBOs that serve communities
     with a substantial need for expanded learning opportunities due to their high proportion
     oflow-achieving students and lack of resources to establish or expand community
     learning centers.

             Section 1007(1)(8). Section 1007(1)(B) of the bill would retain the provision in
     section 10903(b) of current law requiring equitable distribution among urban and rural
     areas ofthe United States, but would delete the provision requiring equitable distribution
     among States and urban and rural areas of a State.

     years.

             Section 1007(2). Section 1007(2)(A) of the bill would amend section 10904 of
     the ESEA to change the eligible applicant for a grant under this Part from a school to a
     local educational agency (which would apply on behalf of schools) or a community-based
     organization.

             Paragraph (2)(A) would also add new language to current law to require the
     applicant to provide information that it will provide at least 50 percent of the annual cost

                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

of project activities from non-Federal sources (which may be provided in cash or in
kind), and in the fourth and fifth years of its project, to increase the percentage of the
project's cost that is paid for by funds other than those received under this Part. The
applicant would also be required to provide an assurance that in each year of the project,
it will expend, from non-Federal sources, at least as much for the services as it expended
for the preceding year. This addition to current law would allow the program to leverage
greater amounts of funding, by requiring a 100 percent match in the first three years and
an increasing match over the following two years, and would ensure that grantees do not
use Federal funds to replace funds from other non-Federal sources.

        Paragraph (2)(B) wound amend section 10904(b) of the ESEA to require the
Secretary to give priority, in all competitions, to applications that offer a broad selection
of services that address the needs of the community, that offer significant expanded
learning opportunities for children and youth in the community, and that contribute to
reducing drug use and violence.

        Paragraph (2)(C) would add new language to section 10904 of the current law to
require an application submitted by a CBO to contain evidence that affected LEAs concur
with the project. It would also allow the Secretary to waive the requirement of
10904(b)(4)(A) and permit an applicant to satisfy not more than 50 percent of the
required match with other Federal funds awarded by the Secretary.

        Section 1007(3). Section 1007(3) of the bill would amend section 10905 of the
ESEA to require that applicants provide expanded learning opportunities and eliminate
the requirement that applicants include at least four ofthe activities listed in this section.
Instead, applicants must provide educational activities and may provide a range of other
services to the community.

        Section 1007(4). Section 1007(4) of the bill would amend section 10906 of the
ESEA to clarify the definition of "community learning center" as an entity that provides
expanded learning opportunities, and may also provide services that address health, social
service, cultural, and recreational needs of the community.

       Section 1007(5). Section 1007(5) of the bill would amend section 10907 of the
ESEA to authorize such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Part through fiscal
year 2005.

        Section 1007(6). Section 1007(6) of the bill would add a proposed new section
10908 to the ESEA that allows the Secretary to use funds appropriated under this Part to
make continuation awards for projects that were funded with fiscal year 1998 and 1999
funds, under the terms and conditions that applied to the original awards. This provision
has the effect of allowing the Department to provide continuous funding for the last year
of 3-year grants made in fiscal year 1998 under the provisions of current law.

      Section 1007(7). Section 1007(7) of the bill would redesignate Part I as Part G
and make appropriate section number changes.

              PART J - URBAN AND RURAL EDUCATION ASSISTANCE

       Section 1008. Section 1008 of the bill would repeal Part J of the ESEA.


                      PART K - NATIONAL WRITING PROJECT

        Section 1009. Section 1009 of the bill would reauthorize and improve Part K of
title X of the ESEA, which authorizes a grant to the National Writing Project for the
improvement of the quality of student writing and learning, and the teaching of writing as
a learning process.

      Section 1009(1). Section 1009(1) of the bill would amend section 10991 of the
ESEA to update the findings.

        Section 1009(2). Section 1009(2) of the bill would amend section 10992 of the
ESEA to authorize the Secretary to conduct an independent evaluation of the program
administered pursuant to this part. It would also authorize such sums as may be necessary
to carry out this part for fiscal years 2001 through 2005.

       Section 1009(3). Section 1009(3) of the bill would redesignate Part K as Part H.


                  INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION EXCHANGE

        Section 1010 of the bill would reauthorize and make a minor change to the
International Education Program found in title VI of Goals 2000: Educate America Act.


        Section 1010(1). Section 1010(1) of the bill would amend section 601 of Goals
2000, by adding the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland to the definition of
"eligible country", as well as any other emerging democracy in a developing country.

       Section 1010(2). Section 1010(2) of the bill would authorize such sums as may be
necessary to carry out this part for fiscal year 2001 through 200S.

       Section 1010(3). Section 1010(3) of the bill would I:edesignate the International
