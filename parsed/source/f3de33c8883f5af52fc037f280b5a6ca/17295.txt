     President Clinton: Supporting Law Enforcement, Saving Lives
                           October 9, 1997

    At today's "Top Cop" event to honor 18 outstanding law enforcement
     officials for their heroism and exemplary service, President Clinton
     announced two initiatives strongly supported by law enforcement:

     1)    Child Safety Locks. Embracing the President's proposal, 8 major
           gun manufacturers announced that they would provide child safety
           devices with every handgun sold; and
     2)    College Scholarships. Building on legislation he signed one year
           ago, the President announced his support for a bill -- proposed by
           the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) -- to make
           college scholarships available to the children of slain state and
           local public safety officers.

    The Need for Child Safety Locks. A recent study by the Justice
     Department estimates that over one-third of all privately owned
     handguns-- 22 million-- are kept loaded and unlocked in our country.
     Other studies estimate that easy access to these weapons results in 1,500
     children (ages 14 and under) being treated in hospital emergency rooms
     every year for unintentional firearms-related injuries. Child safety devices
     are an inexpensive and effective solution to this problem.

    President Clinton: Leading by Example. By including child safety locks in
     his Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy, the President initiated a
     national debate on this issue. He proposed legislation to require federal
     gun dealers to provide these safety devices with every gun sold, and he
     directed all federal agencies to provide them with all handguns issued to
     federal law enforcement officers. By October 15th, all federal law
     enforcement officers will have been issued child safety locks.

    Firearms Industry: Following the President's Lead. Eight major gun
     manufacturers -- Glock, Beretta, Taurus, H&R, Heckler & Koch, Smith and
     Wesson, Mossberg & Sons, and SigArms announced that they would
     provide child safety devices with all of their handguns.

    Honoring Law Enforcement. Last year, President Clinton signed legislation
     to provide college scholarships of up to $4,848 per year for the children of
     slain federal law enforcement officers. Today, the President announced
     his support for NAPO's proposal to expand this benefit to include the
     children of state and local public safety officers who are killed in the line
     of duty.
