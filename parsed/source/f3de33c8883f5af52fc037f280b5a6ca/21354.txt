MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:           Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:        Minority Welfare Caseloads

       You asked us to evaluate recent reports that African American and Hispanic families are
leaving welfare more slowly than whites, and to consider what more we could do to ensure all
welfare recipients are making the successful transition from welfare to work. Below we
summarize the trends (a more detailed analysis is attached) and describe the new ideas we are
developing for consideration in your FY 2000 budget.

Trends

       We have worked closely with NEC, CEA, OMB, HHS, and the Census Bureau to
examine the most recent welfare caseload data (generally through 1997). As detailed in the
attached analysis, the data show:

1.       While the number of families receiving welfare has dropped for all groups (whites,
         blacks, and Hispanics) since 1994, the rate of decline for whites (26 percent) has far out
         paced that of blacks (18 percent) and Hispanics (9 percent). (See Table 1).

2.       Despite these different rates of caseload decline, the composition of the welfare case10ad
         has remained relatively constant since 1994, with whites declining from 37 to 35 percent
         of the caseload, blacks increasing from 36 to 37 percent, and Hispanics growing from 20
         to 23 percent. (See Table 2.)

3.       Most of the changes in the welfare caseload can be attributed to changes in the
         composition of the population as a whole -- specifically, population growth explains
         nearly two-thirds of the difference in caseload decline between Hispanics and whites and
         nearly half the difference between blacks and whites. When population growth is taken
         into account, the difference in the caseload feduction figures, which had ranged from 9
         percent for Hispanics to 26 percent for whites before adjusting for population, narrows to
         20 to 26 percent. Changes in welfare caseload composition have in fact roughly
         mirrored overall demographic changes over the last 25 years. (See Table 3.)

4.       Welfare dependency is declining for all populations. For example, 1.4 percent of whites
         were on welfare in 1997, a drop of26 percent from 1994; the percentage for blacks
         dropped 21 percent, from 10.9 to 8.6, and for Hispanics by 20 percent, from 7.0 to 5.6.
         (See Table 4.)
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

5.      Minorities on welfare are more likely to have characteristics that make it harder to leave
        the rolls. Compared with whites, blacks and Hispanics on welfare tend to have lower
        educational levels, marriage rates, and larger families. Hispanics also have less recent
        work history than whites or blacks. However, the most striking difference may be the
        geographic disparities -- blacks and Hispanics are more than twice as likely to live in
        areas of concentrated poverty and in central cities where there are fewer job opportunities.
         Overall, minorities are more likely to be long-term recipients. (See Table 5.)

6.      There is encouraging evidence that the employment rates of minority welfare recipients is
        catching up with the employment rate for whites. Between 1996 and 1998, the
        percentage of all prior year welfare recipients who were employed in the next year
        increased by 28%. The increase was highest for Hispanics (49%), followed by blacks
        (44%) and whites (5%). (See Table 6.)

7.     The trends in marriage rates and births to unmarried women could contribute to an
       increasing proportion of minority families on welfare. While the proportion of
       never-married single mothers is increasing for the entire population, the rate of increase is
       largest for Hispanic women. Also, the birth rate to unmarried teenagers remains much
       higher for blacks and Hispanics than for whites and is increasing for Hispanics while
       declining for whites and blacks. (See Table 7.)

8.     The fact that child only cases -- which are decreasing more slowly than others -- are
       disproportionately minority may contribute to the increasing proportion of minorities on
       the rolls. (See Table 8.)

        Given these data, we believe many of the initial reports about these caseload trends
exaggerated their significance, primarily by ignoring the extent to which they were related to
overall population trends. However, these data do underscore that many blacks and Hispanics
on the welfare rolls face greater obstacles to independence. Below we discuss the initiatives we
already have underway to assist those who may need more help in moving from welfare to work,
and some new ideas we are currently developing.

Current Initiatives

        As you know, several of our current initiatives are targeted at the hardest to serve welfare
recipients and those living in concentrated areas of poverty. These initiatives were implemented
in 1998, too late to influence 1994-1997 trends outlined above.

      The $3 Billion Welfare-to-Work Fund you fought for in the Balanced Budget Act is
       designed specifically to help long-term welfare recipients living in high poverty areas, and
       the fathers of their children, obtain jobs and move up a career ladder. While it is too
       early to have demographic data on the individuals served by these funds, the factors in the
       distribution formula and the individual eligibility criteria are likely to result in most of
       these funds being spent on minorities. The first of these funds were awarded in January
       1998 and are just now starting to provide individual services.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                   3


      The Welfare to Work Transportation Funds enacted in the TEA-21 transportation
       reauthorization bill will help welfare recipients and low income workers get to where the
       jobs are, often in suburban areas not served by public transportation. The law guarantees
       $50 million this coming year, and we're urging the appropriators to provide a total of
       $100 million.

      The Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers we've'proposed will help families in isolated
       urban or rural areas move closer to job opportunities. While the HUDN A appropriations
       bill is still in conference, we believe they will at least fund the House level of 18,000
       vouchers (far short of our 50,000 request, but a decent first step).

      Community Empowerment Initiatives. The Administration's Community Empowerment
       initiatives to spur economic development and job creation in distressed neighborhoods
       will also help address the geographic isolation faced by minorities on welfare.

New Initiatives

        As part of the FY 2000 budget development process, we are considering options to
further address the particular challenges faced by minorities in making a successful transition
from welfare to work including:

      Increasing investments in English-language and literacy training. This could be done by
       expanding existing Department of Education adult education programs and/or by
       dedicating Welfare-to-Work funds for job-related literacy and ESL programs, provided
       either in the workplace or at community organizations preparing individuals for
       employment.

      Expanding work-focussed drug treatment. Since many of those remaining on welfare
       suffer from drug or alcohol dependencies, we are exploring ways to tie drug treatment
       efforts to work and increase their availability.

      Ensuring Welfare-to-Work funds are targeted to the toughest areas. While the current
       Welfare to Work formula favors high poverty areas, we are going to examine whether the
       funds could be even more targeted.

      Increasing work and child support among noncustodial fathers. We are examining ways
       to increase the employment and child support payments of noncustodial parents.

         In sum, we recognize the critical importance of ensuring that all individuals on welfare
have the tools they need to make the transition to the workforce, and intend to continue to devise
strategies which, while not explicitly targeted at minorities, are aimed at those barriers
disproportionately faced by minorities on the welfare rolls.
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion      4

Table I: Rate of Caseload Decline

The number of families receiving welfare has dropped for whites, blacks and Hispanics since
1994 (when caseloads peaked nationally), but the rate of decline for whites has far out paced that
of others, particularly Hispanics.

 * We do not yet have more recent data, or state-specific data, that we consider accurate. In July, The New York
Times reported more recent data provided by some states, but HHS believes that data, particularly for New York and
California, may contain significant reporting errors due to states implementation of the new T ANF data reporting
system.

Table 2: Overall Composition of Caseload

Despite these different rates of case10ad decline, the composition of the welfare caseload has
remained relatively constant, at least on a national basis.

Table 3: Effects of Changes in Overall Population

There are a number of factors that appear to contribute to the different rates at which caseloads
are declining for different racial and ethnic groups. The most important appears to be the
disparate rates of population growth for the different racial and ethnic groups. Controlling for
population trends greatly diminishes the difference between the welfare caseload declines for
                                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

minorities and whites. Specifically, between 1994 and 1997, population growth explains nearly
two-thirds of the difference in caseload decline between Hispanics and whites and nearly half the
difference between blacks and whites. In other words, if all three groups had experienced the
same rate of population growth, their rate of welfare caseload decline would have been much
more similar. Adjusted for population growth, the Hispanic case10ad drop would have been 20
percent rather than 9 percent, and the black rate would have been 21 percent rather than 18
percent.

The racial/ethnic composition of welfare caseloads has been changing gradually over the last 25
years,roughly mirroring overall demographic trends. Whites gradually declined from 38 percent
to 35 percent in 1997. The proportion of blacks has generally declined, from 46 percent in 1973
to 37 percent in 1997. The most significant trend is the increase in the Hispanic portion ofthe
caseload, from 13 percent in 1973 to 23 percent in 1997.

Table 4: Welfare Dependency

While minorities are more likely to be on welfare, this rate has dropped significantly for alLthree
groups since 1994. Again, the rate of decline is fastest for whites and slowest for Hispanics.

Minorities on welfare disproportionately share characteristics that make it harder to leave the
rolls. Compared with whites, blacks and Hispanics on welfare tend to have lower educational
levels, marriage rates, and larger families. Hispanics also have less recent work history than
whites or blacks. However, the most striking difference may be the geographic disparities --
blacks and Hispanics are more than twice as likely to live in areas of concentrated poverty and in
central cities where there are fewer job opportunities.

Minorities are more likely to be long-term welfare recipients. For example, in 1997 20 percent
of blacks on welfare have been on the rolls for at least five continuous years, compared to 19
percent for Hispanics and 14 percent for whites (data are for the first nine months of 1997).

Table 6: Employment Rate of Welfare Recipients

There is encouraging evidence that the employment rates of minority welfare recipients (people
on welfare in one year who were working the following year) is catching up with the employment
rate for whites.

Table 7: Trends in Marriage Rates and Births

The trends in marriage rates and births to unmarried women could contribute to an increasing
proportion of minority families going on welfare. While the proportion of never-married single
mothers is increasing for the entire population, the rate of increase is largest for Hispanic women.

 White                                         17%                     21%             24%

 Black                                         51%                     55%              8%

 Hispanic                                      33%                     42%             27%

Also, the birth rate to unmarried teenagers remains much higher for blacks and Hispanics than
for whites. While the rate is decreasing for blacks and slightly for whites, it continues to
increase for Hispanics. For example, between 1991 and 1996, the rate of births to unmarried
teenagers decreased 18% for blacks and 4% for whites, but increased 3% for Hispanics.

Table 8: Child Only Cases
One of the factors which could contribute to the increasing proportion of minorities on the
caseload is the fact that minorities are disproportionately represented in child-only cases, which
are decreasing more slowly than cases headed by adults.

    * These data are only available through June 1997.
Between 1996 and 1997, the rate of decline for cases headed by an adult was at least twice that
for child-only cases (Note: this understates the rate of decline because it is an average monthly
figure based on only the first nine months of 1997, the most recent available data). Child-only
cases are those in which the parent or adult is not part of the caseload for one of several reasons:
e.g., adult is not a citizen but the child is; child is being cared for by a relative who is not part of
the case (kinship care), etc. Child-only cases are not expected to decline due to welfare to work
efforts.
