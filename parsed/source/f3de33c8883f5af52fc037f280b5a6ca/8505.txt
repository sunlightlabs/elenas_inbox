TEXT:
Below is the VA/HUD FY99 Appropriations Senate SAP. The Senate expects
to begin consideration TODAY around noon. Therefore, please provide
comments/clearance no later than 12:30pm. Thank you.

S. 2168 -- DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIESAPPROPRIATIONS
BILL, FY 1999                                            (Sponsors:
Stevens (R), Alaska;            Bond (R), Missouri)


       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on S. 2168, the Departments of Veterans Affairs


and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Your
consideration of the AdministrationD,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate the PresidentD,s priorities within the 302(b) allocation.
However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary
investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result, a variety of
critical programs are underfunded, as discussed below.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to
offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.   The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
in mandatory and other programs available to help finance .this spending.
In the recently enacted Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad,
bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface
transportation programs paid for with mandatory offsets.   The Committee
has used part of one such offset in its version of the bill, and we
encourage the Congress to take advantage of such additional offsets.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Committee-reported bill. We look forward to working with you to resolve
these concerns as the bill moves forward.

Department of Housing and Urban Development

        The Administration is deeply concerned about the funding levels
provided for key programs within the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, particularly for welfare-to-work vouchers and other programs
such as the Community Empowerment Fund that would expand job opportunities.

         The Administration is very disappointed by the Committee's
decision to fund only 7,000 incremental vouchers through a $40 million
"Self-Sufficiency" housing vouchers pilot program that earmarks funds for
seven specified cities.   In light of recent studies that show historically
high unmet housing need among very low-income Americans, however, the
Administration believes it is critical for the Congress to fund the entire
50,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers provided for in the President's
request.    Moreover, these welfare-to-work vouchers should be made
available in a way that ensures vouchers are distributed to places with
both the greatest need and the most effective program design.   Full
finding for welfare-to-work housing vouchers will support implementation
of welfare reform by assisting those welfare recipients who need housing
assistance to get or keep a job.

        The Administration encourages the Congress to fund fully the
President's request for $400 million for a Community Empowerment Fund to
generate jobs in distressed communities.  The Committee provides only $85
million as a set-aside within the existing CDBG program, with over 75
percent earmarked for specific projects.

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's decision to fund a
number of programs at the levels requested and to renew all expiring
section 8 contracts. Likewise, we appreciate the Committee's decision to
increase funding for Homeless Assistance Grants above FY 1998 levels.  We
would strongly oppose, however, a rigid set-aside for permanent housing,
which would reduce the ability of each local entity to adopt the most
effective response to the homeless challenge unique to that area.
Further, the Administration is disappointed by the absence of funding for


Regional Opportunity Counseling, a voluntary effort to expand the housing
and employment opportunities available to low-income families.   We urge
the Senate to provide additional resources for the Fair Housing
Initiatives Program in order to reduce housing discrimination that remains
all too common.  The Administration encourages the Senate to fund fully a
number of other areas -- Brownfields, Regional Connections, Office of Lead
Hazard Control, and the Partnership for Advancing Technologies in Housing
(PATH) Initiative.

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's decision to raise
the limit on FHA single-family loans. The Administration urges the
Congress to provide even greater homeownership opportunities by increasing
FHAD,s loan limit to the GSE "conforming" limit.   In addition, the
Administration urges the Congress to adopt the Administration's proposal
to reform RUD's single-family property disposition program, which would
produce substantial savings by improving the efficiency of FHAD,s property
disposition processes.

        Finally, the Administration is concerned about the Committee's
decision not to fund $304 million in FHA administrative expenses.
Appropriated funds are FHA's only source for contracting for vital
management services for its insurance funds.

Environmental Protection Agency

        The Administration has several major concerns with the
CommitteeD,s mark for the Environmental Protection Agency.   In particular,
the Administration strongly objects to the action of the Committee to
reallocate approximately $600 million of funds that were already agreed to
last year to accelerate Superfund cleanups.  This reduction would delay
cleanups at sites nationwide and needlessly jeopardize public health.   The
Administration urges the Senate to restore Superfund to the levels agreed
to last year for FY 1999 and to delete restrictive language preventing use
of brownfields funding for revolving loan funds.

        While the Administration appreciates the increases provided for
the Clean Water Action Plan, we urge the Senate to provide the
PresidentD,s full request to prevent pollution run-off and protect public
health.  In addition, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to
restore the $50 million request to help improve water quality in Boston
Harbor and prevent beach closings.

        The Administration strongly opposes the CommitteeD,s $91 million
reduction in EPA funding for the Climate Change Technology Initiative.
This high-priority program should be fully funded to cut energy usage,
save consumers money, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We will work
with the Congress to restore requested funding as the bill moves forward.
The Administration is also concerned about the report language relating to
this initiative, which is so broad that it could be interpreted to
preclude or terminate many on-going activities that are already authorized
by existing laws and treaties.  In addition, the Administration objects to
the report language requiring a detailed Government Performance and
Results Act (GPRA) plan relating to Climate Change activities.  Such a
plan is premature and appears to require us to set goals for implementing
the Kyoto Protocol before it has been ratified by the Senate.

        The Administration is also concerned with the large number of
unrequested, earmarked projects in the Committee mark for EPA,
particularly when the Committee has reduced several other high-priority
Administration initiatives, including right-to-know programs, Montreal


Protocol, GLOBE, and Mexican border wastewater treatment funding.

Council on Environmental Quality

         The Administration appreciates the modest increase over the FY
1998 level provided for the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).
However, we strongly believe that in order to allow CEQ to carry out its
environmental mission and reinvention efforts, the full requested level
should be provided, and language prohibiting use of detailees should be
deleted.

Corporation for National and Community Service

        The Administration is deeply concerned that freezing funding for
the Corporation for National and Community Service at the FY 1998 level,
$74 million below the President's request, will not allow the Corporation
to finance nearly 5,000 AmeriCorps tutors targeted to recruit, organize,
and manage more than 60,000 volunteers as part of America Reads, the
Administration's effort to raise student literacy through the use of
tutors to supplement the school day activities.

Community Development Financial Institutions Fund

        The Administration strongly opposes the CommitteeO,s decision to
reduce the request for the Community Development Financial Institutions
Fund by $70 million.  This cut would severely reduce the FundO,s ability
to leverage investments, loans, and financial services in the countryO,s
most distressed communities.

Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation

        The Administration is disappointed by the CommitteeO,s decision
not to fund the full request for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation
(NRC).  The NRC has a proven successful record of leveraging private
sector resources to promote homeownership and helping to strengthen
Americas communities. The Administration urges the Senate to fully fund
the PresidentO,s request of $90 million, which includes a $25 million
homeownership initiative that seeks to create 10,000 new homeowners
through FY 2000.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration

        The Administration is pleased that the Committee has fully funded
the PresidentO,s request for NASA.  We hope that it is possible to reach
an accommodation on overall funding in the bill that can satisfy both the
Administration's unfunded priorities in other agencies and the Committee's
interest in providing increased funding for NASA.  As indicated above, the
Administration looks forward to working with Congress to identify
mandatory and other program savings so that increases in spending, such as
the additional spending for NASA, is possible.

        We are concerned by the increased number of appropriation accounts
for Space Station and other activities.  The redirection of key resources
to implement this change could threaten NASAO,s Year 2000 conversion
effort and pose an audit risk.   The Administration is prepared to work
with the Congress to control development costs of the International Space
Station better, while also providing the flexibility necessary to deal
with unanticipated requirements.   The Administration is also concerned
about the very large number of unrequested, site-specific earmarks, which
would have the effect of circumventing the competitive, peer review


    process.

    Federal Emergency Management Agency

            The Administration appreciates the level of funding provided by
    the Committee for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   However, we
    believe that the $25 million reduction to the PresidentO,s request for
    pre-disaster mitigation grants is shortsighted.  These grants would help
    reduce the costs of future disasters by leveraging local and
    private-sector support for enhanced mitigation efforts at the State and
    community level. We urge the Senate to fund fully the PresidentD,s
    request for this important initiative.  In addition, we urge the Senate to
    approve the PresidentD,s recent request for funding to help States and
    communities prepare for potential terrorist incidents involving chemical
    and/or biological weapons.

    National Science Foundation

            Given the budget constraints facing the Committee, the
    Administration appreciates the effort to provide a $215 million increase
    over the FY 1998 level for the National Science Foundation (NSF).
    However, the Administration is concerned that the elimination of funding
    for the proposed Polar Cap Observatory (PCO) would hamper scientists'
    further understanding of the Earth's upper atmosphere as well as the study
    of conditions in the space environment that can influence the performance
    and reliability of satellites, communications, navigation, and electric
    power distribution systems. The Administration is firmly committed to
    NSFD,s basic research function, which not only promotes scientific
    advancement but also contributes to economic development. We strongly urge
    the Senate to provide the full increase requested for NSF. The
    Administration is also concerned about the number and specificity of
    earmarks related to NSF, which come dangerously close to infringing on the
    merit-based review and decision-making process.

    Administrative Provision

            Finally, the Administration supports the CommitteeD,s goal of
    ensuring a safe and environmentally sound ship scrapping policy. The
    specific requirements in the bill, however, raise implementation issues
    such as EPAD,s certification of the enforcement of other countriesD,
    laws. The Administration believes that a starting point to develop a more
    workable approach to achieve these protection aims would be to build on
    the recommendations of the Interagency Ship Scrapping Review Panel.   The
    Administration is committed to working with Congress to resolve these
    concerns and to finding mutually acceptable solutions that achieve these
    important objectives.
