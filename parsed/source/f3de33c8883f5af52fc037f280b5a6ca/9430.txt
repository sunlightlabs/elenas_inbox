TEXT:
Attached is a revised draft that I have also forwarded to OMB and ED for
comment.  It reflects most of the edits Bruce suggested, and one
additional appropriations item (Eisenhower Professional Development) so
that it fully tracks the K-12 appropriations issues we and/or ED has
raised since the House approps bill was marked-up.

I'll forward any revisions after I get feedback from OMB and ED. In
addition, this will need further editing. But it should work well now to
convey the substance we need,==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ===================
