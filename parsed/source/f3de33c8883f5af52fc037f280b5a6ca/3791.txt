MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:        Bruce Reed
             Paul Weinstein

SUBJECT:     Update on Community Empowerment Agenda

The following memorandum discusses the latest developments concerning your Community
Empowennent Agenda:

   1. Economic Development That Works

         Unemployment Has Started to Decline in Cities: Unemployment, from 1993 to
          1996, dropped more in central cities than in their surrounding suburbs --and each
          of the ten largest American cities has a lower unemployment rate today than in
          1993.

         After Years on the Rise, the Poverty Rate Has Decreased
          Slightly: --Nationwide the poverty rate in cities rose 50 percent from 14.2 percent
          in 1970 to 21.5 percent in 1993. From 1993 to 1995, there was a slight decline to
          20.6 percent.

   2. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFD Fund)

         Second Round Awards: The CDFI Fund is in the process of reviewing its second
          round of applications. The Fund is expected to make over $30 million in awards
          before October 1.

         CDFI Fund Budget Increase: The House has voted to fully fund the CDFI
          program at $125 million for FY98. However, the Senate has not provided any
          money for the CDFI Fund. The House-Senate Conference is tentatively
          scheduled for September.

        CDFI Fund's First Round: The CDFI Fund's first round of awards totaled $37.2
         million in investments in 32 CDFls, including community development banks,
         loan funds, credit unions, venture capital funds, and micro enterprise loan funds.
         In the next two to three years the CDFI Fund's investments are expected to
         leverage three to four times the investments in total capital raised for these
         institutions. Over the long term, the Fund's investments are expected to leverage
         10 to 20 times more activity by the CDFls.

         New Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities: The reconciliation bill
          includes a second round of Empowerment Zones -- 15 urban and 5 rural EZs. The new
          EZs will benefit from a different blend of tax credits from the first-round EZs. They will
          be eligible for the Brownfields tax incentive, special expensing of business assets, and
          qualification for private-activity bonds. The legislation also includes funding for two
          new EZs with the existing Empowerment Zone tax incentives. The cost of the tax
          incentives is $717 million. We will be working closely with the NEC, HUD, USDA,
          Treasury, and others on setting up the selection process.

       4. Brownfields Initiative

        Brownfields Tax Incentive: The reconciliation bill includes your proposed tax
         incentive for Brownfields. This incentive reduces costs by permitting clean-up costs to
         be deducted immediately for tax purposes. This will, in turn, encourage redevelopment
         ofthese areas. The tax incentive will be available for three years. The Treasury
         Department estimates that this $500 million tax incentive would allow $1.5 billion
         in expensing, leverage more than $6 billion for private sector cleanups nationwide,
         and allow redevelopment of 14,000 brownfields.


Possible Questions & Answers

Question:        What has your Administration done for urban communities generally?

Answer:          Many of our cities are experiencing the biggest economic resurgence since
                 World War II. In the 50 largest cities, the unemployment rate is down by a
                 third, and      more downtowns and neighborhoods are making a comeback.
                 And because of the disciplined and creative leadership of mayors, cities are in
                 strong fiscal health and booming with ideas for reform.

                 Instead of trying to impose ready-made solutions from Washington or ignore
                 cities' problems altogether, my Administration has tried to give local leaders the
                 tools and support they need to meet their challenges. That's why we've
                 supported initiatives like Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, the
                 Eamed Income Tax Credit, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, Community
                 Development Financial Institutions, and the flexible crime control and
                 prevention initiatives in the Crime Bill. That's why we've called for an
                 expansion of the Brownfields initiative to help put abandoned and contaminated
                 city properties back into productive use. And that's why we've fought for a $3 .
                 billion welfare-to-work initiative that will help our cities put former welfare
                 recipients to work.

                 All of these initiatives and more are tools that we've developed in tandem with

                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex텱ump Conversion
                  cities, and I think the record shows that they're making a difference.

    Question:      What have you done for Community Development Financial Institutions?

    Answer:          This Administration successfully fought for the creation of the CDFI Fund.
    The                         Fund already has made grants of 37.2 million and will announce
    another round                           of grants this Fall. We are also continuing to press
    for a major increase in the            CDFI program for next year, $125 million.
