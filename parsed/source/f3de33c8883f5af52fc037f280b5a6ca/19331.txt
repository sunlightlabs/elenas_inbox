                THE VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR
              LEGISLATION ON PAY EQUITY AND ADML~ISTRATION
                INITIATIVES TO COMBAT WAGE DISCRIMINATION
                                 April 2, 1998


Today the Vice President will announce the Administration's support for legislation, introduced
by Senator Daschle and Congresswoman DeLauro, to strengthcn the laws that prohibit wage
discrimination against women. The Vice President also will announce several Administration
initiatives aimed at reducing wage discrimination in the private sector and the federal
government.

Legislation to Improve Enforcement of Wage Discrimination Laws. The Vice President will
call on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen laws prohibiting wage discrimination. The
highlights of this legislation include:

      Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The bill amends the EPA to allow for
       full compensatory and punitive damages. Currently, the EPA provides only for
       liquidated damages and back-pay awards. This proposal would put gender-based wage
       discrimination on equal footing with wage discrimination based on race or ethnicity,
       for which uncapped compensatory and punitive damages are available.

      Non-retaliation Provision. Currently, employers can take action against employees who
       share information on pay. The Daschle bill amends the EPA to prohibit employers from
       penalizing employees for sharing information about their salaries with co-workers. The
       ability to share such information makes it easier for women to evaluate whether there is
       wage discrimination.

      Training, Research, Education, and Outreach. The bill requires the EEOC to
       provide training for its employees, subject to the availability of funding, on matters
       involving discrimination in the payment of wages. The bill also requires the
       Department of Labor (DOL) to undertake research in the area of sex-based pay
       disparities; provide information on means of eradicating such disparities; assist
       State and local information and educational programs; and convene a national
       summit to discuss and highlight the issue of sex-based pay disparities.

      Pay Equity Award. The bill establishes "The National Award for Pay Equity in the
       Workplace," to be administered by DOL, to recognize and promote the
       achievements of employers that have made strides to eliminate pay disparities.



Administration Actions to Enhance Compliance with Equal Pay Laws. The Vice President
also will announce a number of Administration initiatives including:
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

       Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) Between EEOC and DOL. EEOC and DOL
        are developing an MOU to train each other's staff on pay issues, to refer potential
        violations to the applicable EEOC or DOL office for appropriate action, and to permit the
        DOL's Office of Federal Contractor Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to serve as the
        EEOC's agent for purposes of seeking damages for wage discrimination.

       la-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Businesses and Employees. To help employers who
        would like to improve their pay and hiring practices, DOL will place on the Internet a
        la-step package that gives companies guidelines in determining whether they offer equal
        pay, hiring, and promotional opportunities. A similar checklist for employees, to help
        them determine if they are being paid equitably, will also be placed on the Internet.

       Self-Audit for Agencies. To make the federal government a "model" employer, federal
        agencies will conduct a self-audit, similar to the one described above, and use these
        results to monitor their efforts on equal pay.

       Increased Data Analysis on Pay Equity. DOL will publish an annual report on pay
        differences by gender. The purpose of this report will be to highlight the important issue
        of wage disparities.

       Guide to Recruitment and Retention of Women in the Federal Government. OPM is
        publishing a new Guide on Recruitment and Retention of Women in the Federal
        Government, which contains information to make agency managers aware of career
        opportunities for women and to provide guidance on recruitment and career development
        for women.

       Federal Contractor Best Practices. DOL will publicize successful programs of
        federal contractors by placing them on DOL's web site.
