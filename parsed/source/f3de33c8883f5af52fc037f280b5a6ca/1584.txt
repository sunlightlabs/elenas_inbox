                       Clinton Administration Urges FCC to Investigate
                              Hard Liquor Ads on TV and Radio
                                               April 1, 1997

     Announcement:
          Today, President Clinton announced that he was writing to Federal Communications
          Commission (FCC) Chairman Reed Hundt to 1) explore the effects _. on children in
          particular -- of the distilled liquor industry's decision to end its 50-year voluntary ban on
          broadcast advertising; and 2) determine what actions the FCC can take in response to the
          lifting of the ban.

     Background:
          In November 1996, the Distilled Spirits Council announced that it had ended its almost
           50-year voluntary practice of refraining from broadcast advertising.

           In his November 9, 1996 radio address, the President urged broadcasters to follow the
            example of the four major broadcast networks and continue to honor the ban to keep
            liquor ads off the air. The President also said to liquor companies, "You were right for
            the last 50 years when you didn't advertise on television; you're wrong to change your
            policy now. This is no time to tum back."

           Although the major networks and cable companies have so far refused to accept distilled
            spirits advertising, a few liquor manufacturers have been able to run some ads on
            television and radio since the announcement; other liquor companies are currently
            preparing large advertising campaigns.

           Chairman Hundt also has opposed any move toward liquor advertising. In December,
            he challenged broadcasters to refuse liquor advertising, and indicated that "government
            action" might be appropriate if the broadcasters did not do so.

           An FCC inquiry can supply the information needed to evaluate the nature and extent of
            the problem posed by broadcast liquor ads and to consider appropriate action.

     Alcohol Use by Youth
          Alcohol is the drug most often used by young people. Approximately one in four 10th
           grade students and one in three of 12th grade students report having had five or more
           drinks on at least one occasion during the last two weeks.

     Clinton Administration: Reducing Substance Abuse by Youth
           The President has pushed states to adopt a policy of zero-tolerance for teen drinking and
            driving or risk losing Federal highway funds.

           The President's fiscal year 1998 budget includes funding for a state demonstration
            program to drug-test teens before they receive their driver's licenses; it also provides
            incentives for states to fight drugged driving.
