 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS WIN ON THE BUDGET,
                    BUT THERE           Is STILL MORE WORK To Do
                                             October 14, 1998

Today's budget agreement represents a significant step forward for America, protecting the surplus until
Social Security is reformed, forging a bipartisan agreement on funding the International Monetary Fund,
and putting in place critical investments in education and training, from smaller class sizes to after-school
care, and from summer jobs to college mentoring. While the final budget agreement is a win for
President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Congressional Democrats, there is still more work to do to
prepare America for the 21st century. Unfortunately, Republicans blocked school modernization,
Patients Bill of Rights, comprehensive tobacco legislation, child care investments, and campaign finance
reform.

Saving Social Security First -- the President's commitment to Save Social Security First held the
line against several Republican efforts to drain the surplus.

Investing in Education and Training -- in the face of House Republican efforts to slash his education
budget by more than $2 billion, President Clinton delivered on his education agenda:
   _   More High-Quality Teachers With Smaller Class Sizes -- $1.1 billion for the first year of the
       President's new initiative to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades to a
       national average of 18. Through smaller classes this initiative will help recruit high-quality teachers
       and will insure that sutdents will receive more individual attention, a solid foundation in the basics,
       and greater discipline in the classroom.
   _   After School Programs -- $200 million to expand programs and serve nearly 500,000 children.

Much Work Still Left to Do:
In the waning days of the session, the President and Congressional Democrats prevailed in making critical
 investments to advance the President's comprehensive education agenda. Much work remains for the future
 because Republicans in Congress killed, at least for now, critical priorities, including:

    School Modernization -- Beginning with his State of the Union address, the President fought all year to
     modernize our schools. His fully paid for tax credits would have leverage nearly $22 billion in bonds to
     build and renovate schools. In the final days of the budget negotiations, Republicans in Congress
     refused to even meet on the critical issue of school construction.

    Patients Bill of Rights -- President Clinton repeatedly urged the Congress to pass a strong, enforceable
     patients' bill of rights that would assure Americans the quality health care they need.
         Congressional Republicans killed this year's effort to pass a Patients Bill of Rights.

    Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation -- This year, President Clinton made passage oflegislation to
     reduce youth smoking a top priority, in order to stop kids from smoking before they start through a
     significant price increase, measures to prevent tobacco companies from marketing to children, and critical
     public health prevention and education programs. Congressional Republicans opted to act as politicians
     instead of parents, and killed this year's effort to pass bipartisan comprehensive tobacco legislation to
     reduce youth smoking.

    Campaign Finance Reform            At the beginning of the year, the President made passage of
     bipartisan, comprehensive campaign finance reform a priority for his Administration. After months of
     delay, the House of Representatives overcame defenders of the status quo and passed the Shay-Meehan
     bill. However, the Senate Republicans killed this historic legislation.

    Child Care --       In his State of the Union, the President proposed an historic child care initiative to
     make child care better, safer and more affordable for America's working families. The President's
     proposal included $7.5 billion over 5 years for child care subsidies for low-income working families and
     tax credits to help 3 million working families pay for child care. The Republicans refused to support
     these critical investments.
