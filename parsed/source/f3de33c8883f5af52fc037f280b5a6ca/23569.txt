HEADLINE: Teens light up name brands Heavy advertisers get most smokers

BYLINE: Wendy Koch

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:
   WASHINGTON -- Most teen-age smokers continue to choose cigarette
brands that are heavily advertised, despite repeated tobacco industry
denials that it markets to kids, says a government study that
Vice President Gore will release today.

   The study finds that 88% of 12th-graders who smoke, 86% of 10th-grade
smokers and 82% of eighth-grade smokers choose Marlboro, Newport
or Camel -- brands that are among the most advertised.

   Marlboro ranks first overall, picked by three of every five teen
smokers, including girls. Newport is the top brand among African-American
teens. The menthol cigarette appears to be heavily marketed in
the black community.

   The 1998 findings closely resemble those of the last similar study,
done in 1993 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"



       But in the intervening five years, the industry has faced mounting
    pressure not to target kids. Under a settlement reached last year
    with 46 states, the industry can be taken to court if it does.
    It's now banned from using cartoon characters in its ads, and
    must take down the last of its billboards by April 23.

       Anti-smoking forces say the industry is still going after kids.
    "Our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook
    them on cigarettes," Gore says. Today, he'll talk to teens in
    Akron, Ohio, at one of 1,200 anti-smoking events nationwide marking
    the fourth annual "Kick Butts Day." Health and education groups
    are sponsoring the events, organized by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
    Kids.

       "The new study puts a tremendous onus on Phill.p Morris," the
    nation's largest tobacco company and maker of Marlboros, says
    Bill Novelli, the campaign's president.

       The company recently began a $ 100 million campaign of anti-smoking
    TV ads nationwide geared towards kids. Critics question, though,
    whether the industry is trying to woo public opinion and avoid
    pending anti-smoking efforts.

       Scott Williams, an industry spokesman, says tobacco companies
    don't target kids. He says that just because teens use advertised
    cigarettes does not mean they are targeted. "They will probably
    buy the market leader of any consumer product," he says.

       Last year, after the Senate killed a broad anti-smoking bill,
    President Clinton ordered annual government-funded studies of
    teen smoking.

       The new study was conducted by the University of Michigan's Institute
    for Social "Research, which does annual surveys on teen use of
    illicit drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. More than 7,000 teens who
    smoked at least one cigarette the previous month participated.
    The surveys show teen smoking rates dipped slightly in 1998.

               VICE PRESIDENT GORE UNVEILS NEW STUDY
    SHOWING THAT THREE CIGARETTE BRANDS DOMINATE YOUTH SMOKING

      Akron, OH - Vice President Gore unveiled today a new study showing that some of the
most heavily advertised cigarette brands -- Marlboro, Newport, and Camel-- are also the most
popular among current teen smokers.

       "Our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes," Vice
President Gore said today at a Kick Butts Day issues forum. "This study shows why Congress
should stand with our kids and stand up to the tobacco companies -let's act now to make sure
tobacco settlement funds are used to reduce youth smoking."

       The study, commissioned by the Department of Health and Human Services, examined
overall brand use and preference among teens. It found that approximately 88 percent of 12th
graders, 86 percent of 10th graders, and 82 percent of 8th graders who currently smoke
cigarettes use these three brands, among the most heavily advertised.

      In addition, the study found that:

            Marlboro, the dominant brand of the three, is preferred by an average of 60
            percent of current smokers across the three grade levels. Some 70 percent of
            white 12th graders who were current smokers in 1998 preferred Marlboro,
            and more than 60 percent of white students in both the 8th and 10th grades
            preferred this brand. This week, Advertising Age designated the Marlboro
            advertisement campaign the most successful ad campaign of the century.

            More than 80 percent of African-American 12th graders who were current
            smokers in 1998 preferred Newport -- a mentholated cigarette heavily
            marketed to the African-American community. More than 70 percent of
            African-Americans in both the 8th and 10th grades preferred Newport.

            In all three grades, Newport and Marlboro were just as popular among girls
            as among boys.




            The Vice President also highlighted new study released today by the Campaign for
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
Tobacco Free Kids that shows the children are still being targeted by cigarette ads.
Highlights from this study include that:

       Our children are being targeted by tobacco companies. Kids are two and a
       half times as likely as adults to have seen tobacco advertising in the past two
       weeks -- (75 percent of kids compared 31 percent of adults). Seventy-eight
       percent of kids say companies target them and want them to smoke.

       Young people are more likely to smoke the brands they have seen advertised.
        Sixty-nine percent of those who recall tobacco advertising say they have seen ads
       for Marlboro, the leading brand used by kids.

       Kids' perceptions of smoking influenced by what they see in the media. On
       average, the youth surveyed believe that two-thirds of adults smoke when, in
       reality, less than 25 percent do.

       The Vice President also highlighted other steps that the Administration is
taking to reduce teen smoking and urged the Congress to take action to pass critical
measures to protect our children. Taken together, these efforts will help cut youth
smoking in half within five years. These include:

       Requiring that money from the state tobacco settlement be spent on keeping
       kids from smoking. The Administration believes that any legislation that
       waives the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds must
       make a commitment from the states to fund such efforts. Without such a
       commitment, states won't have to spend a single penny of the $246 billion
       settlement to reduce youth smoking.

       Raising the price of cigarettes so fewer young people start to smoke. Public
       health experts agree that the single most effective way to cut youth smoking
       is to raise the price of cigarettes. The Administration is asking Congress to
       pass a $0.55 cigarette tax to build on increases already agreed to between the
       tobacco companies and the States and those passed by the Congress.

       Reaffirming the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) full authority to keep
       cigarettes out of the hands of children. The Vice President also reiterated the
       call on Congress to pass legislation to reaffirm the FDA's authority to
       regulate tobacco products in order to halt advertising targeted at children,
       and to curb minors' access to tobacco products. Only by affirming FDA's
       authority can Congress ensure that America's children are protected from
       the next generation of tobacco industry marketing.




       Supporting critical public health efforts to prevent youth smoking. The Vice
       President also urged the Congress to help support tobacco prevention
·                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
                programs in States and local communities by passing the Administration's
                proposal to double the funding for FDA's tobacco budget to $68 million and
                increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control's tobacco control efforts
                by one-third, from $74 to $101 million.

                Protecting farmers and farming communities. The Administration remains
                committed to protecting farmers and their communities, and we are
                encouraged that the states and industry were able to agree recently upon a $5
                billion package to compensate farmers. The Administration will work with
                all parties, as needed, to ensure the financial well-being of tobacco farmers,
                their families, and communities.

                 Kick Butts Day is a nationwide initiative designed to curb tobacco use among
         children and adolescents. Organized annually by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
         Kids, it involves young people nationwide staging a variety of anti-tobacco activities,
         such as testifying before State legislatures, exposing tobacco sales to minors, and
         dumping merchandise containing tobacco brand-name logos into garbage
         dumpsters. This year, for the fourth annual Kick Butts day, there are more than
         1,200 events being held around the country.
