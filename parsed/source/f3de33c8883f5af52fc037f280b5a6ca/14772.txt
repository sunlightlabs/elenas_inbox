                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

Criticisms that Disability Appointees May Raise:

     Welfare Reform -- The group would have preferred that the President not sign the welfare
      bill. They are concerned that disabled recipients are not exempt from or given special
      assistance in meeting the work requirements. People with severe disabilities are not
      subject to welfare reform because they are eligible for SSI. Therefore, the group is more
      concerned about those with mild or moderate disabilities. Some estimate that a very
      high proportion of AFDC recipients have some form of disability. Also, the group is
      also concerned about parents of children with disabilities being forced to work even
      though they can't afford child care.

      The Administration is working with states on these issues, and encouraging them to
      provide the more expensive child care disabled children often require. Also, the law
      prohibits states from cutting off assistance to parents of children under 6 who can't find
      appropriate child care.

     Children's SSI -- Because of tremendous growth in the children's SSI program and media
      reports that children were faking mental problems to get benefits, Congress proposed
      block granting and sweeping cuts to this program. The Administration successfully
      fought off these cuts, but eventually agreed to significant cuts. The Social Security
      Administration just issued regulations that will cut 135,000 children from the program.
      The appointees are disappointed in two things: that we did not fight these cuts harder, and
      that our regulations did not take a more liberal approach in issuing the regulations.

      We can take credit for defeating Republican plans to block grant children's SSI. As to
      SSA's recent regulation, SSA did not believe that a more liberal interpretation was legally
      possible.

     Medicaid -- The appointees are concerned that our per capita cap proposal could
      disadvantage people with disabilities, especially people with severe developmental
      disabilities, because their costs are far higher than average. Our proposal does address
      this problem by including a separate cap for the disabled. However, it is possible that a
      per capita cap would lead states to be reluctant to add services for very expensive long
      term care needs.

      In addition, the appointees are disappointed that we have not been able to move forward
      on a proposal for Medicaid "personal assistance" services. Many people with disabilities
      need assistance with activities of daily living, such as getting bathed and dressed, in order
      to work or live in the community, but health plans do not tend to pay for this service
      because it is not considered medical. (Many states have Medicaid ''waiver'' programs
      that provide these services, but the number of participants is capped.) The
      Administration's health care reform proposal (which was strongly supported by the
      disability community) would have partially addressed this issue by creating a new block
      grant. The appointees feel that it is time to move ahead on this issue again. However,
      OMB has major concerns about the cost implications. The President has made very
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


    sympathetic statements about the need for this program in public forums.

    A radical advocacy group called ADAPT is pushing this issue. The Administration has
    agreed to a meeting on this issue and others with the President and a range of external
    disability advocates, including ADAPT.

   Special Educationl"Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" -- Budget: The
    appointees are disappointed that our FY1998 budget includes "only" a 4% increase for
    special education spending. However, IDEA funding increased by an astounding 25% in
    the FYI 997 budget, so we felt that a 4% increase was appropriate for this year.
    (Members of Congress pushed through the 25% increase, not the Administration, but we
    can take credit for signing it.)

    Reauthorization: IDEA is also up for reauthorization, and Senator Lott is leading an
    collaborative process that the Administration is participating in to come to an agreement
    on a bill. IDEA is extremely important to this community, especially to parents of
    children of disabilities. IDEA includes civil rights protections that ensure that children
    with disabilities have the right to attend school -- something they did not have before
    IDEA was passed 20 years ago. In fact, Judy Heumann, the Administration's most
    prominent political appointee with a disability, was excluded from public schools for
    many years, prior to IDEA.

    The Administration has been extremely supportive of the disability community's position
    on IDEA. School boards and the unions view IDEA as an "unfunded mandate" that is a
    major drain on school budgets. They point out that federal funds support only 7-8% of
    the costs of special education, even though the original legislation foresaw federal
    payments covering 40% of costs. We have fought the "unfunded mandate" interpretation
    in a number of settings, instead stressing that IDEA is a civil rights law that shouldn't be
    weakened or tampered with.

    Discipline: The most contentious current IDEA issue is when and how schools can
    discipline students with disabilities. Critics charge that IDEA allows a double standard
    for students with disabilities by making it almost impossible for schools to remove them
    from the classroom or school, even if they are disruptive or violent. Parents respond that
    schools have long used the discipline issue as a smokescreen to try to remove these
    children just because they are different or harder to educate.

    The Administration supports modest and sensible measures to ensure that schools can
    maintain order, but we have totally supported the disability community on this issue --
    even to the point of allowing Secretary Riley to oppose a measure to expel disabled
    students who bring guns to school.

   Immigrants -- Disabled legal immigrants lose SSI benefits under welfare reform. We
    have proposed to ameliorate this, as part of our welfare "fix" package, by allowing legal
    immigrants who become disabled after entering the country to continue to receive SSI.
                                                              Hex-Dwnp Conversion


    The appointees are concerned about whether we are committed to this proposal. They
    may also be concerned that we left out those who were disabled upon entry to the U.S.

    Appointees may also be concerned about a regulation that the INS will issue shortly to
    waive the English and civics testing requirements of the naturalization process for legal
    immigrants with certain severe disabilities. They are concerned both that it has taken the
    INS over two years to issue these regulations, and that the final regs will not waive the
    oath of citizenship. An advocacy group is suing us over this regulation.

    We can point out that our proposed welfare fix package would address much of this
    problem by exempting legal immigrants disabled after entering the U.S. from the SSI
    cuts. However, the INS says the law does not allow them to waive the oath of
    citizenship. (yVe have not commented on whether we would waive it if we could.)

   Employment -- Estimates are that halfto two-thirds of people with disabilities are
    unemployed. The community argues that many unemployed people with disabilities
    want to work, but they face many barriers. The ADA is starting to improve this picture
    marginally, but there is a long way to go.

    The appointees have two concerns. First, as reflected in their draft executive order, they
    believe this problem is not viewed as a national priority by the Administration. They
    point to the fact that the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects this unemployment statistic on
    a very occasional basis. Second, they believe that the current federal Social Security
    system often acts as a disincentive to work. People on SSI or ssm benefits who want to
    work face the loss of Medicaid or Medicare, as well as cash benefits.

    We should point to our new initiative in the President's 1998 budget that addresses the
    second issue (see attached description). We can also agree to consider the draft
    executive order. However, potential solutions to the "disincentives" of the current Social
    Security system could be very expensive. (Note this week's GAO report and House
    hearing alleging that the SSI program is out of control because, among other concerns,
    SSA fails to drop people from the program quickly enough when they go back to work.)

   Housing -- The appointees may be concerned that the Administration has not been more
    proactive in enforcing housing civil rights laws. Also, they oppose past HUD efforts to
    segregate people with disabilities or require them to accept services as a condition for
    housing assistance (i.e., residential programs for the mentally ill or drug addicted). An
    advocacy group is suing HUD on all these issues.

    Secretary Cisneros reached out to groups very extensively on these issues and recently
    established an Office of Disability Policy in the Secretary's office that is staffed by a
    trusted appointee with a disability. He gets a lot of credit for this, but Secretary Cuomo
    is more of an unknown quantity to them.

   Transportation -- The concern here is probably that we should not weaken or delay the
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

requirements of the ADA for accessible transit systems, and that we should make funds
available to assist transit systems with compliance. We have been pretty strong on this
issue. State and local governments tend to view these requirements as unfunded
mandates, but we have argued that as a civil rights law the ADA can't be defined as an
unfunded mandate. The appointees give us credit for eliminating problematic ''unfunded
mandate" language in a report by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental
Relations last year.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
Information about the Appointees:

As the Chief of Staff knows, the appointees with disabilities have a number of sensitivities about
language and behavior pertaining to people with disabilities. They are leaders in the emerging
civil rights movement for this community, and see this movement as being perhaps 20 years
behind African Americans or women in terms of the degree of understanding and sensitivity of
the non-disabled community. They believe that denigrating language and behavior is still
widely tolerated in our society. In their view, disability is a natural part oflife and people with
disabilities should be viewed positively, rather than as victims, courageous, or pitied.

The term "people with disabilities" is preferred to "handicapped" or even "the disabled." They
often say that, in the spirit of "putting people first," you should look first at the person rather than
the disability. People "use" a wheelchair rather than "are in" a wheelchair -- or worse yet, "are
confined to" a wheelchair. In general, you should not offer assistance with a basic task such as
opening a door or getting seated unless the person appears unable to do so on his or her own.

The Administration's most prominent appointee with a disability is probably Judy Heumann,
who is Assistant Secretary at Education in charge of special education and vocational
rehabilitation. She played a major role in the development of the independent living movement,
which champions people with disabilities living in the community and with their families, and
has helped many people leave nursing homes. (The community is very much opposed to nursing
homes, viewing them as rarely or never appropriate for people with disabilities.) She is a very
constructive internal advocate.

Bob Williams, who is Commissioner of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities
(ADD), part ofHHS, speaks with a voice machine. When he wishes to speak, he often makes a
noise and begins punching into the machine. The etiquette is that other conversations should
continue until the artificial voice begins to speak, and then wait until the thought is expressed.
Bob is a very thoughtful individual who has also been a leader in the disability movment.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA, which governs special education) are viewed as virtually sacred by the community. The
Administration has been extremely strong in supporting these laws. In 1994, the community
was very fearful that the Republican takeover of Congress would lead to attempts to weaken
these laws. The threat never materialized into proposed legislation, but the community believes
it must be ever-vigilant in defending these laws.
