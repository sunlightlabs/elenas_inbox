                                                              July 9, 1998

         "Parents, the media, athletes, the government -- all of us must fulfill our obligation to protect our children from drugs. But
nothing we do will make a bit of difference unless young people also take responsibility for themselves. No one is too young to
understand that drugs are wrong. No one is too immature to take responsibility and say no to drugs. We will do everything we can to
help you -- but in the end, it is up to you. You can use drugs and risk your life, or you can reject drugs and reach for your dreams. As
the ad we saw today said: 'Any Questions? '"

                                                                                         President Bill Clinton
                                                                                         July 9, 1998

Today, President Clinton travels to Atlanta, where he is joined by Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of Health and Human
Services Donna Shalala, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy General Barry McCaffrey, and a bipartisan
delegation from Congress in launching the nationwide expansion of the largest ever national media campaign to target youth drug
use and educate young people and their parents about the dangers of drug use.

THE LARGEST TARGETED EFFORT EVER To TEACH YOUTH ABOUT DRUGS. The President's Anti-Drug Media Campaign is
designed to use the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs, This Campaign is designed to let teens
know -- when they tum on the television, listen to the radio, or access the Internet -- that drugs are dangerous, wrong, and can kill
you, Today's announcement will be reinforced by:

       A television "roadblock" that will air this evening -- where every network will show the same anti-drug advertisement this
        evening during the 9:00 p.m. (EDT) viewing hour. This advertisement will reach an estimated 85 million viewers. The
        roadblock advertisement will be supplemented by print ads in the nation's top 100 newspapers and radio ads in the top 100
        media markets.
       Local media buys to target specific drug problems in certain regions of the country. All new advertisements will provide
        the Campaign's clearinghouse number (1-800-288-7800), which will be staffed 24 hours a day and provide information on
        drug prevention. The campaign's new interactive web site (www.projectknow.com) will also be unveiled.
       Existing programs that started in 12 cities earlier this year. In January 1998, the Campaign began in 12 pilot cities. These
        cities have seen an increase in anti-drug awareness and a 300 percent increase in requests for anti-drug publications.

A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. The Campaign is more than just a series of advertisements. It is coupled with a
pUblic-private partnership that will generate a wide range of coordinated anti-drug activities with schools, civic organizations,
community anti-drug coalitions and others. The Campaign is also challenging media outlets to match, on a dollar for dollar basis,
the efforts put forth by the Campaign with time for youth drug prevention programming or related pro-bono ads.

BUILDING ON A RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. The President has made drug interdiction and prevention a top priority during
his term in office, including:

       The Largest Anti-Drug Budgets Ever. The President has consistently proposed the largest anti-drug budgets ever.
        Between 1996 and 1998, resources for drug control increased by 19%, and the President's budget for fiscal year
        1999 calls for an increase in funding for drug control, youth drug prevention efforts, domestic law enforcement, and
        interdiction.
       Developing a Comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy. The President has announced a comprehensive
        ten-year plan to reduce drug use and its consequences in the United States by 50%. This strategy will help reduce
        illegal drug use through law enforcement, prevention, treatment, interdiction and international cooperation.
        Strengthening and Expanding the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. President Clinton
        expanded the Drug-Free Schools Act into the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act of 1994, making violence
        prevention a key part of this program. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program provides support for violence and
drug    prevention programs to 97% of the nation's school districts. Schools use these funds to keep violence, drugs and
                 alcohol away from students and out of schools.
