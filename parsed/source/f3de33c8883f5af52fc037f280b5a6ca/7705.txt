                       The Commerce Committee Manager's Package
                         will Dramatically Reduce Youth Smoking


       The Commerce Committee manager's package contains significant improvements over
the underlying bill which will help to reduce significantly youth smoking and protect public
health. These improvements include:

Tougher Lookback Surcharges:

      The company-by-company surcharge of$1,000 per youth smoker will provide a
       significant incentive for tobacco companies to change their behavior and reduce sales to
       children. Unlike industry-wide surcharges, companies cannot pass company-specific
       surcharges onto price, because any price differential between companies will wreak havoc
       on their share of the adult market. In short, it affects their bottom line.

      Without a company-specific surcharge, any company can still make a profit by selling to
       kids. A $1,000 per youth smoker surcharge will force a company to surrender twice the
       lifetime profits it makes from addicting a teen in the first place.

      Any company that misses its targets by more than 20% will lose liability protections
       altogether. This will cause the companies real heartburn if they market to teens.

      Finally, the manager's package raises the cap on industry-wide lookback surcharges from
       $3.5 billion per year to $4 billion per year.                                .

Improved Liability Provisi~ms:

      By raising the annual liability cap from $6.5 to $8 billion, the manager's package better
       ensures that tobacco companics are held accountable for tobacco-related injuries.
       Additionally, the package removes liability protections for parent companies and
       affiliates, and allows plaintiffs claiming injury from disease to use evidence of addiction
       in their lawsuit.

Enhanced Environmental Tobacco Smoke Protections:

      States would only be allowed to opt-out of the national environmental tobacco smoke
       standard if the state is able to demonstrate to QSHA that it has an ETS standard at least as
       protective of public health as the federal standard.

Elimates Antitrust Exemption:

      The blanket antitrust exemption contained in the underlying bill is not necessary to
       achieve the goals of the legislation and may have anticompetitive effects.

Stronger Anti-Smuggling Provisions:

     Key provisions will minimize smuggling by creating a system similar to the one that has
      successfully been in place for alcoholic beverage for over sixty years. This system
      would create a "closed distribution system" for tobacco products so that only licensed
      entities can sell or buy products, clearly brand packages for export to prevent them from
      being diverted, and establishes and enforces penalties and other actions for violations.
      States would also have the resources and flexibility they need to set up their own
      licensing systems for retailers.

Key Spending Language:

     The manager's package contains key provisions to fund important public health programs
      (including smoking cessation, prevention and counteradvertising), health research and
      assistance for farmers. It also provides funding to states to be used for a variety of
      programs, including child care and class size reduction.
