Announcement

     Today, President Clinton announced that the Justice Department will: 1) provide New
      York City with a $120 million grant to fund 1,600 additional police officers; and 2)
      provide another 620 law enforcement agencies with $118 million in grants to fund an
      additional 1,700 police officers. President Clinton's COPS Initiative has now helped
      fund more than 70,000 police officers in communities across the country.

Making Our Streets Safe

     100,000 More Police. In 1992, President Clinton pledged to help cities hire 100,000
      more police officers and to expand community policing. He proposed and fought
      for a nearly'$9 billion COPS Initiative as part of the 1994 Crime Act. With today's
      announcement, the COPS Initiative will have helped to fund over 70,000 additional
      police officers in more than 10,000 cities. Funding for the President's goal of
      100,000 officers remains a protected priority in the 1997 Balanced Budget
      Agreement.

     Lowest Crime Rates in 25 years. Crime rates have dropped for five years in a row, to
      their lowest levels in 25 years. Since 1993, violent crime has dropped 16% -- and the
      murder rate has plummeted by more than 20%. In city after city, community policing is
      playing a key role in driving down the crime rates.

     New York City: A National Model. Nowhere has the President's COPS Initiative
      made a bigger difference than in New York City. To date, COPS has provided New
      York City with more than $280 million to hire and redeploy over 4,200 police officers,
      and crime rates have dropped dramatically,

A Record o(Success in Fighting Crime

     Tough, Smart Anti-Crime Strategy. President Clinton has worked closely with police,
      prosecutors and community leaders to give communities the tools they need to cut crime.
      He worked to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by banning 19 deadly assault
      weapons, and preventing more than 300,000 fugitives and felons from purchasing guns
      through Brady background checks. He fought for tougher penalties for violent and sex
      offenders, and more prisons to incarcerate them. And he has pushed to keep schools.
      open late, so that kids can be supervised during the high-crime hours after class.
