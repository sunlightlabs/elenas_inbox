     TODAY, THE LABOR DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE :{g ~

           UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN TO 4.7 PERCENT -- ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 24 YEARS. The
            October unemployment rate was 4.7 -- its lowest level since 1973. The unemployment rate has
            been below 6 for 38 consecutive months and at or below 5 for 7 months now with no signs of
            inflationary pressures. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5 . [Source: BLS.]

           280,000 NEW JOBS LAST MONTH -- 13.5 MILLION NEW JOBS UNDER PRESIDENT
            CLINTON. During the Clinton Administration, the economy has added 13.5 million new jobs --
            a faster annual rate of job growth (2.5 percent per year) than any Republican Administration since
            the Roaring 1920s. The economy has added 2.8 million jobs over the past year. [Source: Based on data
            from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]


           REAL WAGES RISING AGAiN. After stagnating or declining for years, real wages are rising
            again. Over the past 12 months, wages have risen 4.2 percent -- that is far faster than the 2.2
            percent inflation rate over the past year. [Source: BLS]

           STRONG PRIVATE-SECTOR JOB GROWTH Last month, the economy added 282,000
            private-sector jobs. Since President Clinton took office, the private sector of the economy has
            added 12.5 million new jobs -- with 2.5 million jobs added in the past year. Under President
            Clinton, 93 percent of the 13.5 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private
            sector -- that's a higher percentage than any Administration since Tmman. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]

           TURNING THE CORNER IN BASIC AMERICAN INDUSTRIES. After losing 667,000 jobs in
            construction during the previous four years, 1.1 million new construction jobs have been added
            since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S
            Truman was President. After losing 35,000 jobs in the auto industry during the Bush years, we
            have 136,000 new auto jobs since President Clinton took office. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current

     WITH AMERICA'S JOBS MACHINE RUNNING AT FULL SPEED, WE MUST PRESS AHEAD
     WITH THE PRESIDENT'S THREE-PART ECONOMIC STRATEGY OF OPENING FOREIGN
     MARKETS, INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE, AND CUTTING THE DEFICIT.

           CONGRESS MUST PASS FAST TRACK. The House of Representatives will vote on whether
            or not to provide the President "fast-track" trading authority -- the same authority every President
            since Ford has had. Today's numbers show that President Clinton's three-part economic strategy
            is working. Exports are up more than 50 percent since President Clinton took office, helping to
            create millions of high-paying jobs. To continue to keep America's economy strong, we need to
            continue to open markets abroad. A vote against fast track is a vote against high-paying export
