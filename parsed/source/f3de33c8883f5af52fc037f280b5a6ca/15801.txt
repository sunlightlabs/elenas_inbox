    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:                          Jack Gibbons
                                   Assistant to the President for Science and Technology

                                   Elena Kagan
                                   Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

    SUBJECT:                       Cloning Policy Decisions

    This memo summarizes (1) the final version of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission
    (NBAC) cloning report completed yesterday, and (2) the cloning legislation we have prepared for
    you to submit to Congress on Monday_ The memo address two issues about the legislation we
    would like you to focus on: (1) whether to prohibit the production of embryos (as well as human
    beings) through cloning, and (2) whether to sunset the prohibition on cloning after 5 years.

    NBAC's Findings and Recommendations

    In its final report NBAC states that at this time it is morally unacceptable for anyone to attempt to
    create a child using the technology that created Dolly the sheep (so-called somatic cell nuclear
    transfer technology). NBAC also concludes that the cloning of DNA, cells, and tissues, and the
    cloning of animals, are scientifically important and not ethically problematic. NBAC chose not
    to address at all the cloning of embryos for research purposes. NBAC calls for:

           Carefully-worded legislation that prohibits somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a child
           (without impeding important cloning research on DNA, cells, and animals), sunsets in 3-5
           years, and provides for further review by an advisory body prior to the sunset date;
           Continuing your moratorium on the use of federal funds for cloning human beings while
           the proposed legislation is pending;
           Calling on all scientists and clinicians to adhere to the voluntary moratorium; and
           Working with other countries to enforce common aspects of cloning restrictions.

    Proposed Legislation

    The legislation you will announce tomorrow, as currently written:

           Prohibits the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer with the intent of introducing the product
           into a woman's womb or in any other way creating a human being;
           Gives the Attorney General authority to seek injunctive relief, impose civil fines up to
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion       .

       $250,000 or twice the profit from a violation of the Act (whichever is greater), and seize
       any and all property used in violating the Act (including entire laboratories);
       Sunsets the prohibition on cloning 5 years from the date of enactment; and
       Directs the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to report to you prior to the sunset
       date on the advisability of continuing the prohibition.

Key Legislative Issues

1. Embryo Research

NBAC's proposed legislation -- and, as currently drafted, your bill -- would not ban the creation
of cloned embryos for research purposes. NBAC simply did not evaluate the ethics or
scientific benefits of this activity; it focused exclusively on the use of cloning techniques to
create an embryo that would then be implanted in a woman's uterus and brought to term. NBAC
reasoned that other entities (including a 1994 Nlli panel) already have discussed extensively the
creation of embryos for research purposes, and the use of cloning technology in this context
raises no distinct ethical issues. By contrast, the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology
to create a child raises a host of new and different ethical issues relating to safety, individuality,
and family

You took action In 1994 to restrict embryo research by banning the use ofNlli funds to create
embryos for research purposes (the Nlli panel had recommended permitting the funding of
research on embryos in very limited circumstances). You also signed a spending bill that
included a prohibition on the use of HHS funds for embryo research. But your budget
submissions for FY97 and FY98 stated in a footnote that the Administration did not support
addressing this issue in legislation. Nor have you ever indicated support for extending the
current restriction to privately funded embryo research.

The right-to-life community already has criticized NBAC for not recommending a ban on
creating cloned embryos. But there are good reasons for not going so far. There is no moral
rationale for treating embryos created through cloning differently from embryos developed
through other means (e.g. in vitro fertilization) when embryos are used solely for research.
Prohibiting the creation of embryos for research using private funds could halt important research
on infertility and possibly other medical conditions and would provoke strong opposition form
the scientific and fertility communities. In short, it is a controversial step that merits further
consideration. We therefore recommend that you limit the scope of the legislation you submit to
Congress on Monday to the issue the Commission addressed. If asked about your position on
embryo research, you could note that it is an important but separate question and reiterate your
position that no federal funds should be used to create embryos for research purposes.

2.     Sunset Provision

NBAC recommends strongly that any legislative prohibition on cloning include a sunset clause to
ensure that Congress review the issue after a specified period of time.
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

Whether a sunset provision makes sense depends in part on why a cloning ban is appropriate.
For those who believe cloning is unethical primarily because of safety concerns, a sunset is
necessary because time may mitigate those concerns. But for those who believe that cloning is
inherently morally wrong, a sunset provision may seern wrong because time cannot lessen the
problem. If you propose a sunset provision, you will subject yourself to criticism on this score.
It is important to understand, however, that some who share your view that cloning is inherently
morally wrong nonetheless favor a sunset provision. They reason that: (1) a sunset provision
provides a strong incentive for Congress and the Administration to renew the national debate on
cloning within several years, ensuring continued attention to the ethical questions; (2) there has
been little time to fully consider the moral issues, and it is possible that convictions may evolve;
and (3) there is a high probability that Congress will simply get the legislative language wrong
the first time around, given our limited understanding of the science, the difficulty of defining
terms, and the vagaries of the legislative process.

As an alternative to proposing a sunset provision, you could propose legislation that provides for
review by NBAC in 4 Y2 years but does not sunset the ban. This approach would shift the burden
of proof to those who want to lift the ban, since Congress would have to act affirmatively to
effect change. Jack Gibbons, Harold Varmus, and the scientific and biotechnology communities
oppose this modification to your draft legislation. The Vice President prefers this modified
approach.
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

        I am pleased to transmit today for immediate consideration and prompt enactment the
"Cloning Prohibition Act of 1997." This legislative proposal would prohibit any attempt to
create a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology, the method that was used to
create Dolly the sheep. This proposal will also provide for further review of the ethical and
scientific issues associated with the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer in human beings.

        Following the February report that a sheep had been successfully cloned using a new
technique, I requested my National Bioethics Advisory Commission to examine the ethical and
legal implications of applying the same cloning technology to human beings. The Commission
concluded that at this time "it is morally unacceptable for anyone in the public or private sector,
whether in a research or clinical setting, to attempt to create a child using somatic cell nuclear
transfer cloning" and recommended that Federal legislation be enacted to prohibit such activities.
 I agree with the Commission's conclusion and am transmitting this legislative proposal to
implement its recommendation.

         Various forms of cloning technology have been used for decades resulting in important
biomedical and agricultural advances. Genes, cells, tissues, and even whole plants and animals
have been cloned to develop new therapies for treating such disorders as cancer, diabetes, and
cystic fibrosis. Cloning technology also holds promise for producing replacement skin,
cartilage, or bone tissue for burn or accident victims, and nerve tissue to treat spinal cord injury.
Therefore, nothing in the "Cloning Prohibition Act of 1997" restricts activities in other areas of
biomedical and agricultural research that involve: (1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or
other cloning technologies to clone molecules, DNA, cells, and tissues; or (2) the use of somatic
cell nuclear transfer techniques to create animals.

        The Commission recommended that such legislation provide for further review of the
state of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology and the ethical and social issues attendant to its
potential use to create human beings. My legislative proposal would implement this
recommendation and assign responsibility for the review, to be completed in the fifth year after
passage of the legislation, to the National Bioethics Advisory Commission.

       I urge the Congress to give this legislation prompt and favorable consideration.

                                                              WILLIAM J. CLINTON

THE WHITE HOUSE
     June 9, 1997
                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                          FACT SHEET                              Hex-Dump Conversion


The President today transmitted to the Congress the "Cloning Prohibition Act of 1997." This
legislative proposal would implement the key recommendation of the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission for legislation to prohibit any attempt to create a human being using
somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.

The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) Report

President Clinton today accepted the NBAC's report on the possible cloning of human
beings. In February, following reports of the successful cloning of a sheep, the President asked
the NBAC to review the profound ethical issues raised by the possible cloning of human beings.
Today, Dr. Harold Shapiro, Chair of the Commission and President pfPrinceton University, formally
presented the report to the President.

The Commission found unanimously that it is morally unacceptable for anyone to attempt
to create a child with the technology used to created Dolly the sheep. The NBAC reported
that attempting to create a child using so-called somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning would pose
great risks to the child and raise other ethical issues needing further discussion. The NBAC
called for a moratorium on the use of the technique in humans.

The Commission also found that the new technology may have many agricultural and
medical benefits, including the development of medicines, therapies for diseases such as cancer,
cystic fibrosis, and diabetes, and prospects for repair and regeneration of human tissues. The
NBAC concluded that the cloning of DNA, cells, tissues, and non-human animals -- using
somatic cell nuclear transfer and other cloning techniques -- is not ethically problematic when
conducted in compliance with existing regulations and guidelines.

Cloning Prohibition Act of 1997

Acting on the Commission's key recommendation, President Clinton announced legislation
banning the use ofthe new technology to clone human beings. Consistent with the NBAC's
recommendation, the President's legislative proposal prohibits [for five years?] the use of
somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a human being and directs the NBAC to report to the
President in four and a half years on whether to continue the ban. The proposal is carefully
worded to ensure that it will not interfere with beneficial biomedical and agricultural activities.

Further Actions By The President

As recommended by the NBAC, President Clinton today also:

·      Reaffirmed that no Federal funds will be used to clone human beings. The President
       stated that the prohibition he put in place in March will remain in effect while his
       proposed legislation is pending.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

·   Urged privately funded scientists and clinicians to adhere to the voluntary
    moratorium he called for in March. The President asked these professionals to work
    through their societies and associations to ensure that all adhere to the current voluntary
    ban while his proposed legislation is pending_

·   Pledged to work with other countries to enforce the prohibition. Several other
    countries, including Great Britain, Denmark, Germany, Australia, and Spain, have banned
    human cloning.
