                          PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                        NATIONAL GOVERNOR'S ASSOCIATION
                               LAS VEGAS, NEVADA
                                  JULY 28,1997

         Acknowledgments: Governor Miller -- thank you for your leadership ofthe NGA over
the past year. Hillary and I are also grateful to you for your leadership in the area of early
childhood development, an issue that we care so much about; Gov. Voinovich--
congratulations on assuming the NGA chairmanship; and Gov. Carper -- congratulations on
becoming vice chairman; Sec. Riley; Mickey Ibarra, our new director of intergovernmental
affairs; Fred Duval, deputy director for governors.

        I am glad to be here in the great city of Las Vegas. Two days ago I was at Lake Tahoe.
Governor Miller, you've got a beautiful state. This is the fifth year I have spoken to the NGA as
President, and each year we have seen progress in strengthening the growing partnership between
the White House and the state house. When I first took office in 1993, I had a clear vision of
what it would take to prepare our country for the vast opportunities and challenges of the 21 st
century. I believed then, as I believe now, that we must be committed to the pursuit of
opportunity for all, responsibility from all, in a community of all Americans.

        That means that, above all, we must work together. The American people made it clear
some time ago that they wanted a shift in the balance of power between Washington and the
states. They wanted a smaller, more efficient federal government -- one that did not try to solve
all problems, but set national priorities and gave people the tools to make the most of their own
lives. They wanted a federal government that cost less and worked better. And we have given
them that.

         We all know that the best way to limit big government in Washington is to have better
government in the states. Thanks to you, that is what we are getting. More and more of what
used to be run out of Washington has now been turned over to you -- and you are proving that
you are up to the challenge. We have also asked the American people to take a more active role
in this new partnership -- calling for greater personal responsibility and a renewed commitment
to citizen service. And that too is having a positive impact.

       Just look at what we have accomplished together. In 1993, we put in place a new
economic approach -- reducing the deficit to create the conditions for growth; investing in the
education and skills of our people so all Americans can reap the rewards of prosperity; and an
aggressive drive to open foreign markets to our goods and services. We now have the strongest
economy in a generation: the deficit is down 77%; 12.5 million new jobs; unemployment is the
lowest since 1973; we have the biggest drop in income inequality and the lowest inflation in 30
years. All this was made possible by the combined efforts of all of us in this room and citizens
from Maine to Hawaii.



                                                1
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

        Our country is in strong shape. We are well prepared for the 21 st century. But, today I
want to talk about two things we must do to keep us on the right track. First, we must continue
to move forward on welfare reform so that the problem of generational dependency does not
become the legacy of this century and follow us into the next. And second, we must make sure
we give our children the world's best education -- one that challenges them to achieve at the
highest standards so they will have the skills and confidence to take advantage of the vast
opportunities of the 21st century.

        Fixing our broken welfare system has been one of the top priorities of my presidency.
Since I took office, we granted waivers to 43 states to help you launch welfare reform
experiments that emphasize work and personal responsibility. And last year we took the bold
step of finally ending welfare as we know it. We began to transform the system -- to make
welfare a second chance, not a way oflife, and to elevate our values of family and work and
responsibility. A year ago, I signed welfare reform into law to make tough work requirements,
time limits and parental responsibility the law of the land. There was a lot of debate at the time
over whether this bold experiment would work. We still have more to do. But today, the old
debate is over: welfare reform works.

         There are 3 million fewer people on welfare than the day I took office and a remarkable
1.2 million fewer since I signed welfare reform into law. Nine states have cut their rolls by more
than 40% in the last four years. Wisconsin and Wyoming have cut their caseloads in half. This
is the largest decrease in the welfare rolls in history, giving us the lowest percentage of the
population on welfare since 1970.

        But even more impressive than these numbers is the pride that comes from a mother
being able to tell her children she now has a job, or a community being able to come together to
create jobs and hire and train people on welfare, or a child who now has access to safe, healthy,
good quality day care because her state chose wisely to invest in child care.

       And we should also be proud of the fact that we are on course to fix the things we said
we were going to fix. In the balanced budget agreement, we got commitments to restore the
most egregious cuts in aid to legal immigrants and to restore $1.5 billion for food stamps. State
and local officials were central to this battle for fairness. You agreed with us that those
provisions represented a cost-shift to states that would have undermined our efforts at true
reform. And I thank you for that.

        So, there is much that we should be proud of. But, there is also much more to do.
Welfare reform is not a fait accompli, but a work in progress. You asked to be cut loose from
federal bureaucratic strings that tied your hands and impeded the pace of reform -- and we did
that. But we must never forget, with flexibility comes responsibility. When I signed that bill
into law, I did not sign away my responsibility to make sure it achieved its stated purpose of
moving people from welfare to work. States now have both the added power and the added
responsibility for making that a reality.


                                                2
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

        So, today, nearly one year after the enactment of welfare reform, I want to take a
hard look at how we are doing - to highlight our successes, point out our shortcomings and
to challenge everyone involved -- welfare recipients, the business community, the religious
community, civic and non-profit organizations, state legislatures, local officials and
governors -- to redouble our efforts so that we can meet our goal of moving a million people
from welfare to work by the year 2000.

       We need to take a look at what states are doing in four areas that are critical to moving
people off welfare: jobs, child care, transportation and child support.

       The first thing we need to do is assess how well we are doing in creating jobs that will
move people from welfare to work. As I have said all along, if we are going to require people to
work we have to provide them with the opportunity to work. Nearly all state welfare-to-work
programs include the traditional elements of job search, training, education, community work
experience and placement in unsubsidized jobs. But now, 36 states are doing what I have
encouraged every state to do -- use welfare checks to subsidize private jobs.

         We made sure that the balanced budget agreement we reached with Congress included $3
billion in welfare-to-work funds to help create the jobs to move people from welfare to work. I
also secured a commitment from congressional leaders to give private employers tax incentives·
to hire long-term welfare recipients. Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are among those states
that is already doing this. Let me say, I believe that every one of those new workers should earn
at least the minimum wage and receive the protections of existing employment laws that other
workers enjoy.

        Our Welfare-to-Work partnership is bringing together CEOs of small and large
companies committed to hiring people off welfare. I want to thank Governors Tommy
Thompson and Tom Carper for co-chairing the Partnership's Advisory Council. I urge all of
you to become members and I challenge you to create similar public/private partnerships in your
own states. North Carolina is among a growing list of states that are already doing quite well in
this area.

        Here in Las Vegas, the state and the hotel/casino industry have been working closely to
create training programs and hire welfare recipients. MGM Grand Hotel has hired over 1000
welfare recipients during the past several years. And the state has set a goal for new casinos to
set aside 10 percent of all positions for fonner welfare recipients.                    .

         Child care is a critical support for families moving from welfare to work and low income
families trying desperately to make ends meet. Parents need child care so they can work without
worrying and children need quality child care so they can leam and grow. We simply cannot
expect parents to go to work if they have nowhere to send their children during the day. We
would not think of imposing that dilemma on our families -- and we should not do that to
families struggling to make the move to independence. That is why I made sure the welfare


                                                3
                                                                              Hex·Dump Conversion

refonn bill added $4 billion more in child care assistance. Now, you must do your part.
        I am pleased to report that efforts to expand child care are widespread. Because of the
additional $4 billion we secured in the welfare law, states are now receiving more federal dollars.
  About half the states are increasing their spending beyond what is needed to receive all of their
 new federal funds. Some states, including Florida and Wisconsin are adding quite a bit more.
And some states are creating seamless child care systems which provide subsidies for all workers
below a certain income, whether they have been on welfare or not. That is a model that should
be followed throughout the country. So, I challenge every state to make a significant investment
in child care.

        The First Lady and I are convinced that the availability of quality, affordable child care
for all who need it, is the next great frontier we have to cross to truly enable American families to
reconcile the demands of work and home. That is why on October 23rd, we will convene the
first-ever White House Conference on Child Care to discuss the strengths and weaknesses ofthe
present system so we can find ways to achieve our goal.

       The third thing we ought to take a look at is how well we are doing in making sure there
is adequate transportation to get those moving from welfare to work to jobs. which often are
outside their neighborhoods.

       One of the biggest barriers facing people -- in cities and in rural areas -- who move from
welfare to work is finding transportation to get to jobs, training programs and day care centers.
Today, only about 6 percent of those on welfare have cars. In many big cities, no matter how
long people sit on a public bus, they can't reach half the entry level jobs. At the same time,
businesses in the suburbs need new workers. Our challenge is to make sure that lack of
transportation is not an obstacle to getting people who want to work to jobs where they are
needed. That is why I urge the Congress to pass a transportation bill that includes my proposal
for $600 million to help states and local communities devise transportation strategies to move
people from welfare to work.

         Some communities and states have already started to address the transportation
challenges of welfare refonn. Kentucky's "Empower Kentucky" initiative combines the
resources offour cabinet offices in a free transportation brokerage system that will assure
transportation is available in all areas of the state. Michigan's "Project Zero" provides
transportation in its effort to put every able-bodied welfare recipient to work. And in
Wisconsin, where only 3.5 percent of welfare recipients own cars, the state's "Job Ride"
initiative is vanpooling thousands of central city workers to suburban jobs. Other states are
devoting a portion of their welfare block grant funds to transportation. We need this kind of
innovation in more states. And we need Congress to support these types of efforts in the ISTEA
bill.

        Fourth. we know that child support can be the difference between welfare and
self-sufficiency. Every child has two parents and they are entitled to the support of two parents.


                                                 4
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

We have made remarkable progress in this area -- increasing child support collections by 50%
from 1992 to 1996. And we made sure the welfare law included tough new measures to help
states track deadbeat parents across state lines. To date, however, not all states have taken all the
steps to put these measures in place. For those states that are lagging behind, this is one of the
critical steps in welfare reform. For the sake of the law and the children, it cannot wait. Work
with your legislatures to get it done. And put in place no-nonsense state-wide child support
collection systems that work for every child and every family.

       Finally, let me add a caution. Welfare reform will only work if states continue to use the
savings they are now seeing to move more people into the workforce -- those savings should not
be diverted to other uses.

        Together, we have lowered the welfare rolls by over 3 million people in four-and-a-half
years. That is a great accomplishment. But we all know that many of the people left on the
welfare rolls are those with the least skills and experience, who may require extra help in getting
into the workforce. That is why I believe debates in some state Capitols about how to divert
welfare savings away from welfare reform to other uses are just plain wrong. We should invest
those savings to put even more people to work. Cutting back on child care or financing a big tax
cut defy the spirit of the law. I challenge every state to follow Maryland's lead -- take the
money you save from lowering your caseloads and use it for the child care, transportation, and
training that people need to move from welfare to work.

       It is clear: as we approach the first anniversary of this bill, welfare reform is working.
But, we must not rest on this early success. We still have a ways to go to make the permanent
underclass a thing of the past. I know of the good work you all doing and I urge all of you to
intensify your efforts to make sure we uphold our end of the bargain and our most cherished
values of work, family, and responsibility.

        I want to ask for your help in one other area -- education.· As you know, the centerpiece
of my comprehensive plan for improving American education -- and the most important thing we
can do to give our children the world class education they deserve -- is an insistence on high
standards. Not federal standards, but national standards of excellence that every child can meet.


       In my State of the Union, I challenged every state to adopt these high standards, and by
1999 to test every 4th grader i~ reading and every 8th grader in math to make sure these
standards are met. Since I issued that call, governors and education leaders in six states have
agreed to participate in these tests. I want to thank North Carolina, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Kentucky and West Virginia, along with the Department of Defense schools all over
the world for stepping up to this challenge.

      Last week, Secretary Riley and I attended a meeting of the National Association of
Elementary School Principals in Washington, where we announced that fifteen of our largest


                                                  5
                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

     school districts -- including the schools in six ofthe seven largest cities in America have
     committed to adopt national standards and participate in this testing program. That means that
     now 8.6 million children -- one out of every 5 public schoolchildren in America -- will be held to
     world class educational standards in the basics. So, we are making progress. But we need more
     states to join this effort. For more than a decade, govemors have been the leaders in educational
     reform. You have been leading the effort to raise standards in your states. But as long as each
     state is doing this on its own, your students will not know if they are meeting the requirements of
     the global economy. They deserve better than that -- and we have a responsibility to give it to
     them.

             This is not about the federal government taking over education, it is about every one of us
     doing all we can to inspire our children to reach for and realize their highest potential. We owe
     it to our children to set high standards and to measure how well they are doing -- not just against
     your state's expectations, but against the requirements they must meet throughout the country
     and the world. And we have to take whatever steps are needed to ensure that all our kids can
     meet these standards. So, today I urge every governor who has not stepped up to this challenge
     to do so. It is the most important thing we can do to prepare our children to succeed in the
     century ahead.

              Welfare reform and education reform -- both are state responsibilities, but national
     priorities. And both are critical to making sure America is strong and growing into the next
     century. I want to thank all of you for your leadership on these two important fronts. But I want
     to caution you that nothing we do in these areas will matter unless we come together as One
     America..

            Last month, in San Diego, I issued a call for all our citizens to begin a great national
     dialogue about the issue of race. I asked us to focus on how we can enter the next century as the
      most successful multiracial, multi ethnic, multireligious democracy the world has ever known.
     And I was pleased that two former govemors -- Thomas Kean of New Jersey and William Winter
     of Mississippi -- agreed to serve on my advisory board.

              You are already seeing the great demographic shift that is literally changing the face of
     America. Today, Hawaii is the only state in America that has no majority race. Within four
     years, California will also have no majority race. And within 30 years, there will be no majority
     race in this country. We know what we will look like in a generation -- the question before us
     today, is what will we be like. Can we respect and celebrate our differences, while uniting
     around a common set of values? Can we open our minds and hearts to ensure that all our
     citizens of every race, ethnic background and income level, have an equal chance to make the
     most of their lives?
     How we answer those questions will determine what kind of a nation we will be in the next
