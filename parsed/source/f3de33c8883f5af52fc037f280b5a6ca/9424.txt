                     IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                                  July 30, 1998

Mr. BENNETT (by request) (for himself, Mr. DODD, Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr. KOHL,
and Mr.

the Committee on the
Judiciary

                               September 17, 1998

Reported by Mr. HATCH, with an amendment and an amendment to the title


                                     A BILL

To encourage the disclosure and exchange of information about computer
processing problems and
related matters in connection with the transition to the year 2000.

     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of
     America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as the 'Year 2000 Information and Readiness
Disclosure Act' .

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

     (a) FINDINGS- Congress finds the following:

             (1) (A) At least thousands but possibly millions of information
technology
             computer systems, software programs, and semiconductors are not
capable of
          recognizing certain dates in 1999 and after December 31, 1999,
and will read
          dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if those dates
represent the year 1900 or
          thereafter or will fail to process those dates.

           (B) The problem described in subparagraph (A) and resulting
failures could
          incapacitate systems that are essential to the functioning of
markets, commerce,
          consumer products, utilities, government, and safety and defense
systems, in the
          United States and throughout the world.

             (C) Reprogramming or replacing affected systems before the
problem
          incapacitates essential systems is a matter of national and
global interest.

             (2) The prompt, candid, and thorough disclosure and exchange of


information
           related to year 2000 readiness of entities, products, and
services--

                  (A) would greatly enhance the ability of public and private
entities to
                  improve their year 2000 readiness; and

                  (B) is therefore a matter of national importance and a
vital factor in
                  minimizing any potential year 2000 related disruption to
the Nation's
                  economic well-being and security.

          (3) Concern about the potential for legal liability associated
with the disclosure
          and exchange of year 2000 readiness information is impeding the
disclosure and
          exchange of such information.

          (4) The capability to freely disseminate and exchange
information relating to year
          2000 readiness, solutions, test practices and test results, with
the public and other
          entities without undue concern about litigation is critical to
the ability of public
          and private entities to address year 2000 needs in a timely
manner.

          (5) The national interest will be served by uniform legal
standards in connection
          with the disclosure and exchange of year 2000 readiness
information that will
          promote disclosures and exchanges of such information in a
timely fashion.

      (b) PURPOSES- Based upon the powers contained in article I, section
8, clause 3 of the
     Constitution of the United States, the purposes of this Act are--

          (1) to promote the free disclosure and exchange of information
related to year
          2000 readiness;

           (2) to assist consumers, small businesses, and local governments
in effectively and
          rapidly responding to year 2000 problems; and

           (3) to lessen burdens on interstate commerce by establishing
certain uniform legal
          principles in connection with the disclosure and exchange of
information related
          to year 2000 readiness.
