MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT:               UPDATE ON SELECTED EDUCA nON INITIATIVES

This memo provides you with a detailed update on your national standards and testing initiative
and a brief update on your charter schools initiative, the two aspects of you Call to Action most
directly framed as challenges to states. In the near future we will provide you with additional
updates, focused on you budget-related education initiatives and on other legislative initiatives.

1. NATIONAL STANDARDS AND TESTS
 Our objective is to have 40+ states participate in the initial 1999 administration of the national
tests. To reach this objective, we are working on several interrelated fronts:

Developing the Tests: By the end of April, the Education Department will release a Request for
Proposals (RFP) for the development of the 4th grade reading and 8th grade math tests. A draft
is already circulating for public comment. Contracts will be awarded by September I. At this
time, it is not known whether each test will be developed by a separate contractor, or whether one
test developer will successfully bid to develop both. In addition, the Education Department and
the test developers will establish a number of technical advisory groups and evaluation studies to
assure the technical quality of the tests.

As part of the process of developing the RFP, the Education Department has held a number of
public meetings with testing experts, state testing officials, and test publishers and others in the
education and civil rights communities. (The Education Department has made the transcripts of
these meetings, and other related documents, widely available on the Internet.) These sessions
have raised a number of important issues which will be addressed as the work proceeds. In
particular, virtually all groups have stressed the importance of ensuring the technical quality of
the tests, and that there be adequate attention to helping parents and the public understand the
nature and purposes of the tests. This is particularly important in light of experiences in a number
of states in which technical problems or public misunderstandings have led to heated controversy
about the testing program. Many urged that the time line be slowed down if necessary, in order
to accommodate these concerns, although the Education Department continues to believe that the
time line is realistic and appropriate. We agree, and see no reason now to delay the Spring 1999
date for the initial test administration.

Second, a number of states anticipate a challenge in integrating these new tests into their ongoing
testing programs, especially states that are now well along in developing new tests aligned with
recently developed state standards. Some states would therefore find it easier to "embed" a
                                                                 H&x-Dilmp COilV'ersioil

 small number of additional test items into their existing tests, rather than administer a separate
 and additional test. However, this approach has been considered and does not appear to be
 technically feasible if we are to have a valid test. Other states have suggested that a 4th grade
 reading test would be more valuable to them if it were administered in the Fall rather than the
 Spring, since their goal--like yours -- is for students to read independently by the end of the 3rd
 grade. The Education Department is studying this possibility.

 Third, many testing experts suggested that the 8th grade math test be based on the NAEP
 framework rather than on the TIMSS framework. They argued that the NAEP framework is
 more explicit and more widely accepted among the states, and that student scores could then be
 reported according to the NAEP achievement levels (basic, proficient and advanced) as will be
 the case with the reading test. The Education Department has determined that this would be a
 preferable approach, that it will be possible to provide individual student scores in terms of the
 TIMSS as well, because of the very high overlap in the content ofNAEP and TIMSS.
 Therefore, the final test will still meet your initial commitment of providing students with
 internationally benchmarked scores.

 Creating a Political Buffer -- Ensuring the Tests are National and not Federal:
 We are working to determine how best to establish an advisory or governing body that can
 provide bipartisan support for this effort, and assuranc.e that the tests measure what they are
 supposed to based on the widely accepted NAEP frameworks. Mike Cohen, Mike Smith and
 other Education Department officials have been consulting with governors of both parties,
 Congressional staff and others, with the aim of establishing an advisory mechanism that will
 garner strong bipartisan support among governors and in the Congress. Secretary Riley met last
 week with Gov. Thompson, and is working to set up a meeting in mid-May with a bipartisan
 group of 8-10 governors, hopefully including Governors Romer, Hunt, Zell and Bob Miller,
 Thompson, Engler and Voinavich. Secretary Riley, Mike Smith and Mike Cohen will also
 continue meeting with Members of Congress over the next several weeks. While the additional
 consultations may change our thinking significantly, our current plan is as follows:
        Create an interim advisory council as soon as possible, in consultation with governors and
         members of congress on a bipartisan basis. We would probably appoint governors,
         business leaders, and educators currently serving on related groups such as the National
         Education Goals Panel, ACHIEVE (the group established to follow-up last year's
         education summit in Palisades), and the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB),
        as well as teachers, testing experts and others. The announcement of this council would
         be an opportunity to demonstrate bipartisan Congressional and gubernatorial support for
        the testing initiative. For example, staff level conversations suggest that key House
         Republicans, including Chairman Goodling, Rep. Frank Riggs and Rep. John Porter,
        would be willing to participate in a White House announcement of an advisory council if
        our consultations continue to proceed favorably.

.      Especially with this council established, we think it may be possible to gain NGA's
        endorsement for the testing initiative at the Summer meeting in Nevada. Both the
        ACHIEVE Board of Directors and the National Education Goals Panel will be meeting in
        conjunction with the NGA meeting. If your schedule permits, it would be possible for
                                                                   Hex-Dilmp Con';'ers(Oil

       you to meet with both groups, to demonstrate broad support for your standards initiative,
       and to help reenergize governors and business leaders behind common educational goals.

      These two steps would create a favorable climate for Congressional consideration of
       legislation to reauthorize the National Assessment of Education Progress and the National
       Assessment Governing Board, which are scheduled for consideration sometime in this
       Congress. At that time, we can determine ifNAGB should assume policy responsibility
       for the national tests, with Congressional support. (At present, NAGB is prohibited by
       law from overseeing the development of individual-level tests.) These steps would also
       improve our ability to win any legislative battles we may face on this issue, such as
       attempts to prohibit the Education Department from using funds for the continued
       development of the tests.

Please note that we are optimistic but not yet confident that we can carry out this plan. Much
will depend upon how effectively we are able to enlist the cooperation of a core group of
Republican governors.

Building momentum through state and local endorsements: As you know, we now have
commitments from leaders in Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina and California, as well as the
Department of Defense Schools. Last month the Council of Chief State School Officers
presented the Vice President with an endorsement of your testing initiative. We are working
with chief state school officers to enlist additional states. In a number of cases, even our biggest
supporters (e.g., Rick Mills from New York) will want to secure the support of the state board of
education and the governor before making public commitments. There are a number of states
which appear promising at present, including Missouri and Vermont, though we have no firm
commitments yet. We hope over the next 3-4 weeks to line up a handful of states for a White
House event, and we are working to identifY states that would be likely to sign up when you
resume your travel schedule.

However, we believe that the prospects for signing up large numbers of states will depend largely
upon establishing an advisory body that has the bipartisan support of governors. This step will
take some time to work out, but is the most effective way of building sustainable momentum.

We are also beginning to develop a strategy for signing up big cities, such as Los Angeles and
Boston, regardless of the respective state participation. The intent here is to further demonstrate
momentum, to underscore that these standards are especially important for the students and
schools for which society typically has low expectations, and to demonstrate that these tests can
in fact be tools to lift people up, by helping to stimulate new and focus existing partnerships and
efforts to improve teaching and learning.

We believe it will be possible, over the next several months, to work with mayors, school
superintendents and school boards, teachers unions, institutions of higher education, as well as
parent, community and business groups in 6-9 cities. We would seek broad partnerships in each
city that would pledge to benchmark their success by using the national tests, and commit to
specific, locally designed efforts in each community to help prepare students to meet these
                                                                 H~x-Dilmp Conversion


standards. We will ask the Education Department to develop a plan for working with these
cities, to provide them with information on proven practices, and to help the cities learn from
each other. A White House event announcing this partnership should generate considerable
excitement and attention. It will also strengthen support for this testing initiative among
members from big cities.

There are a number of steps you can take that will add momentum to these efforts, and we are
developing plans for each. These include:
      Hold a town meeting or other forum on reading and math standards. We'd like to
       create a setting in which you interact with teachers, parents and students, and use
       examples of student work, sample test questions and answers, or videos of teaching to
       high standards, as a way of helping the public come to some concrete understanding of
       what the reading and math standards are really all about.

      Meet with textbook publishers and software developers. Such a meeting would
       provide you with an opportunity to urge (or enlist commitments from) publishers to
       upgrade the quality of textbooks by aligning them with higher standards and expectations.
       You could also highlight the efforts of software developers to produce materials for home
       and classroom use that are aligned with the standards.

      Meet with groups involved in promoting literacy and math achievement. Through
       the America Reads initiative and the Education Department's previous early reading
       initiative, there are several national and grassroots coalitions of groups that are supporting
       early reading initiatives. You can meet with these groups, at the White House or'
       elsewhere, and emphasize the connections between their efforts to promote learning and
       your call for national standards and tests. In addition, as a result of a directive y~u issued
       to the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation last month, there is
       an interagency effort underway to organize federal agency resources, and to identify
       non federal resources (e.g., Nobel Laureates, math and science resources in the business
       community) that can be enlisted to support teaching and learning aimed at preparing
       students to meet 8th grade math standards. We expect to propose one or more events as
       part of this effort. Together, these will enable you to underscore that your testing
       initiative is not just about testing, but about mobilizing the nation to support learning to
       high standards.


2. CHARTER SCHOOLS
One of our key goals is to foster the creation of 3,000 charter schools within 5 years, up from the
current level of 500. One challenge is expanding the number of states with charter schools
legislation. Currently 25 states and DC authorize the creation of charter schools; we would like
to raise the number of states to 30 by the end of 1997. Over the past couple of months, progress
in state legislatures has been slow, due in part to an absence of strong centrist leadership at the
state level, partisan differences, and occasional opposition by state and local union affiliates. In
addition, in at least one state (Virginia) the potential racial impact of charter schools emerged as
an issue. Consequently, no state has enacted charter schools legislation yet this session.
                                                                      H&x-DiJmp COilve:-sioil 

However, there are some bright spots. In Washington State this week the governor, schools
superintendent and legislators have tentatively reached agreement on a charter schools bill, with a
vote in the state House scheduled for Friday. Mississippi is also on the verge of passing a
charter law, although the number of schools authorized would be fairly limited. Charter
legislation is also alive in Missouri (as part of a big post-desegregation package), Indiana, Maine,
and Nevada.

There are several steps that we believe can help move things forward in some of these states.
First, visible Presidential leadership in the near future, in the form of'!ll address to a legislature
on charter schools, a radio address, or other similar event, will lend support to charter schools
advocates.

Second, the Education Department is ready to release two importarit reports on charter schools.
One is the first year report of a major national charter school study. A key finding is that the
number one obstacle for new charter schools to overcome is lack of access to start-up funding.
A second is a guidebook for school boards and other chartering authorities, which emphasizes the
importance of effective accountability for charter schools--an important point, given problems
that have emerged with casually approved schools in DC and elsewhere.

In addition, the Education Department will soon announce a new competition for charter schools
funds. It is also planning a national charter schools conference in late Summer or early Fall.
These activities will provide support both to state efforts and to your request for $100 million for
charter schools.
