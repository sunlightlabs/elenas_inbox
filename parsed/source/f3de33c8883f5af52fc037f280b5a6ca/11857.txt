                          Reducing Gun Violence Radio Address
                                    March 20, 1999
                                 Questions and Answers


Q:   The NRA has criticized this Administration for failing to support Project Exile in
     Richmond, Virginia_ Isn't today a reversal on your position for this initiative?

A:   Not at all. It is important to keep in mind that Project Exile was launched by one of
     President Clinton's U.S. Attorneys, Helen Fahey, who is with us today. We support her
     efforts to collaborate with state and local law enforcement, ATF, FBI, and other
     community leaders to aggressively prosecute armed felons in federal court. Project Exile
     has received national attention for its success: by targeting criminals with guns for
     immediate federal prosecution and stiff mandatory federal prison sentences, they have
     helped to decrease gun homicides by 40 percent, seized over 400 guns, and sentenced
     nearly 200 offenders to an average of 55 months in prison. We believe it is a model that
     other U.S. Attorneys should consider as they assess how best to address their local gun
     violence problems.


Q:   Are you planning to mandate that all U.S. Attorneys prosecute all firearms cases in
     federal court, as they do in Project Exile?

A:   Project Exile is taking an aggressive approach to reducing gun crime and homicides in
     Richmond through increased federal gun prosecutions -- and we believe other U.S.
     Attorneys should work with their communities to consider whether a strategy like Project
     Exile's will help address their local gun crime problems. However, some federal
     prosecutors may find that their gun violence problems significantly differ from those in
     Richmond; for instance, they may have a bigger problem with illegal gun traffickers
     should be targeted who they should target for federal prosecution. Other jurisdictions may
     find that state laws carry tougher penalties than the federal laws for certain gun offenses,
     in which case it may make more sense to prosecute certain gun offenders in the state or
     local courts. The strategy called for today will focus on stepped up prosecutions to
     reduce and deter gun violence, but without mandating a one-size-fits-all solution.


Q:   Haven't federal gun prosecutions actually declined during this Administration?

A:   While the number offederal firearms prosecutions has decreased since 1992, we believe
     that this is in part because federal and state systems are now working better together and
     the federal system is concentrating its resources on significant gun criminals. As a
     result, the number of federal gun offenders that received prison sentences of 5 years or
     more has increased by 30 percent since 1992. Nearly all of the decline in federal
     firearms prosecutions since 1992 occurred among lower level offenders (those who
     receive probation up to 3 years of imprisonment).
                       Hex-Dump Conversion

     Moreover, combined federal and state prosecutions are up from 1992. Between 1992
     and 1996-- when most of the decline in federal firearms prosecutions occurred -- state
     prosecutions of weapons offenders increased sharply, more than offsetting the federal
     decline.

     It is also worth noting that a 1995 Supreme Court decision affected our ability to bring
     certain gun cases in federal court. This issue was resolved when the President signed
     into law a legislative fix to this decision last November.


Q:   Doesn't this directive to create a national strategy to reduce gun violence mean that
     you haven't had one to date?

A:   No. This Administration has taken. some of the boldest, most comprehensive steps ever
     to keep guns off the streets and out of the hands of juveniles and criminals:

           Brady Law. The President stood up to the gun lobby and secured passage of the
            Brady Law, which has helped to prevent over a quarter of a million felons,
            fugitives, and stalkers from getting handguns nationwide.

           National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Last November, we put
            into place the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which has
            already conducted 2.6 million background checks on gun purchasers, and stopped
            over 27,000 prohibited buyers from getting firearms.

           Assault Weapons. The President fought for and secured the 1994 assault weapons
            ban to bar the manufacture and importation of 19 of the deadliest assault weapons.
            Last year, President Clinton took executive action to ban the importation of over
            50 models of deadly modified assault weapons.

           Crime Gun Tracing and Illegal Gun Trafficking. The President's Youth Crime
            Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) is in place in 37 cities to crack down on the
            illegal gun markets that supply firearms to juveniles and criminals. As a result of
            YCGII, crime gun tracing by ATF has increased from about 50,000 traces to
            200,000 traces annually.

     These actions as well as the efforts of communities across the country to combat gun
     violence are having a significant impact: since 1992, the number of violent crimes
     committed with guns has dropped 27 percent.


Q:   How do you plan on paying for proposals that come out of the strategy once it is
     ready?
                      Hex-Dump Conversion

A:   In his directive, the President asked the Secretary and Attorney General to make
     recommendations on how best to allocate federal resources to support the strategy. Our
     FY 2000 budget already proposes new resources at both the state/local and federal levels
     to help address gun violence and public safety: nearly $1.3 billion is proposed to hire
     more local police and prosecutors, add new crime-fighting technologies, and promote
     community partnerships with law enforcement. And his budget provides a nearly $30
     million increase for ATF and U.S. Attorneys to step up their prosecution and enforcement
     efforts.


Q:   Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported that dozens of handguns were sold
     to felons and other prohibited purchasers without background checks in Maryland
     due to a State police backlog. The Maryland State Police blame their backlog in part
     on the FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which took effect
     last November. What is your response?

A:   We do not believe the NICS is responsible for the one to two-month backlog for
     background checks reported in Maryland. Over 70 percent of the background checks
     submitted to NICS are immediately processed; the vast majority of the remainder are
     processed within the day. Moreover, the NICS is currently operating without a backlog.

     Since NICS took effect on November 30, 1999, it has handled nearly 2.6 million Brady
     background checks; of these, the FBI handled 1.3 million and stopped over 27,800 illegal
     gun sales to felons, fugitives, and other prohibited purchasers. The remaining 1.3
     million were processed by states that have agreed to serve as NICS points-of-contact.
     We do not, at this time, have information on the number of denials at the state level.


Q:   What is your response to Representative Barr's NRA-supported legislation to block
     lawsuits that cities have filed against the gun manufacturers? Do you have a
     position on legislation proposed by Senator Boxer to give cities the right to sue gun
     manufacturers and distributors? And do you have a position on the bill introduced
     by Senator Schumer yesterday which would regulate the sale of guns on the
     Internet?

A:   The Barr legislation is an attempt by the gun lobby to avoid the very serious issues about
     gun trafficking and gun safety raised by the cities' lawsuits. We are watching these suits
     closely, and will do all we can to resist efforts that would prevent the cities from
     presenting their evidence. Similarly, we are supportive of efforts such as Senator
     Boxer's that specifically allow cities to put such evidence before the courts.

     While we are still reviewing Senator Schumer's legislation, the President's policy
     continues to be: no background check, no handgun. That is why some ofthe President's
     top firearms-related priorities for the year are to extend the Brady waiting period and to
     ensure background checks at gun shows. We will review the Schumer legislation with
                  Hex-Dump Conversion

this position in mind.

At the same time, we will continue to press forward on our other efforts to stop gun
trafficking, ban violent juveniles from buying guns, and promote gun safety. We will not
-- and we hope individual states and cities will not -- back down to the gun lobby on these
issues.
