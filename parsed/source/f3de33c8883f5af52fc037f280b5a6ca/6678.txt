MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 BRUCE REED                                 Automated Records Management System

SUBJECT:              Education Strategy


        You have proposed a popular, comprehensive education agenda to expand opportunity,
strengthen quality, and help prepare students, especially the most disadvantaged, to reach tough
academic standards and to enter college. These proposals build on your efforts since 1993 to
raise standards, strengthen accountability and expand flexibility, expand public school choice,
and improve the quality of schools by providing them with better prepared teachers and
up-to-date technology.

        Some of your proposals, such as America Reads and the expansion of the 21 st Century
Schools program, stand a good chance of enactment. However, many, including class size
reduction, school modernization, and national tests, face a steep challenge in Congress, where the
majority's education priorities are expanding education IRAs, creating school vouchers, folding
existing programs into block grants, and doing relatively little else. In addition, we will face a
tough battle to fund you education priorities in the appropriations bill, because the Republicans
will advance different spending priorities within education, and because likely Congressional
increases in highway spending will squeeze the funds available to the education account overall.

       In order to overcome Republican opposition and enact significant portions of your
education agenda, we propose a four-part strategy:

       (1) Build momentum by pressing for the proposals that are most likely to pass .

       . (2) Make it costly for Republicans to oppose your new education initiatives -- school
modernization, education opportunity zones, class size -- by getting Democrats to bring them up
every time Republicans try to move a key piece of their education agenda (vouchers, Coverdell,
etc.)

       (3) Pursue a multi-pronged approach to national standards and tests.



                                                1
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

       (4) Conduct a national education campaign to keep your entire education agenda visible
and use the bully pulpit to promote education reform.


I. Building momentum by pressing for the proposals that are most likely to pass with
bipartisan support.
       Several pieces of education legislation reflecting your priorities stand good to excellent
chances of enactment with bipartisan support. Three ofthese (America Reads, G.!. Bill, and the
Higher Education Act) have July I deadlines for enacting necessary authorizations or changes.

         A. America Reads. The House has already passed its version, known as the Reading
Excellence Act, which provides funds to States to improve reading efforts in needy local schools
through teacher training (in research-based methods), tutoring, and family literacy. Sen. Jeffords
has pledged to move a similar piece of legislation in the Senate, though no action is yet
scheduled. We are working to meet a July I deadline imposed by the FY 1998 Appropriations
bill for triggering $210 million advance-appropriated for these purposes (for FY 99), and believe
the deadline can be met if we push. The House bill has some problems but ultimately would be
acceptable, and we expect that the Senate bill will be an improvement.

        B. Charter Schools. Last session the House passed H.R. 2616 by a strong bipartisan
vote (367-57). This bill, introduced by Reps: Riggs and Roemer and endorsed by you would
modify the existing federal Charter Schools Program by (1) steering more federal charter school
funding to states that provide charter schools with the maximum flexibility and strongest
accountability for results, and to states that have not reached a cap on the number of charter
schools permitted by that state's charter schools law, and (2) encouraging states to direct an
appropriate level of other federal education resources that pass through states to charter schools.
Sen. Lieberman and Sen. Coats have proposed similar legislation in the Senate, and the Senate
Labor Committee has scheduled a hearing for March 31. The prospects are good for enacting a
charter schools bill this year, though Sen. Kennedy is not eager to move a charter schools bill,
and controversial issues (e.g., whether to steer federal funds to states that allow entities other
than state or local school boards to authorize and oversee charter schools) still need to be
resolved.

         C. Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (including your mentoring and
teacher recruitment proposals, and the student loan interest rate fix). Both the House and
Senate Committees are scheduled to take up the Higher Education Act in the next few weeks,
aiming for floor action by May and a conference in June. In addition to reauthorizing the main
student aid programs, this bill would include your mentoring and teacher recruitment proposals.
It also needs to include a change in the new student loan interest rate scheduled to go into effect
on July 1. (There is a chance that the Congress will separate out this most pressing component
of the bill. If that happens, the pressure to move the overall bill will subside considerably, and
the chances of having a comprehensive higher education bill to sign before Congress adjourns
will be significantly reduced.)


                                                 2
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

         D. Job TrainingNocational Education. The House passed both ajob training
consolidation bill and a Vocational Education reauthorization bill last year. The Senate has
combined the two, and may act as soon as next week on that package. While there are many
issues that need to be addressed in conference, we are optimistic that a bill can be finalized by
July 1, the deadline for authorizing the Opportunity Areas for Out-of-School Youth program in
order to receive advance-appropriations of $250 million.

        E. After-School Initiative. Your proposed expansion of the 21 st Century Community'
Learning Center Program is quite popular and stands a decent chance ofgaining the necessary
support in the appropriations process, depending upon how much is available for education
spending overall. While there is some additional work to ensure that Sen. Jeffords, who authored
the program initially, remains supportive, our primary effort for this initiative should be to ensure
that your continued association with it as it proceeds through the appropriations process

        F. Technology Initiatives. Your FY99 budget includes over $750 million in
investments on educational technology -- with a new emphasis on technology training for
teachers. Although we do not yet know what the Congressional response will be to the
new initiatives -- we expect that the Congress will continue to support the Technology
Literacy Challenge Fund. We should also expect some continuing controversy over the
"e-rate" -- the FCC's discounts to connect schools and libraries to the Internet. The
educational technology issue also gives us an opportunity to work closely with the private
sector -- and to leverage federal funds. So we can expect victories in this area, and should
make sure that we get appropriate credit and use that momentum.

II. Picking Key Fights to Highlight Your Initiatives.

       There are three issues that provide excellent opportunities to highlight your agenda and
contrast it favorably with Republican proposals. These are also issues where you can unite
Democrats and, if necessary, gain leverage with a veto threat and, in the Senate, a filibuster.

         A. School Modernization: A cloture vote on Coverdell's education IRAs is expected on
Tuesday. In consultation with Secretary Riley, Sen. Daschle has agreed to bring your school
construction proposal to the floor as a substitute, setting up a battle between school construction
and IRAs. On the substitute, we expect to be able to hold almost all Democrats (with exception
of Lieberman and Torricelli), and there is a chance of gaining some Republical1 support as well.
The education groups are working to mobilize grass roots support in favor of the construction
initiative. While the odds are against winning this battle in the short run, defining the issue
visibly at the outset will enable you to keep hammering away at this throughout the spring and
summer.

       B. Education Opportunity Zones: We are working with Rep. Clay to finish education
opportunity zones legislation, and should schedule an event to announce it next month. Voucher

                                                 3
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

advocates are on their strongest rhetorical ground when they conjure up the image of a failing
urban school and use this image to suggest that public education is failing more broadly, and
argue that vouchers are needed to help save a few kids from a broken public education system.
Your Education Opportunity Zones initiative squarely addresses the real problems highlighted by
voucher advocates, but in a way that strengthens public schools and endeavors to help all
students, not just a few. It is based on the premise that we can and must fix failing school
systems and schools rather than abandoning them. It proposes to accomplish this with
investments in accountability measures such as ending social promotions, intervening in failing
schools, rewarding outstanding teachers and removing incompetent ones. If Congressional
Republicans attempt to move a voucher proposal this year, this proposal is our best defense. In
the meantime, you can repeat your call for sweeping, Chicago-style reforms. One opportunity
will be to announce the first grant awards from the new Comprehensive School Reform program
(inculded in last year's appropriations bill by Reps. Obey and Porter), which provides funds for
implementing proven schoolwide reforms such as those developed by the New American
Schools Development Corporation.

         C. Class Size Reduction: The most popular element of your education agenda -- class
size -- is worth a separate, concerted rollout. We believe that next month you should speak to
the legislature in Delaware, where Governor Carper has proposed major class size reductions and
an end to social promotions. The Education Department is developing a series of reports and
other tools for you to announce (e.g., a summary of class size research, a white paper
documenting how smaller classes can led to better classroom practices, and state-by-state figures
on how many new teachers can be hired under your proposal). The elementary and secondary
education groups are able and eager to mobilize grass roots support. We may also have a chance
to press this issue during the budget resolution debate, much of which will concern whether
tobacco revenues can be used for child care and class size.

        The fate of these three initiatives is likely to be determined at the end of the session, as
work on tobacco legislation and tax and appropriations bills are hopefully completed. It is very
unlikely that Republicans will give you victories on class size, school construction or opportunity
zones unless they also get comparable victories on Coverdell or vouchers. While you will most
likely have the greatest leverage to make deals at the end of the ses~ion, you may well have to
decide at that time whether you would be willing to strike deals that give both you and the
Republicans significant parts of your respective education agendas.

III.  National standards and tests
        We face a touch challenge again in Congress this year. We fully expect Goodling to use
the reauthorization of the National Assessment of Education Progress later this year to
specifically prohibit national testing, and to keep RepUblicans pretty well united with him on this
issue. While we were able to keep Black and Hispanic Caucus members with us on a clearly
political vote on the tests earlier this year, we cannot count on their support in the future unless
their concerns about the tests are addressed substantively. Further, while we will have our
greatest leverage once again in the appropriations process, we expect that it will be at least as


                                                 4
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

difficult as last year to secure funding. To increase our odds of winning this battle, we are
pursuing a number of steps to broaden our support. These include:

         Use NAGB and ACHIEVE to change the political dynamics around the tests. Last
year's appropriations agreement placed NAGB in charge of the tests. Since then, we have
appointed Diane Ravitch and Gov. Engler to the panel, in an effort to bolster Republican support.
 NAGB has now taken complete hold of test development, and has made a series of policy
decisions that should make the testing program less vulnerable to criticism from the right.
While Goodling remains almost as hostile to NAGB's efforts as he was to the Education
Department's, early indications are that NAGB is making positive inroads among other
RepUblicans. We have encouraged NAGB to continue to keep members of Congress of both
parties infonned of its work, and Ravitch in particular to make the case to opinion leaders that
the test development is on the right track.

       Lou Gerstner and Achieve are prepared to playa more active role in supporting national
standards and tests, in the context of Achieve's recently launched effort to help states compare
individual student perfonnance across states to each other and to common standards. Achieve's
work parallels a provision in last year's appropriation's agreement, which called on the National
Academy of Sciences to study how existing state tests could be used to compare students to
national standards. We are working to set up an opportunity, such as a conference call with
Achieve's Board of Directors or a one-on-one meeting with Gerstner, in which you can enlist
Achieve's support. We expect that Achieve would be willing to advocate for Congressional
support for a national test and for state efforts to align state tests to the NAEP standards.

       We could also work quietly with Achieve to explore a way for it to take over the work of
deVeloping the tests, if it appeared that we could not sustain the necessary Congressional support
forNAGB.

       Encourage Democrats to propose specific authorization for national tests. Goodling
has argued that we need specific Congressional authorization before national tests can be
developed or administered. (As you recall,we have always maintained that we did not need new
authorization, and we're using the same authority that Bush and Alexander used in proposing
voluntary tests in 1991.) We expect Goodling to take up reauthorization of the National
Assessment of Education Progress later this spring, and to include a specific prohibition on
national tests in that bill.

        To counter this, we are working with George Miller in the House, and Kennedy and
Bingaman in the Senate, to propose their own legislation to authorize national testing, to be
considered as part of the reauthorization of the National Assessment of Education Progress. We
would work with them on the details of the bill, but make sure the legislation was seen as theirs
rather than ours. This would leave them free to cut whatever deals were needed in each body to
build support for the legislation, and not require us to own whatever they came up with. It



                                                 5
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

would also leave us free to continue to argue that we already have sufficient authorization to
proceed with test development, and to fight the testing battle on the appropriations bill.

         In the House, our first priority must be to hold Democrats together, in order to have a
chance of peeling any Republicans away from Goodling. This will be difficult, because there is
little support for testing from significant portions of the Black and Hispanic caucuses under any
circumstances. To have a chance of holding the caucuses, Miller would almost definitely have to
craft a proposal that includes a Spanish-language version of the reading test, a prohibition on use
of the tests for high stakes purposes, protections against test bias, and detailed requirements for
how the test results would be reported. The provisions that will unite Democrats are least likely
to appeal to Republicans, so the more likely result is partisan polarization. Nonetheless, that,
may leave us better positioned than before to conduct a high profile fight with Republican
opponents of the testing.

        The situation in the Senate remains more favorable than the House. There the task for
Kennedy and Bingaman will be to craft a proposal that can hold as much Republican support as
possible. While it is too early to determine the shape of such a proposal, last year's experience
suggests that steps to strengthen NAGB and further guarantee its independence will be necessary.
 The Achieve recommendations are likely to playa role in shaping a Senate bill as well.

       The chances that this approach will lead to authorization bills that pass both houses is
remote at best. However, these steps are necess~ry to hold and expand our support in both
houses, to defend against efforts by Goodling and Ashcroft to ban further work on the test, and to
remove Goodling's basis for drawing support on the procedural grounds that testing should not
proceed without Congressional involvement.

        Pursue an appropriations strategy to enable work to continue on test development.
The most important Congressional action regarding national tests will come in the appropriations
bill, where we must fight to ward off any proposals to prohibit further work and to retain funding
to enable continued development work. The steps outlined above will better position us for a
replay of last year's battle, by better holding Democrats in the House and by taking away
Goodling's charge that the authorizing committees have been cut out of the process.
Nonetheless, it is likely that you will also have to threaten to veto any appropriations bill that
ends funding for the test. This could pose a tough dilemma for the Republicans one month
before the election.


IV. Conducting a National Education Campaign.

        A. Campaign for Education Initiatives. Because this could prove to be a
worse-than-do-nothing Congress on education, it is worth a separate discussion on how to
transform America's schools without help from Washington. The TIMSS roundtable on
Monday is an opportunity to begin that discussion. We believe the bully pulpit can be effective,


                                                 6
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

and a high-profile effort targeted at urban school districts might make a real difference, but the
last two decades suggest it will be very difficult. Nevertheless, our legislative agenda and the
standards movement can only benefit from a vigorous national campaign for education reform.
The campaign should consist of events and actions in support of specific legislative proposals,
events that promote your comprehensive education package, and events that promote state, local
and business action for education reform regardless of Congressional action.

       Specific events we are planning include:

      The upcoming meeting with leaders from business, education and state and local

        Over the longer term, we could begin planning an event to mark the 10 year anniversary
of Charlottesville National Education Summit (September 1999) or the establishment of the
National Education Goals (February 2000). Governors, business leaders and many in the
education community are beginning to anticipate these anniversaries and think about how best to
use them to provide additional impetus for education reform. In light of your personal
leadership at the Charlottesville Summit and in the subsequent establishment of the Goals, it
would be natural for you to lead the effort to look back on what has been accomplished and to
lead the way to define the work ahead.

         B. Campaign on Higher Education. In addition to campaigning for our education
initiatives, we will be ready to kick-off our "Campaign on Higher Education" sometime in the
next 4-6 weeks. This year-long campaign -- which will include events, roundtables, and
dissemination of easy-to-read information packets -- will inform every American that college is
now affordable.

       The focus will be on three key groups: (1) high school/college students who benefit today
from the historic expansion in college aid; (2) middle and junior high school students and their
parents so that we help put them on track for college; and (3) those working adults who need
additional skills, but do not know about the availability of aid to go back to school.

       For our kick-off of the campaign, the Department of Education is finalizing a pamplet
promoting the affordability of college. This pamplet will be sent to every high-school and
middle-school in the country and we will ask every school to photo copy it so that every student
receives the information directly. In addition to this pamplet, we are working with the
Department of Education on a series ofPSAs on college affordability, an interactive Web site,
and other ways of disseminating what we've done to make college more affordable.
