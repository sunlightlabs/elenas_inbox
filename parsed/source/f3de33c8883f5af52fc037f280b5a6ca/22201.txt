PRESIDENT CLINTONO!,S LANDS LEGACY INITIATIVE:


Forging a Conservation Vision for the 21st Century
January 12, 1999

President Clinton, in the FY 2000 budget he will submit to Congress, is
proposing a $1 billion Lands Legacy initiative to expand federal
protection of
critical lands across America, help states and communities preserve local
green
spaces, and strengthen protections for our oceans and coasts.

This landmark initiative -- a 125 percent increase over FY 1999 funding --
represents the largest one-year investment ever in the preservation of
AmericaD!,s lands legacy. It includes $900 million from the Land and Water
Conservation Fund (LWCF), marking the first time any Administration has
requested full funding from LWCF, which draws revenues from federal
offshore
oil sales.  To sustain these efforts in the new century, the President
commits
to work with Congress to create a permanent funding stream beginning in FY
2001.

The Lands Legacy initiative continues the Clinton-Gore AdministrationD!,s
vigorous efforts to save AmericaD!,s natural treasures. And, by providing
significant new resources to states and local communities, it forges a new
conservation vision for the 21st century -- one that recognizes the
importance
of preserving irreplaceable pieces of our natural legacy within easy reach
of
every citizen.

Lands Legacy will be administered by the Department of the Interior (DOl),
$579
million; the Department of Agriculture (USDA), $268 million; and the
Department
of CommerceD!,s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
$183
million. It will be coordinated with the $1 billion Livability Agenda
announced
by Vice President Gore of January 11 through interagency cooperation and
consultation.

In addition, the President is calling on Congress to extend permanent
wilderness protection to more than 5 million acres in 17 national parks and
monuments, including Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Glacier, Great Smoky
Mountains
and Cumberland Gap.

Saving AmericaD!,s Natural Treasures

Federal Acquisitions - The initiative increases federal land acquisition
funding through the Land and Water Conservation Fund by 26 percent to a
total
of $413 million ($295 million for DOl, and $118 million for USDA). In
recent
years, the Administration has dedicated LWCF funds to protecting
Yellowstone
National Park from mining, saving ancient redwoods in CaliforniaD!,s
Headwaters
Forest, preserving Civil War battlefields, completing the Maine-to-Georgia
Appalachian Trail, and acquiring more than 100 other natural and historic·


sites
across the country. Priorities for FY 2000 include acquisition of over
450,000
acres in CaliforniaD!,s Mojave Desert, 100,00 acres for addition to New
England
wildlife refuges and national forests, and lands critical to the ongoing
restoration of FloridaD!,s Everglades.

Protecting Our Parks - The President also is calling on Congress to grant
permanent wilderness protection to over 5 million acres within Arches, Big
Bend, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Crater Lake, Glacier, Grand
Teton, Great Smoky Mountains, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone and Zion National
Parks; Cedar Breaks, Colorado and Dinosaur National Monuments; Assateague
Island National Seashore/Chincoteague National wildlife Refuge; and
Cumberland
Gap National Historic Park. Granting these areas the highest level of
federal p
rotection available would, in the words of the Wilderness Act of 1964,
recognize them as areas "where the earth and its community of life are
untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."

Helping States and Communities Preserve Green Spaces

Land Acquisition Grants - Lands Legacy includes $150 million through LWCF
for
matching grants to state, local and tribal governments, and nonprofit land
trusts, for acquisition of land and easements for urban parks, greenways,
outdoor recreations, wildlife habitat, and coastal wetlands. The DOl
program
retools the LWCF state grants program for "smart growth" and open space
preservation. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis, with priority
going to projects consistent with statewide "smart growth" plans.

Open Space Planning Grants - The initiative proposes a new $50 million
program
of matching grants to states to develop open space preservation and "smart
growth" strategies. States would use a variety of data and tools to
.identify
priority areas for urban development, farmland, and conservation. The
program,
administered by DOl, would award grants competitively, with priority going
to
proposals that tie state plans to regional strategies for managing the
economy,
job growth, and infrastructure development.

Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund - The initiative proposes
$80
million -- a $66 million increase -- for state and local land acquisition
to
protect threatened and endangered species. By supporting Habitat
Conservation
plans and other flexible tools under the Endangered Species Act, the Fund
promotes collaborative strategies that sustain both wildlife and economic
development. The program is administered by the u.S. Fish and wildlife
Service.

Forest Legacy Program - To protect private forest land that provides
critical
wildlife habitat and is threatened by development, the initiative proposes


$50
million -- an increase of more than six-fold -- for matching grants to
states
for the purchase of permanent conservation easements. Use of protected
lands
for forestry and compatible activities is permitted. The program is
administered by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and the proposed funding
would
protect roughly 135,000 acres.

Urban and Community Forestry - The initiative proposes $40 million -- a 29
percent increase -- for matching grants to states and communities to
establish,
maintain, and expand urban and community forests and related green spaces.
The
program, administered by USFS, operates in partnership with 8,000 volunteer
organizations in more than 10,000 communities. The proposed funding would
support 75,000 projects in more than 10,000 communities.

Farmland Protection Program - To protect farmland and sustain rural
economies,
Lands Legacy would provide $50 million in matching grants to states,
communities, tribes and land trusts for the purchase of permanent
conservation
easements on farmland threatened by development. The program, administered
by
USDAO!,s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was created by the
1996
Farm Bill. Through mid-1998, $35 million in federal funding had leveraged
an
estimated $230 million in easements, protecting about 127,000 acres.

Smart Growth Partnership - Lands Legacy proposes a new revolving loan
program
to support acquisition of land and easements in rural areas. The
partnership,
administered by USDA, would make loans to intermediate borrowers (state,
local
and tribal governments, and nonprofit corporations), which in turn would
loan
funds to rural businesses, land trusts and other nonprofit organizations.
Proposed funding of $10 million would support $50 million in loans.
Priorities
are supporting "smart growth" strategies and helping owners of
underproducing
forest land at risk of sale improve forest productivity.

Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery - The initiative proposes $4 million in
matching grants and technical assistance for the restoration of parks in
economically distressed urban communities. The program, administered by the
National Park Service, awarded over 1200 grants from 1978 to 1995 but has
remained unfunded since 1995.

Protecting Our Oceans and Coasts

National Marine Sanctuaries - Lands Legacy proposes $29 million -- a 107
percent increase -- to strengthen protections at 12 marine sanctuaries off
California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, North
Carolina,
Texas, Washington, and American Samoa, and to plan for future marine


sanctuaries. The funding will allow NOAA to accelerate the adoption and
implementation of management plans for existing sanctuaries and expand
outreach
activities with coastal communities.

Coastal Zone Management Act Program - To help promote "smart growth"
strategies
along AmericaC!,s coasts, the initiative proposes $90 million, a 55 percent
increase, to help states implement Critical Coastal Area Management and
Restoration Plans. The matching grants can be used to acquire lands or to
undertake other efforts to protect wildlife habitat, protect life and
property
from coastal hazards, and revitalize ports and urban waterfronts.

National Estuarine Research Reserves System - The initiative proposes $19
million, a 375 percent increase, to expand a network of critical estuaries
representing all the biological regions along AmericaD!,s coasts. NOAA
provides
guidance and matching funds to states to acquire land, protect resources
and
conduct research and education. Twenty-two reserves in 19 states and
territories manage about 500,000 acres. The proposed funding would double
the
protected acreage.

Coral Reef Restoration - Lands Legacy proposes $10.3 million -- a $10
million
increase -- to protect fragile coral reefs from pollution and other human
impacts. NOAA, in conjunction with DOl, would restore injured reefs in
Puerto
Rico, Florida, Hawaii and u.S. territories, and develop a coral nursery to
grow
donor material for restoration projects.

Coastal Dredge Area Restoration - The initiative proposes $10 million for
NOAA
to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to use material dredged from
ports and shipping channels to restore coastal habitats. Dredging is
critical
to keep shipping lanes open and deepen channels to accommodate larger
ships.
Reusing dredge spoils benefits the environment and reduces disposal costs.

Fisheries Habitat Restoration - To restore declining fisheries, the
initiative
proposes $25 million for NOAAD!,s National Marine Fisheries Service to
acquire
and protect critical habitat. Efforts would focus on Northeast and Middle
Atlantic coast, the Gulf Coast, the west Coast, Alaska, and other regions
that
participate in the National Estuary Program or have multiple threatened or
endangered species.
