  TEXT:
  Here's the Murray information you requested:
  1.      A comparison of current law, the Murray amendment, and the draft
  proposal;
  2.      An outline of the Murray amendment and draft proposal;
  3.      A copy of the Murray amendment as passed by the Senate.with
  proposed changes;

  Note: In addition to the issues we discussed, the draft proposal also
  precludes any state, even one with an existing waiver, from providing TANF
  assistance for more than five years,

  Question: given this would you prefer to be silent in the Labor-HHS SAP?
 Alternatively, OMB has drafted language saying 'This was considered in the
 budget. We ended up with a GAO study and we'd rather leave it there."

  This quote may explain the "Social Security number" comment:

 "Mr. President, this body is about to go to a vote that is not one that is
 unknown to this Senate .... that merely allows a woman who is a victim of
 domestic violence a temporary waiver from the work requirements if she
 needs to get medical care or she needs to chang'e her Social Security
 number so that she is not pursued by her abuser, or to put her children in
 a safe place .... " Senator Murray, September 10, 1997

 And a closing quote:

 "It has been passed by the Senate three times. Not one Senator has spoken
 against it. Not one Senator has voted against it. But every time it goes
 behind closed doors in a conference committee it is pulled out, That is
 what happens to abused women constantiy. In the light of day, everyone is
 there to say, 'I support you,' but when they go behind closed doors they
 are abused .... "  Senator Murray, September 10, 1997

(b )Clarifications --
(1)(C) States shall not be limited in the number of waivers they grant.
(1 )(D) Individuals receiving waivers shall not be including for the purposes of determining a

(c) Federal Parent Locator -- adds additional safeguards that information from the Federal Parent

                                 Outline of Proposed Amendment

individual, temporary waivers to victims of domestic violence within the context of the goals of
work and personal responsibility.

(b) Clarifications --
(l )(C) States shall not be limited in the number of waivers they grant.
(l)(D) A state will be eligible for a reasonable good cause exception to the penalites for failing to
meet the work rates or for exempting more than 20 percent of recipients from the time limit if its
failure is attributable to its provision of good cause domestic violence waivers.
(l)(D) A good cause domestic violence waiver is one that is temporary, based on an
individualized evaluation of need; and includes services designed to ensure safety, promote
independence, and prepare for employment.
(2) Provision shall be made effective as if enacted in the welfare reform law.

             (Additions to Murray Amendment are underlined; deletions are striken)

SEC .. PROTECTING VICTIMS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--

(1) the intent of Congress in amending part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
601 et seq.) in section 103(a) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat 2112) was to allow States to take into
account the effects of the epidemic of domestic violence in establishing their welfare programs,
by giving States the flexibility to grant individual, temporary waivers for good cause to victims
of domestic violence who meet the criteria set forth in section 402(a)(7)(B) of the Social Security
Act (42 U.S.C.602(a)(7)(B»;

(2) the allowance of waivers under such sections was not intended to be limited by other,
separate, and independent provisions of part A of title N of the Soeial Seoority Aet (42 U.s.c.
601 et seEJ:.) undermine the law's goals of work and personal responsibility;

(3) under section 402(a)(7)(A)(iii) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 602(a)(7)(A)(iii», requirements under
the temporary assistance for needy families program under part A of title IV of such Act may, for
good cause, be waived for so long as necessary; and
