                            WORKING TO REDUCE JUVENILE CRIME

                                                      June 25, 1998

                                          IMPORTANT ECONOMIC UPDATE

NEW ECONOMIC NUMBERS CONFIRM STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY. As the Vice President left for Texas,
new economic numbers were released showing that the economy remains strong, and inflation low. Among the
findings of today's report:
·       In the first quarter of 1998. the economy grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent;
·       Investment in business equipment rose at an annual rate of 26.4;
·       Private sector growth was 7.2 percent in the first quarter; and
·       The gross domestic product price index rose a mere 1.2 percent at an annual rate. Over the past year,
        inflation rose just 1.4 percent, the smallest increase in 34 years.

Today's numbers reinforce the success of the Administration's economic policy of deficit reduction, investing in
our people, and opening new markets to American good and services. This plan has helped create 16 million
new 'obs, enerate the first bud et su Ius in 30 ears, and reduce unem 10 ent to its lowest level since 1970.


           "Catching criminals and punishing them is important, but it will not replace our shattered feeling ofsecurity, and
it will not bring back the loved ones who have been lost. We need to stop crimes before they start. That means making
sure that our kids grow up with values that will steer them off the wrong path, and onto the right one. "

                                                                                             Vice President AI Gore
                                                                                             June 25, 1998
Today, Vice President AI Gore travels to Texas where he discusses strategies to prevent youth crime and
delinquency. The Vice President announces the availability to states of $232 million in national juvenile justice
and accountability grants and awards funding to Houston, Texas for its anti-gang initiative.

A BALANCED ApPROACH To JUVENILE CRIME. The Clinton Administration is addressing juvenile crime
through an approach which emphasizes tough enforcement measures that hold children accountable for their
actions, but also works with children through targeted prevention and intervention strategies to help them stay
on the track to success.

GIVING STATES AND COMMUNITIES THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. Under the Administration's Anti-Gang
and Youth Violence Strategy, Juvenile Accountabilitv Incentive Block Grants are being offered so states can
promote greater accountability in the juvenile justice system. The Administration fought to ensure that 45
percent of the funding goes directly toward hiring new juvenile justice prosecutors, strengthening the juvenile
court system, and creating new anti-gang strategies that help prevent young people from entering a life of crime.

CUTTING CRIME RATES TO THE LOWEST LEVELS IN A GENERATION. The Administration's leadership in
crime fighting has produced impressive results. Earlier this month, the Justice Department released
preliminary data showing that in 1997 crime rates dropped for the sixth year in a row, the longest period
of decline in a generation. Since 1993, violent crimes have dropped more than 15 percent, and murder
'rates have fallen by over 25 percent.
