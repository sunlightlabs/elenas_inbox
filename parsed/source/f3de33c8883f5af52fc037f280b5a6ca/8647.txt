         PRESIDENT MEETS WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN SUPPORT OF
                    PASSING A STRONG PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS
                                   July 16, 1998

     Today, the President joined Republicans and Democrats on the Hill to support passing a strong
     bipartisan patients' bill of rights this year. Following his meeting yesterday with families,
     doctors, and nurses at the AMA, today the President reiterated his call on Congress to pass this
     legislation before adjournment. The DingellJGanske patients' rights legislation underscores
     the need to address health challenge in a bipartisan manner. Today:

     The President reiterated his call on Congress to pass a strong enforceable patients' bill of
     rights before they adjourn. For nine months the President has been calling on Congress to
     pass a patients' bill of rights that includes: guaranteed access to needed health care
     specialists; access to emergency room services when and where the need arises; continuity
     of care protections to assure patient care will not abruptly change if their provider is
     dropped; access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process for
     consumers to resolve their differences with their health plans; a limit on financial
     incentives to doctors; assuring that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment
     options; assuring that women have direct access to an OB-GYN. Any bill of rights should
     include an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been
     maimed or who have died as a result of health plan actions. A right without a meaningful
     remedy is simply not a right.

     The Republicans in the House and the Senate have outlined proposals that fall far short of
     providing patients' the protections they need. After nine months of ignoring the President's
     call for a strong, enforceable, bipartisan patients' bill of rights, the Republican Leadership has
     responded with a rhetoric-laced, partisan proposals that places the interests of insurers above the
     needs of patients. The fact that RepUblicans have yet to introduce a bill with less than 40
     days left in this Congress raises serious questions as to whether they are truly committed to
     passing a bill of rights or selling a bill of goods American public. The Republican
     proposals fall short in many areas. For example, they:

           Do not guarantee access to specialists. We have heard again and again about
            patients who could not see oncologists or specialists to treat heart conditions or
            diabetes. The Republican proposals do not assure that patients with critical health
            needs have access to the specialists they need.

           Do not limit or require disclosure of financial incentives for doctors. Patients
            should not be put at risk by unknown destructive financial incentives to limit
            patient care.

           Do not compensate patients who are maimed or who die as a result of a wrongful
            health plan action. A right without a remedy is simply not a right. The Republican
            Leadership proposals do not have adequate recourse for patients who are maimed
            or injured by their health plans.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

The Senate Republican proposal introduced yesterday contains even fewer patient
protections than the House proposal. It:

     Does not provide over 100 million Americans all ofthe patient protections they
      need. The Senate Republican proposal only applies to Americans in self-insured plans
      and excludes the majority of Americans. Therefore, those tens of million of Americans
      excluded from these protections would only have the rights they need if every state
      passed every protection into law.

             States patients' rights laws do not provide the protections patients need. As
             a new report released by today Families USA highlights, no state has passed all of
             the protections in the patients' bill of rights, and most states have passed only a
             few of the protections.

             Unfair to Americans in small businesses. Most Americans who work in small
             businesses would not be protected by the Senate Republican proposal. The plan
             explicitly excludes these Americans from these protections and holds them
             hostage to the hope that every state will some day pass these protections.

             Inconsistent with the bipartisan Kassebaum-Kennedy law. Rejects bipartisan
             Kassebaum-Kennedy approach that guarantees insurance protections are extended
             to all Americans.

     Does not provide any enforcement provision. This is even worse than the House
      proposal which contained a weak enforcement mechanism.

The President Remains Committed to Passing a Strong, Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights
in This Congress. The President is committed to working with the Congress to pass
bipartisan legislation to provide patients the protections they need.
