I can't remeber whether we talked before or after you sent me this.
you've put my changes in, right?

U.S. 4th Grade Students Are Internationally Competitive in Science and Math. President
Clinton announced today the fourth-grade results of the Third International Math and Science
Study (TIMSS), which show that U.S. students score above the international average in both
science and math, compared with 25 other participating countries. The President welcomed the
news, calling the results a good first step toward our national goal of being first in the world in
math and science, and a clear indication that our students and schools can compete with those all
over the world.

      In science, U.S. students' average score was 565 -- 41 points above the international
       average science score of 524. U.S. fourth graders were outperformed only by students in
       Korea, and, in tum, scored higher than students in 19 other countries.

      In math, U.S. students' average score was 545 -- 16 points above the international
       average of 529. Only seven countries -- Singapore, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong,
       Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Austria -- outperformed U.S. students, while U.S.
       students outperform those in 12 other countries.

President Clinton added that these results show that U.S. schools are improving. The
mathematics results in particular show gains from a previous international assessment, which had
indicated that U.S. students performed below the international average.

National Standards and Tests for 8th Grade Math Needed for Continued Progress. While
U.S. 4th grade math and science achievement is strong, achievement in 8th grade is relatively
weak, especially in math, based on TIMSS results released in November. However, we know
that American 8th graders can attain the same high results, or better, if states and school districts
make the changes that are necessary: raising expectations, adopting challenging curricula,
improving teaching,and holding students and schools accountable for their performance.

The President's proposal for national standards and a national test in math is an essential tool in
raising achievement. The test will help parents, teachers and school districts set high
expectations and measure progress. It will help identify which schools need help. And it will
help determine what works and what doesn't.

The voluntary national test in 8th grade math will be based on the existing, widely accepted
National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) test, and will also be linked to TIMSS,
allowing students, parents and teachers to see how schools and students did compared with
international benchmarks. The new test will help place a sharper focus on the critical late
elementary, middle school and junior high school years--precisely the years when U.S.
achievement appears to falter. It will also help schools and districts make sure that students
have mastered the basics of math, including the essentials of algebra and geometry, by the end of
grade 8, to give students the foundation to take tough math and science courses in high school to
prepare for college and high-skills jobs.
                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
Grade Math. The President also announced that Governor Paul Patton of Kentucky has asked
that Kentucky be included in the voluntary national tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math
when the tests are first given in the Spring of 1999. Governor Patton joins a growing list of
educational leaders in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina and West
Virginia in endorsing the tests.

                        Good News for American Education at Close of School Year
                                            June 10, 1997
