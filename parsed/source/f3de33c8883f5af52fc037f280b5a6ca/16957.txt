==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================
ATT CREATION TIME/DATE:   0 00:00:00.00
          President Submits Legislation to Restore Tradition~~ty
                                  Tuesday, September 16, 1997


Sensible Bipartisan Legislation. Today, President Clinton will submit legislation to Congress
that restores the President's traditional authority to negotiate trade agreements and break down
barriers to American exports. This negotiating authority legislation will help keep our economy
on the right track and create good American jobs, while honoring our commitment to our
workers and environment. We expect this legislation will garner the bipartisan support it
deserves.

Open Trade is Critical to America's Continued Prosperity. The American economy is on
the move again. The President's three-part economic strategy -- cutting the deficit to spur
private sector investment, investing in critical priorities like education and training, and opening
markets abroad -- is a proven success. Since President Clinton took office, the American
economy has generated nearly 13 million new jobs, unemployment is below 5%, wages are up,
and the deficit has been cut by more than 85%. America is in the midst of a longer period of
sustained growth than any other major economy in the world; one-third of our growth depends on
overseas trade.

American Exports Create Millions of High-Paying Jobs. Our aggressive export strategy has
paid off for American companies and workers. America is once again the world's largest
exporter, the largest producer of semiconductors, and the largest producer of automobiles.
Exports support over 11.5 million jobs in the United States, including one in five manufacturing
jobs. Over the last four years alone, exports have created 1.7 million new jobs -- jobs that
typically pay 15 percent more than non-export-related jobs.

We Need To Keep Breaking Down Foreign Trade Barriers. To keep our economy on the
right track, we need to give the President the power that every President since Ford has had to
break down unfair foreign barriers to American exports. This legislation restores the President's
power to negotiate agreements that will help American businesses compete and win.

Legislation Honors Our Commitment to America's Workers and Our Environment. As
we expand trade, the President is committed to pursuing three objectives: (1) to break down
unfair foreign trade barriers and create good American jobs; (2) to promote and advance worker
rights; and (3) to promote responsible environmental protections. As we renew fast track
authority, our goal has been to give the President an array of negotiating tools to advance those
objectives and .level the playing field for American workers in the trade deals:           .

      Trade Agreements. This bill permits labor/environmental provisions "directly related to
       trade" to be brought back to Congress under fast track authority.

      Side Agreements. The President has extensive executive authority to reach
       labor/environmental agreements with countries. We have already committed to conclude
       companion labor/environment agreements in future trade agreements where appropriate,
       and Chile has already agreed to enter such agreements.


                                                                      A_lite'd ~ecordB Management System
                                                                      Hei(~lSliffip Ul!IM(OO           .
               Other Agreements. This Administration has done more than any other to press countries
                to improve labor and environmental protection -- and we will continue to do so, whether
                through the ILO, the WTO, the UN, or international financial institutions. We should be
                concerned about improving conditions in all countries, not just in free trade partners.

         President is Committed to Ensuring that Everyone Benefits from the Global Economy.
         President Clinton has always recognized that we have a special obligation to help low wage and
         dislocated workers. That's why he fought to raise the minimum wage, provide a more generous
         Earned Income Tax Credit, increase investment in training, and win new pension and health
         benefits for workers. That effort has already brought real results for low wage workers:
                Since the President's 1993 Economic Plan passed, the real average income of the poorest
                 20 percent of families has increased nearly $1,000 -- or 9.7 percent.
                In 1995 -- the most recent year data are available -- America saw its largest decline in
                 income inequality and the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.
         As trade helps America continue to prosper, the President will continue his fight to expand
         opportunities for dislocated and low wage workers.

         Specific Provisions of the Bill Include:

               Authority to Open Markets: The bill gives the President authority to negotiate global,
                regional, sectoral and/or bilateral trade agreements, which would be brought back for
                Congressional approval under "fast track" procedures (extensive consultations, limited
                debate, no amendments). This authority is critical to give our negotiators the credibility
                they need to secure good agreements.

               Reaffirms Commitment to Labor/Environment: The bill includes a specific negotiating
                instruction to improve labor rights and environmental protection abroad (a first-ever
                reference to the environment in fast track legislation). Provisions in bilateral free trade
                agreements must be "directly related to trade," but the Administration may also seek side
                agreements, where appropriate.

               Pursues Trade Priorities: The bill contains negotiating objectives emphasizing key U.S.
                trading interests, such as agriculture, services, investment, intellectual property, and the
                need for the U.S. to preserve its health and safety laws and to vigorously enforce U.S.
                trade laws.

               Enhanced Congressional Consultations: We have added strong language to ensure
                Congress is a full partner in setting objectives and establishing trade priorities for
                American negotiators, including some provisions that have never before been included in
                fast track bills: (1) a requirement that the Administration inform Congress of its
                negotiating objectives for a specific agreement before negotiations begin; (2) a
                requirement that the Administration consult before signing a trade agreement about any
                parallel agreements, such as labor and environmental side agreements.

               Duration. Authority granted until 2001, with extension until 2005 only after a
                congressional vote.
