MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 TODD STERN

SUBJECT:               Race Book


Attached is a new draft of the race book. M~ria and I circulated the previous draft to a relatively
small number of your advisors, and in this new draft Chris has incorporated some, but by no
means all, of their substantive comments. There continue to be several areas of disagreement
between Chris and some of your advisors, with respect both to policy and tone. This memo
doesn't present these disagreements in option form for your decision, as that doesn't seem
appropriate at this time. But, it is intended to help inform your .review of the new draft so that
you can provide guidance on how you want these matters handled.

POLICY DISPUTES

Education (chapter,III.I)

The Compact. The principal dispute is over the new Compact for Equal Opportunity in
Education, which Chris has proposed. The Compact is framed as a program designed to close the
racial gap in achievement, which the chapter describes as our number one goal in education.
Chris sees your ESEA proposals as helpful, but still overly top-down in their prescription of the
means for achieving good results, while not tough enough' in demanding that good results be
achieved.

In order to address the racial gap in achievement, the Compact would act as a kind of results-
based challenge grant. The federal government could provide (1) some new funding and (2)
broad flexibility in existing federal grant programs to school systems that adopt measurable
goals, with a strategy and timetable for meeting those goals. The awarding of grants and
flexibility would depend upon a judgment by experts that the school systems' proposed strategy
was likely to succeed. School systems that failed to produce results - reducing racial disparities
in achievement - would face the loss of at least some funding and flexibility and would have to
work with experts to reform their strategies, including through shock therapy and new
management if necessary.

Bruce and Elena argue that this Compact would undermine your ESEA proposals (1) by giving
ammunition to Republicans who favor block grants (without Chris's insistence on results) and
who will be only too pleased to point to your book as support for their position; and (2) by giving
short shrift to your ESEA proposals in comparison to the Compact. Bruce and Elena also dispute
Chris's characterization of your ESEA proposals as too soft, arguing that these proposals are
sweeping in their range and fundamental to closing the educational opportunity gap by ensuring
schools that fail. Finally, they believe that the targeted, race-specific approach of the Compact is
flawed, preferring universal solutions (such as those embodied in your ESEA proposals) that are
designed to expand opportunity for everyone while disproportionately helping minorities.

Economic development (chapter 111.2)

Gene believes that this chapter could do a better job of reflecting your philosophy on jobs and
economic development, capturing your voice, and ordering your priorities. He is working on
edits in an effort to do this, but these edits aren't ready yet.

Crime -- Racial Profiling (chapter 111.3)

A disagreement between Chris and the interagency group (DPC, White House Counsel, Justice
and Treasury, among others) working on a racial profilng Executive Order may be resolved
shortly. The issue, which Justice is trying to work out with INS during the next few days,
concerns whether there is any need for an "INS exception." If there is not, then the Executive
Order could begin with an unqualified statement that racial profiling is wrong and should be
banned, followed by a direction to the relevant federal agencies to undertake a data collection
effort to find out what is happening in the field and ensure that profiling isn't used. The
interagency group and Chris could all agree on such an approach.

On the other hand, ifthe interagency group does not believe we can issue an outright ban on
profiling, because of concerns at INS or Customs, their preferred approach would be a strong,
though not categorical, statement followed by a call for data collection in order to determine what
steps need to be taken on the federal level. Chris would oppose that approach because he
believes the Order should include a ban. His personal preference is for an outright ban, with no
exceptions. In the book, however, he has opted for a fallback position under which the Order
would ban profiling with an escape valve for extraordinary showings - e.g., by INS in certain
situations on the southwest border - as presented in the current draft of the book. The consensus
of the group (other than Chris) is that an Order including an exception of the kind Chris has
articulated will be portrayed as acceptance of racial profiling, and thus actually be criticized by
civil rights groups.

Civil Rights -- School funding (chapter 111.4)

The draft chapter on civil rights includes a fairly muscular endorsement of using Title VI
sanctions to address disparate impact in allocating resources among schools. This is consistent
with a number of references in the education chapter that express disapproval with the use of
local property taxes to fund schools. ("In recent years, there have been over a dozen law suits
brought under state constitutional provisions, challenging the school finance systems established
by state laws. These have met with some success. I hope much more change of this sort is on
the way.") Chuck Ruff notes that there are differing views among DOJ, Do Ed and DPC on the
use of Title VI to address resource allocation, that the discussion in the book may raise questions

about the legality of school funding schemes all over the country, and that more policy discussion
is needed before you get out front on this issue.

TONE AND MESSAGE

A number of concerns have also been voiced regarding tone or message. They include:

   It isn't credible at this late date to add "heart" to your traditional triad of opportunity,
    responsibility and community. It's fine to say that racial reconciliation requires a change in
    people's hearts, but not to add a fourth leg to your traditional litany, as if you just realized
    that something has been missing there for the last seven years.

   Responsibility, while listed in the litany, is not emphasized enough in the body of the book.
    There is an intensive focus on the need to provide greater opportunity to minorities in order
    to close racial gaps in education, economic development, treatment by the criminal justice
    system, health care and environmental justice, but there is not enough of your traditional
    emphasis on the need for all of us, including minorities, to assume responsibility -- work
    hard, play by the rules, support our children, etc.

   The book doesn't adequately capture your voice, the special character of your discourse on
    race, as evident in speeches like Memphis, Austin, etc. To some degree, this comment
    overlaps with the previous one about responsibility, but it is broader than that.

   The book fails to change the terms of the race debate for the 21 st century, which was one of
    the primary objectives of the race initiative.

   The tone of the book is, at least at times, too downcast. For example, the opening poem, an
    Ojibway prayer, begins, "Grandfather, look at our brokenness." In a couple of chapters (Part
    II and Part V), there is an extended discussion about why your generation failed to pick up the
    torch from Dr. King, musing about whether the combination of assassinations, Vietnam and
    riots knocked the wind out of your idealism, wondering whether your generation stood aside
    because you thought further progress was inevitable, or would be taken care of by others, or
    was just too difficult or fatiguing.

These concerns are by no means shared by all your advisors, but have been expressed by a
number of them.
