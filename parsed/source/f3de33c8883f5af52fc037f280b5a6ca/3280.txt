            Talking Points for Directive on Law Enforcement in Indian Country

Background
     There is a federal responsibility for law enforcement in Indian Country.
      Approximately 1.2 million Indian citizens live on lands governed by federally recognized
      tribes. The federal government generally has jurisdiction over major crimes committed
      on Indian lands.

      There is a crisis in public safety and law enforcement in Indian Country. While
       violent crime is falling nationwide, it is rising on American Indian reservations. Since
       1992, homicides have risen over 80% in Indian Country, while nationwide, homicides
       have decreased by about 16%. The homicide rate for Indians is the highest of any ethnic
       group and more than double the rate of the white population.

      Law enforcement resources in Indian Country are inadequate and have been
       dwindling. There are only half as many officers per capita in Indian Country as
       compared to the rest of the United States. Resources for the Bureau of Indian Affairs
       which funds law enforcement for Indian Country have decreased since 1992-- standing in
       stark contrast to other federal law enforcement agencies have had increased funding
       during the same period.

President Clinton's Directive
     Making improved law enforcement on Indian Country a priority. The Executive
      Memorandum (should be signed on or before July 9) directs the Attorney General and
       Secretary of the Interior to analyze the law enforcement problem in Indian Country and to
      submit options to the President by October 31 to improve public safety on these lands.

      Continuing Govemment-to-Govemment Relations with tribes. In keeping with the
       President's 1994 Memorandum on govemment-to-government relations with tribes, the
       memorandum requests that the Attorney General and the Secretary ofthe Interior work
       with tribal leaders during the process.

      Building a consensus to solve the problem. Upon receiving the President's directive,
       the Attorney General and Interior Secretary will appoint a IS-member committee,
       including agency representatives, tribal leaders, and experts to develop recommendations
       on how best to address criminal justice problems in Indian Country.

Clinton Administration's Accomplishments
      In addition to seeking increased funding for the Interior Department, and tribal control of
       law enforcement programs on Indian lands, the Clinton COPS Program has helped tribal
       law enforcement agencies to hire officers in Indian County.

      This year, the FBI established an Office ofIndian Country Investigations in its Violent
       Crimes Section, allocating additional agents to Indian Country. The FBI also initiated a
       nationwide outreach training program for Indian Country law enforcement officers.
