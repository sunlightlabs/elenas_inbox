MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report


         Health Care -- Home Care Reimbursement Controversy Update: Home care
providers across the nation are pushing Congress to modify the Medicare reimbursement change
included in last year's Balanced Budget Act. As you will recall, these changes (a phased in
prospective payment system similar to the one that has effectively constrained hospital payments)
were made to address the unprecedented increases in home health expenditures -- from $4.7
billion in 1990 to $17.2 billion in 1997. Less than a year into implementation of these changes,
home care providers are advising Members that these cuts are too severe, penalize efficient
providers, and are unfair to providers who serve a disproportionate numbers of sicker patients.
There appears to be some validity to these concerns in certain areas. Your letter to Val
Halamandaris ofthe National Association for Home Care, advising him of your commitment to
develop an administratively feasible, budget neutral fix was well-received. Congress also wants
to respond, but has been unable to develop a politically and economically acceptable alternative.
It appears that a budget neutral policy cannot receive sufficient political support because it ends
up being more of a "re-arranging the deck chairs" approach that alienates as many Members as it
pleases. However, putting more money on the table would require extremely unpopular
Medicare offsets. On Thursday, in frustration, Rep. Thomas and some other Members of the
Ways and Means Committee criticized HCFA for its lack of response. We will continue to look
at all options, but it now appears that the only way to pass an acceptable alternative will be to
find some more Medicare savings. However, it is highly likely that the Congress will push hard
for us to deliver on some political cover and savings to mitigate the payment problems now being
experienced by the home care providers.

        Health Care -- Patients' Bill of Rights Event: On Monday, you are scheduled to
attend a large patients' bill of rights event in Kentucky. Consistent with your discussion with
the Democratic caucus, you will use this event to highlight the numerous shortcomings of the
Republican Leadership bills. The President of the Kentucky Medical Association, a lifelong
Republican, is currently scheduled to participate in this event and discuss the AMA's
disappointment with the Republican bills. Other major provider and consumer organizations
will also validate this message and praise your leadership for putting progress ahead of
partisanship. We have been working with the House Democratic Leadership and the
Departments on how best to differentiate these bills, and Secretary Shalala has submitted
an op-ed highlighting the important differences. Finally, at this event, you will announce that

                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
part of your continuing efforts to bring all Federal health programs in compliance with the
patients' bill of rights, even as Congress delays passing legislation.

        Health Care -- Elder Abuse: We are working on an initiative that you could potentially
unveil in an event late next week that responds to continuing reports of problems of elder abuse.
HHS and NIH have been working on reports that document emotional, physical, psychological,
and financial abuses of older Americans, often by family members. This initiative would
include: announcing new Justice Department grants to help identify and prevent elder abuse;
creating a new center on elder abuse, and renewing the call on Congress to reauthorize the Older
Americans' Act, which includes services to help elders at risk for abuse. We will also work
with aging advocates and others to help highlight some of the best practices in the states to crack
down on elder abuse. This initiative compliments your recent initiative to ensure that patients'
in nursing homes are provided with the highest quality services possible.

         Education -- National Board for Professional Teaching Standards: Mr. Goodling
has agreed to drop his provision in HEA prohibiting funding for the National Board for
Professional Teaching Standards, in exchange for the Administration's agreement to
resolve differences in OMB and C.O. scoring of the student loan program. Goodling also
agreed not to offer amendments to end federal support to NBPTS to other legislation this
year, such as the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. While this deal protects the
Board for this year, we expect Goodling to pursue his agenda against the Board in next
year's reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Our efforts over
the last few weeks have demonstrated that while the Board enjoys broad bipartisan there is
little deep support for the Board in the House, and that even Senate supporters of the
Board have questions about its operation. We will continue to work closely with Gov.
Hunt and the NBPTS on a strategy to shore up support for the Board in both the House
and Senate.

        Education -- Bilingual Education: Rep. Riggs bilingual education bill was scheduled for
a floor vote Thursday evening. However, the Republican leadership pulled the bill before it
could come to a vote. The Democratic whip counts indicated strong Democratic unity and the
Hispanic Caucuses believes there would have been Republican opposition to Riggs from some in
the New Mexico, Texas and Florida delegations. The bill could still come up after the recess,
though Riggs is likely to have difficulty getting floor time in September.

[ELENA: THE FOLLOWING IS USEFUL PRIMARILY TO SEE IF HE'S GOT ANY
REACTION OR GUIDANCE FOR US. IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT NOW, I'D
PROBABLY DROP IT]

       Education -- National Education Goals Panel: The National Education Goals Panel
met last week to begin discussing the future of the National Education Goals and the
NEGP. The Panel is scheduled to complete its deliberations on this issue in early

                                                2
                                                                    Automafed ReCOrds Management System
                                                                           Hal(-Oump Convarsion
handle this issue. Thus far, there appears to be a bipartisan consensus among the
governors on the panel, supported by Secretary Riley, that it is important to continue to
have national education goals in some fashion, beyond the year 2000. There is also
agreement that there must continue to be a mechanism to monitor progress toward
reaching the goals, though little certainty that NEGP in its current form is the right
mechanism for carrying out that function. Along with Secretary Riley, we believe that
you, rather than the Goals Panel or the governors alone, ought to lead an effort to examine
what has been accomplished in the near-decade since the goals were established, and what
the Nation's education goals ought to be for the future. However, we also believe that it
will be much more difficult now than in 1989 initiate a process for establishing new goals,
or even reaffirming the existing ones. It will be more difficult for control of the process to
be shared between the Administration and the Governors to the relative exclusion of other
parties and even if we could, much more difficult to establish bipartisan consensus with the
Governors. Yet, a more open process could be even more difficult to bring to a productive
conclusion. Despite the concerns, we are beginning to think through a strategy for how to
proceed in this area.

         Community Empowerment -- Empowerment ZonesiEnterprise Communities
(EZ/EC):      Last Friday, a bipartisan coalition led by Senators Jeffords, Leahy, and Warner,
introduced legislation that would provide grant funding for the second round of Empowennent
Zones. This bill, the result of month-long negotiations between the Administration and Senate
staff, differs from the Administration's earlier bill in several key areas. In addition to providing
flexible grants to the second round EZs the bill would provide: 1) funds for a new demonstration
program called Rural Opportunity Communities (ROCs) to spur economic development in
communities that cannot qualify for the EZIEC program; 2) a new pool of money for
well-perfonning ECs and EZs that have exhausted their existing resources; 3) a preference for
high-perfonning first round ECs who are applying for a second round EZ. In the coming weeks,
DPC, OYP, and NEC will continue to work closely with HUD and USDA in procuring
additional cosponsors for this legislation and work to secure its passage as a rider on
revenue-related legislation out of the Senate Finance Committee.

        NOTE: (Elena, in response to your e-mail, OVP is still waiting to get sign-off from
the Vice President about delaying the report from the Commission on Digital Broadcasting
until late November. They have asked therefore that we include an update for POTUS
next week.)

        Crime -- Concealed Weapons Legislation -- On August 5th, the Judiciary Committee
favorably reported legislation (H.R. 218) expanding the right of certain persons to carry
concealed weapons across interstate lines. As originally introduced -- and proposed by the
Fraternal Order of Police -- this bill would have allowed current and fonner law enforcement
officers to carry concealed fireanns across state lines. As amended in the Judiciary Committee
-- and with strong support from the NRA -- the bill would also allow private citizens with


                                                 3                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Convarsion
other states that pennit concealed weapons.

        Currently, 29 states are required to issue concealed weapons pennits to persons not
prohibited from owning a fireann (generally, a convicted felon); 13 states may issue concealed
weapons pennits, but retain some discretion in approving and denying applicants; 7 states
prohibit the carrying of a concealed weapon; and only 1 state -- Vennont -- does not require any
pennit or license to carry a concealed weapon. The practical effect of H.R. 218, as amended, is
to allow millions of gun owners to carry concealed and loaded weapons on an interstate basis in
43 of the 50 states.

        Crime -- Law Enforcement: On Friday, the House Crime Subcommittee is scheduled
to mark up legislation to provide college scholarships to the children and spouses of local law
enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. In 1996, you signed legislation to provide such
scholarships to the dependents of slain federal officers; last year, you called on Congress to
expand these educational benefits to families of state and local law enforcement as well. Similar
legislation passed the full Senate in May.

        Gay and Lesbian Issues -- Sexual Orientation Executive Order Upheld: The House
blocked a measure, sponsored by Rep. Hefley, that would have prohibited funding to implement
your May 28 executive order which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in the
federal civilian workforce. By a vote of252 to 176, the House rejected arguments that this
executive order would lead to affinnative action for gays and lesbians. Sixty-three Republicans
joined 188 Democrats and the one independent in voting against the measure. The DPC, along
with Counsel's Office and OPL, worked closely to ensure that House members had infonnation
to rebut arguments about special preferences. A recent Wall Street JoumallNBC News Poll
showed that 72 percent supported the order against antigay bias in federal agencies, while only 20
percent opposed it.

       Children and Families -- After-School Programs and Service: You asked us to look into a
proposal from a White House Fellow to eannark 15 percent of proposed funding for the 21st
Century Community Learning Centers program for after-school programs run through the
Corporation for National Service (CNS). Strengthening the connection between service and
after-school activities is important, and service is in fact already a significant part of the current
21st Century program. However, specific earmarking from an Education Department program
to the CNS might be disadvantageous for both programs: (1) funds from the Education
Department come with many more restrictions on their use than CNS dollars; (2) additional
eannarking would drain the 21 st Century program of resources (the Administration's budget
proposal already targets 10 percent of program funding to community-based organizations, and
the House Appropriators cut our budget request from $200 million to $60 million); and (3) it
would lessen our ability to promote greater utility of public school buildings during after-school
hours. We will, however, continue to explore ways in which we can provide greater support and

     funding both to traditional after-schoolleaming programs and specific service-oriented
     programs.

             Welfare Reform -- Minorities on Welfare Reform Caseload: The New York Times
     report on the increasing share of minorities on the welfare caseloads highlights some important
     trends and issues that we will explore further. In the meantime, it's helpful to put the
     information in context.

              First, the racial/ethnic composition of welfare caseloads has been changing gradually
     over the last 2S years: whites rose from 38 percent in 1973 to a peak of 42 percent in 1983
     and have dropped steadily to 3S percent in 1997. The proportion of blacks has generally
     declined, from 46 percent in 1973 to 37 percent in 1997. As the New York Times points
     out, the most significant trend is the increase in the Hispanic portion of the case load, from
     13 percent in 1973 to 23 percent in 1997. However, this is not too surprising given the
     rapid increase in the Hispanic population overall. The question is how welfare reform
     may be affecting these historic trends. National data on the raciaVethnic characteristics of
     welfare recipients are only available through June 1997, so it is hard to gauge the impact of
     the past year when welfare reform efforts accelerated so rapidly. Some states have more
     recent data which they shared with the Times, and which may reveal more significant
     trends. It is also worth noting that the caseload data only tells who is currently on the
     rolls; it does not tell the rate at which different groups are entering and exiting.

            Second, the number of white, black and Hispanic families receiving welfare have all
     dropped since 1994 (when caseloads peaked), but the rate of decline has been greater for
     whites than blacks, with an even slower decline for Hispanics.

                                  97               Change
     Whites 1.9M       1.4 M        -26
     Blacks      1.8M        1.5 M               -18
     Hispanics   1.0 M          .9M                              -9

            Third, the changes are more dramatic than the actual mix of who is left on the
     caseloads, at least on a national basis. While the story pointed out important trends, the
     conclusion that the composition of the caseload has changed dramatically seems
     unwarranted.

                   94             97
     Whites        37%            3S%
     Blacks        36%            37%
     Hispanics     20%            23%

            Fourth, there is some encouraging evidence from Census data that the employment
     rates of former welfare recipients are increasing even faster for minorities than for whites

                                                       5
                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                        N~·tlump Con,,;)rs:oil


    (although the actual rates and the disparity between groups remains disturbing). Between
    1996 and 1997, the percentage of all prior year welfare recipients who were employed in
    the next year increased by 28%. The increase was highest for blacks (33%), followed by
    Hispanics (22%) and whites (21 %).

            Finally, there is longstanding evidence that minorities on welfare disproportionately
    share characteristics that may make it harder to leave the rolls: lower education levels,
    lower marriage rates, larger families, employment and housing discrimination, and
    isolation from areas with jobs.
