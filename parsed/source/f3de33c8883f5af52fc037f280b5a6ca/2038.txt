                   U_S_ Sentencing Commission Report on Crack Cocaine
                                              April 29, 1997

     Announcement
         Today, the President released a statement commending the U.S. Sentencing Commission
          for moving forward with recommendations to reduce the disparity between crack and
          powder cocaine penalties. The President directed Director McCaffrey and Attorney
          General Reno to review the Sentencing Commission's specific recommendations and
          report back to him in 30 days.

     Background
          Current federal law requires a 5-year mandatory sentence for 500 grams of powder
           cocaine, but imposes the same sentence for only 5 grams of crack cocaine -- a 100-1
           disparity in sentencing.

           The 1994 Crime Bill directed the Sentencing Commission to issue a report and
            recommendations on cocaine and federal sentencing policy. On May 1, 1995 the
            Commission sent to Congress proposed sentencing changes to equalize penalties at the
            powder cocaine level-- substantially reducing the penalties for crack cocaine possession
            and distribution. They also proposed reducing money laundering sentences. President
            Clinton signed legislation rejecting the Commission's recommendations and he directed
            them to undertake additional review and submit new recommendations.

           Today's report by the Commission recommends that the triggering amount for the 5-year
            mandatory minimum for crack increase from 5 grams to a range between 25 and 75
            grams, and reduce it for powder from 500 grams to between 125 and 375 grams -- this
            will reduce the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine to no more than
            15-1 and to as little as less than 2-1.

           The President has stated before that some adjustment to the penalties for crack and
            powder cocaine is warranted. However, he believes that any revision to the sentencing
            laws must continue to reflect that crack is a more dangerous form of cocaine and that we
            impose tougher sentences for more dangerous offenders. That is why his 1994 Crime
            Bill included an exception to the mandatory minimum drug penalties -- the "safety valve"
            -- for certain first-time, non-violent, low-level drug offenders.

     Clinton Administration: Fighting Cocaine and Emerging Drugs
           President Clinton has submitted the largest anti-drug budget to Congress. Overall drug
            use in the United States has fallen dramatically-- by half in 15 years. Between 1985 to
            1995, the number of current cocaine users dropped by 74%.

           Last year, the President signed his methamphetamine legislation into law, which attacks
            this emerging drug at every level, through regulation of precursor chemicals and directed
            the Commission to increase the penalties for possession and distribution. The President
            looks forward to the Commission's sentencing recommendations on this law.
