D?GO! #C\         P6QP##XP\          P6QXP#Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
DXD
I appreciate this opportunity to present the Administrations views on the upcom
ing reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 196
5. The Administration is working on a detailed reauthorization proposal that w
e plan to submit for your consideration next month. The Department will also s
oon submit to Congress several reports evaluating the implementation and impact
 of Title I, other ESEA programs, and Goals 2000.       Today I will provide an ove
rview of our reauthorization efforts, as well as some of our specific recommend
ations.   If there is one overriding principle that defines what we hope to acco
mplish, it is to end the tyranny of low expectationsD Dand raise achievement le
vels for all of our young people.

StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\       P6QXP#Let me begin by urging the Committee to develop a si
ngle, comprehensive bill reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education A
ct. Some have suggested an approach that could lead to several separate bills.
  This concerns me, because we have worked very hard with the Congress in recen
t years to develop a comprehensive approach to Federal support for education re
form.   If our efforts are to be successful, it is very important for all the pi
eces to fit together, complementing and reinforcing each other to help States,
school districts, and schools to make the changes needed to raise achievement f
or all students. This is why the Administration is developing a single, integr


ated reauthorization proposal, and I hope you will do the same.
StyleO
StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\      P6QXP#I also want to point out that with the nearly simult
aneous reauthorization of the Departments Office of Educational Research and 1m
provement, we have a unique opportunity to develop a comprehensive agenda for i
ndependent research to support improved practices and instruction in elementary
 and secondary education. We should make every effort to develop researchbased
 solutions to the many challenges we face in elementary and secondary education
, and to get the best information on what works into the hands of parents, teac
hers, principals, and superintendents across the Nation.
StyleO
        heading 9#XP\    P6QXp##A\       P6QP#DTHE 1994 REAUTHORIZATION: A WATERSHE
        heading 9 #XP\   P6QXP#D
This is, of course, this Administrations second opportunity to work with Congre
ss on improving the ESEA. The 1994 reauthorization"the Improving Americas Scho
ols Act"reflected a fundamental break with past practice in Federal efforts to
promote excellence and equity in the Nations elementary and secondary schools.
 The 1994 Act took direct aim at transforming a Federal policy that for too Ion
g had condoned low expectations and low standards for poor children. Along wit
h the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, the 1994 reauthorization reflected a bip
artisan effort to raise expectations for all children by helping States and sch
001 districts to set high standards and establish goals for improving student a
chievement.

It has been just four years, and many States and school districts are still pha
sing in the 1994 Act, but already we have strong evidence of its positive impac
t on teaching and learning.  For example, 48 States, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico have developed state level standards and two States have pushed
for standards at the local level. More importantly, there are promising signs
of real progress toward meeting these higher standards in the classroom. The N
ational Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), for example, has shown signi
ficant increases in math scores at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades (See Chart 1).
  The National Education Goals Panel reported that between 1990 and 1996, 27 St
ates significantly increased the percentage of 8th graders scoring. at either th
e proficient or the advanced level on the NAEP math test (See Chart 2) .

Yesterday, the National Center for Education Statistics released the latest nat
ional report card on reading, and I find the results encouraging. As you can s
ee on Chart 3 in my testimony, average reading scores have increased for studen
ts in grades 4, 8, and 12.  I believe this is the first time we have seen such
 acrosstheboard progress, and that is a hopeful sign indeed. Making sure that
every child can read well and independently by the end of the 3rd grade is a ke
y benchmark of whether or not American education is improving.

We also have information showing progress in TitleI, the flagship ESEA program
that targets assistance to disadvantaged and minority students in highpoverty s
chools.  Title I has contributed to the rapid development of challenging State
standards that apply to all students in Title I schools. Teachers in Title I s
chools are increasingly reporting that standards are helping to guide instructi
on. Moreover, preliminary data gathered for this reauthorization from States t
hat have implemented the Title I standards and assessment provisions generally
show increased achievement levels in highpoverty schools.

For the 199798 school year, 70f the 10 States with standards and aligned assess
ments in place for two years report increasing percentages of students meeting
proficient and advanced performance standards in schools with poverty rates of
at least 50 percent. These State level data are particularly encouraging since
final assessments are not required to be in place until school year 20002001.
This and other information, including data indicating that TitleI is driving hi
gher standards to poor districts and schools, will be discussed in greater deta


il in the Congressionally mandated National Assessment of Title I scheduled for
 release in late February.

Turning from the national to the State level, individual States have made notab
Ie progress in a very short period of time (See Chart 4). North Carolina, for
example, more than doubled the percentage of its 8th graders scoring at the pro
ficient or advanced levels on the NAEP math test, from 9 percent in 1990 to 20
percent in 1996.  In Texas, the percentage of 4thgrade students reaching the NA
EP proficient or advanced levels rose from 15percent in 1992 to 25 percent in 1
996.

We also have evidence of improving achievement in urban   school districts enroll
ing significant numbers of poor and minority children.    In Signs of Progress, a
 1998 report from the Council of Great City Schools, 18   urban school districts
reported increased scores on national, State, and local   achievement tests.

         P6QP#DCHANGING THE WAY WE DO BUSINESSD
         P6QXP#
I believe we are seeing this progress in part because the 1994 reauthorization
changed the way we do business at the Federal, State, and local levels. The 19
94 Act included provisions to improve teaching and learning, increase flexibili
ty and accountability for States and local school distric~s, strengthen parent
and community involvement, and target resources to the highest poverty schools
and communities. There is strong evidence that these changes, particularly the
 emphasis on high standards and new flexibility to innovate, have helped States
 and school districts carry out the hard work of real education reform.

#A\      P6QP#DSetting High Standards
o
#XP\     P6QXP#States that led the way in adopting standardsbased reforms"like Ken
tucky, Maryland, North Carolina, and Oregon"found new support from Federal prog
rams that helped them to raise reading and math achievement.  In other States,
the new ESEA and Goals2000 encouraged and supported improvements in teaching an
d learning tied to high standards.  For example, in a report on Goals 2000 prep
ared by the General Accounting Office (GAO) at the request of the Chairman of t
his Committee, we were most pleased that State officials described Goals 2000 a
s a significant factor in promoting their education reform efforts and a cata
lyst for change.

The National Education Goals Panel issued a report authored by the RAND corpora
tion that examined the experience of North Carolina and Texas. This report fou
nd that the most plausible explanation for the testscore gains was an organiz
ational environment and incentive structure based on standardsbased reform, def
ined as an aligned system of standards, curriculum, and assessments; holding s
chools accountable for improvement by all students; and critical support from b
usiness.  The report also tells us that the willingness of political leaders to
 stay the course and continue the reform agenda, despite changes of Governors
and among legislators, is another key element that has defined the success of t
hese two leading States, which enjoyed both the largest achievement gains and s
ignificant progress in closing the achievement gap between minority and majorit
y students.                                                          .

         P6QP#DNew FlexibilityD
         P6QXP#
At the Department of Education, the 1994 reauthorization sparked a determined e
ffort to give States and school districts greater f~exibility to make innovatio
ns that help all students reach high standards.  For example, we systematically
 examined every Department regulation and set very specific criteria for regula
ting only when absolutely necessary.  The Office of Management and Budget has s
upported this approach, and other Federal agencies have since adopted it as a m


odel. Under our new regulatory criteria, we found that we needed to issue regu
lations for only five of the programs included in the 1994 ESEA reauthorization
  thus we eliminated a full twothirds of the regulations previously covering th
e Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

Another major improvement was to give States the option of submitting a single,
 consolidated State application, instead of separate applications, for the majo
rity of ESEA programs. Not surprisingly, every State but one has adopted this
approach, which both reduces paperwork and encourages a comprehensive approach
to planning for the use of Federal funds.  Moreover, States now submit their si
ngle plan just once during the life of the authorization cycle, with brief year
ly updates to ensure accountability.  States reported in fiscal year 1996 that
the consolidated application slashed paperwork requirements by 85percent.

In addition, the Department has vigorously implemented the waiver provisions in
cluded in the 1994 reauthorization, which permit States, school districts, and
schools to request waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements that presen
t an obstacle to innovative reform efforts if there are adequate accountability
 safeguards in place. Our efforts included a waiver Hot Line as well as compre
hensive waiver guidance at our site on the world wide Web.

Since the reauthorization of ESEA in 1994, the Department has received 648 requ
ests for waivers from States and local districts and granted a total of 357 wai
verso Overall, the Department has approved 55 percent and disapproved 8 percen
t of all waivers requested. Of the remainder, 28 percent were withdrawn largel
y because districts learned that they had sufficient latitude or flexibility un
der existing law to proceed without a waiver, demonstrating that the ESEA is mo
re flexible than many people thought even without the waiver authority.

Another approach to flexibility is the EDFlex demonstration program, which allo
ws the Department to give States with strong accountability mechanisms the auth
ority to approve waivers of certain Federal statutory and regulatory requiremen
ts that stand in the way of effective reform at the local level.  Congress has
authorized up to 12 States to participate in EDFlex.

We are proposing to expand EDFlex to allow all eligible States to participate.
 I believe such an expansion should be considered in the context of reauthoriza
tion and our emphasis on accountability for results.   EDFlex can be an importan
t tool for accelerating the pace of real reform in our schools, but it must be
done thoughtfully.  EDFlex cannot be used to get around established civil right
s protections, or to undermine the overall purpose of helping disadvantaged chi
Idren reach the same high standards as other children.

#A\      P6QP*OFederal Education Dollars to the Local LevelO
#XP\     P6QXP#
Body Text#&J\    P6Q&P##XP\      P6QXP*One final issue I want to touch on is the Dep
rtments performance in getting Federal education dollars to the local level, wh
ere they can do the most good. There have been a number of    dollars to the cl
assroom proposals over the past two years based on the assumption that the Depa
rtment of Education retains a significant portion of Federal elementary and sec
ondary appropriations to pay for administrative costs.

The truth is that over 95percent of all the dollars appropriated by Congress fo
r ESEA programs already go to local school districts. Almost all of the rest g
oes to States to provide technical assistance, to support the use of standards
and assessments, and to provide oversight.  If the 95 percent figure sounds fa
miliar, it is because some of those proposals I mentioned promise to send 95 pe
rcent of Federal dollars to the classroom.

I recognize that some may argue about whether the   local level is the same as


the classroom. My view is that once the funds reach the local level, it is up
to local elected school boards to decide how best to spend them to achieve the
purposes of the programs enacted by the congress.

I believe that these accomplishments"widespread adoption of challenging standar
ds, promising achievement gains nationally and even more improvement in leadin
gedge States, and new flexibility for States and school districts"show that we
were on the right track in 1994. The evidence demonstrates a clear connection
between raising standards and raising student achievement. The record also sho
ws, however, that many States and districts are still phasing in the 1994 refor
ms. Taken as a whole, this experience provides a compelling argument for the A
dministration and Congress to keep working together to help States and school d
istricts get high standards into the classroom, and to push for improved incent
ives and strengthened accountability mechanisms to ensure that these reforms ta
ke hold.

         P6QP#ODISTURBING GAPS REMAINO
         P6QXP#
The overall progress I have described cannot hide the fact that disturbing gaps
 remain in the educational performance of this Nation.   In the areas of math an
d science, for example, the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS)
provides the latest evidence of a longstanding pattern of declining performance
 in math and science as students move through our elementary and secondary scho
ols. Our 4th graders score among the best in the world in these subjects, our
8th graders are in the middle of the pack, and the performance of our 12thgrade
rs in math and science ranks near the bottom of the nations participating in TI
MSS.

 Body Text In particular, progress toward closing the gap in achievement betwee
n disadvantaged and minority students and their more advantaged peers has stall
ed in recent years. Yesterdays NAEP reading report only confirmed what many ot
her studies have shown over the past several years:  children in poverty, defin
ed in this case as those who receive free and reducedprice lunch, are almost tw
ice as likely as other children to be read below the basic level.

These achievement gaps are mirrored and exacerbated by two key systemic problem
s that we will try to address through our reauthorization proposal:  the teache
r gap and the accountability gap.

         P6QP#OToo Many Unqualified Teachers in Our ClassroomsO
         P6QXP#
Research shows that qualified teachers are the most important inschool factor i
n improving student achievement, yet more than 30percent of newly hired teacher
s are entering the teaching profession without full certification, and over IIp
ercent enter the field with no license at all.

Our ability to raise academic standards also is hindered by teachers teaching
out of field.  Overall, nearly 28percent of teachers have neither an undergradu
ate major nor minor in their main assignment fields.  Another significant conce
rn is the practice of using teacher aides as the primary instructors.#C\         P6Q
  #XP\   P6QXP#All of these individuals are trying to do their best, but where t
hey are being asked to take the place of a teacher we are shortchanging our stu
dents.

Highpoverty urban schools are most likely to suffer from unqualified teachers.
 The National Commission on Teaching and Americas Future reported in 1996 that
"in schools with the highest minority enrollments, students have less than a 50
% chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who holds a license and a
degree in the field he or she teaches."


We cannot expect our students to reach high standards until every classroom is
led by an experienced teacher capable of teaching to high standards. We must d
o more to ensure teacher quality, particularly in highpoverty schools.

#XP\     P6QXP#Many States are not yet implementing proven practices that are work
ing in some of the States that are making the most rapid progress. According t
o recent special report on accountability in Education Week, 36 states issue sc
hool report cards, 14 do not, and fewer than half of the parents in States that
 do issue report cards are aware of their existence.

The report also tells us that only 19 States provide assistance to low performi
ng schools, and only 16 States have the authority to reconstitute or close down
 failing schools. Only about half the States require students to demonstrate t
hat they have met standards in order to graduate, and too many still promote st
udents who are unprepared from grade to grade.  We need to provide incentives f
or all States to develop and implement strong accountability mechanisms.

P#broader context for our ESEA reauthorization proposals. To close these gaps"
and the achievement gaps that they perpetuate"we have developed a comprehensive
, threepart strategy of   (l)targeting investments to disadvantaged children, wi
th particular attention to the early years of schooling;   (2)improving teacher
quality, and (3) real accountability.   All these pieces need to fit together if
 we want to raise achievement levels.

First, our investments in Title I, the ClassSize Reduction program, the Reading
 Excellence Act, education technology, and afterschool programs"to name just a
few"are all part of our effort to get communities and their teachers and princi
pals the resources they need to raise achievement for all students. We have pu
t a real emphasis on the early years of schooling because research and common s
ense tells you that if a young person can master the basics early, they get of
f to a much better start in their education.

We want to improve academic achievement for all students, with a special emphas
is on closing the gap upward between poor and minority students and other stude
nts.  This is why, for example, we are such strong supporters of reducing class
 size in the early grades. Research from the Tennessee STAR study demonstrated
 that reducing class sizes in the early grades led to higher achievement for al
1 students, with poor and minority students showing the greatest gains.

Second, we think it is absolutely essential to put a highly qualified, dedicate
d teacher in every classroom in America. John Stanford, the inspiring former s
uperintendent from Seattle who recently passed away, had this marvelous slogan
that summed up his philosophy:   the victory is in the classroom.   If we are go
ing to achieve many more victories in the classroom, we simply have to raise te
acher quality and get many more certified teachers into our TitleI schools. Th
is is why we asked the Congress to create a strong teacher quality initiative i
n the Higher Education Act reauthorization last year. Our intent here is to ma
ke high standards part of every teachers daily lesson plans.   I will discuss th
is part of our proposal in greater detail later on in my testimony.

Third, we want to support Governors and States that are putting into place stro
ng mechanisms to hold districts, schools, principals, and teachers accountable
for student achievement. And we want to provide incentives to those States and
 communities that have been slow to undertake the hard work and difficult decis


ions entailed by real accountability.

#A\      P6QP*Strengthening AccountabilityO
#XP\     P6QXP#
President Clintons State of the Union address highlighted a package of account a
bility measures that forms the core of our approach to accountability in the ES
EA reauthorization. Stronger accountability is the third part of our broad str
ategy of improvement. These measures build on the accountability provisions in
cluded in the 1994 reauthorization, and are critical to ensuring that the subst
antial Federal investment in elementary and secondary education is used wisely
and actually produces the desired results for all of our children.

 Body Text Much of our thinking about accountability has been informed by succe
ssful accountability initiatives at the local and State levels. The most thoug
htful education leaders at the State and local level are doing what we are prop
osing:  they are ending social promotion, requiring school report cards, identi
fying lowperforming schools, improving discipline in schools and classrooms, an
d putting in place measurable ways to make change happen, such as basic skills
exams at different grade levels. They are striking a careful balance between g
iving schools the increased support and flexibility they need to raise achievem
ent levels and, at the same time, holding schools accountable when they do not
measure up to clearly established goals.  We are trying to strike that same bal
ance in our reauthorization proposals.

Our emphasis on accountability in ESEA, and in particular in Title I, seeks to
build on, support, and encourage these growing State and local efforts to pick
up the pace of standardsbased reform. Here it is important to recognize that w
e are not talking about more regulations.  We want better results.  There is bo
th a moral and a fiscal dimension to being more accountable. We cannot afford
to lose the talents of one child, and we cannot waste the substantial resources
 entrusted to us by American taxpayers.

The either/or thinking that has dominated the public debate about our accounta
bility proposals"more Federal control versus less local control"really misses t
he point entirely about what we seek to achieve.   If a State is putting its own
 accountability measures into place, we are not demanding that they replace the
ir measures with our measures.  But if a State does not have such requirements
in place, then it makes a good deal of sense for them to adopt our proposals.
We expect States to do this because it is good education policy and the right t
hing to do for the children.

StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\      P6QXP#Our approach to increased accountability is one of g
raduated response, a range of options"some positive and others more prescriptiv
e"that can help break the mold and get lowperforming schools moving in a more p
ositive direction. On the positive side of the continuum, we give school distr
icts greater flexibility if we see that they are making progress.    But if a sch
001 or a school district simply isnt making things happen, we want to work with
 State and local officials to find out why and shake things up . . The local scho
01 district, for example, may not be giving teachers the real professional deve
lopment time they need.

If a school district is refusing to change, we are prepared to be much more spe
cific about how it uses ESEA funding.  We do not intend to be passive in the fa
ce of failure.  We will help, nudge, prod, and demand action. And, if we have
to, we are prepared to restrict or withhold ESEA funding.
StyleO
We recognize that a complete accountability system should be multidimensional a
nd include high expectations and accountability for everyone in the system. Al
1 of us are responsible for ensuring that all students reach high standards.   T
he accountability measures in our reauthorization proposal will be designed to


(1) help school districts and states provide students with a highquality educati
on, (2) focus on continuous improvement, and (3)hold students, teachers, princip
als, schools, and districts to high standards.

It is important to note that our proposed accountability measures reinforce and
 build on similar provisions enacted in 1994. For example, the underlying stru
cture of the Title,I accountability provisions is sound, and a minority of Stat
es are hard at work emphasizing continuous improvement and holding schools and
principals accountable for results.  Many States, however, have not fully imple
mented the TitleI provisions and have moved only tentatively to make other chan
ges based on high standards and accountability.

We seek to speed up and strengthen the process by requiring States to take imme
diate action to turn around lowperforming schools, to give parents annual repor
t cards, to end social promotion, to improve teacher quality, and to have wellt
houghtout discipline policies in place that make a difference.

        heading 9#XP\    P6QXP#Meeting State Standards
        heading 9
First, we would retain the current Title I requirement 'that States establish as
sessments aligned with State content and performance standards by the 20002001
school year.  States must also define adequate yearly progress for Title I scho
ols and local school districts in a manner that would result in continuous prog
ress toward meeting State standards within a reasonable time frame.
DO
        heading 9#XP\    P6QXP#Turning Around the Lowest Performing Schools
        heading 9
Second, States should take immediate corrective action to turn around the lowes
t performing schools. Currently, there are over 6,500 schools and 1,300 school
 districts designated under Title I as needing improvement. These schools and
districts were placed in school improvement status after making little or no imp
rovement over a period of two years. Many of these schools are still showing n
o improvement despite receiving additional support. We are saying our children
 have spent enough time in lowperforming schools"it is time to take action now.


States should quickly identify the lowest performing schools that are failing t
o show improvement and provide additional support and assistance.   If any schoo
1 continues to show no improvement, States should take bold action such as reco
nstituting the school or closing the school down entirely and reopening it as a
 fresh new school. The Department's 2000 budget request includes a $200million
 setaside in Title I to help jumps tart this process of State and district inter
vention in the lowest performing schools.

         heading 9#XP\   P6QXP#Annual Report Cards
         heading 9
Third, annual report cards at the State, district, and school levels should be
a requirement for receiving ESEA funds.  The report cards should provide invalu
able information on improvement over time or the lack thereof.  They should inc
lude information on student achievement, teacher quality, class size, school sa
fety, attendance, and graduation requirements. Where appropriate, the student
achievement data should be disaggregated by demographic subgroups to allow a gr
eater focus on the gaps between disadvantaged students and other students.#&J\
 P6Q&P#

#XP\     P6QXP#For report cards to make sense they need to be easily understood by
 and widely distributed to parents and the public. As I indicated earlier, whi
le 36 States already require report cards, many parents and teachers from these
 States say that they have never seen them. Our proposal is intended to give p
arents a tool they can use to join the debate over bringing high standards into


 the classroom, to advocate on behalf of their children and their childrens sch
ools, and to work with teachers and principals to make improvements.
StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\       P6QXP#
StyleOI assure you, if parents find out that their children are going to an unr
uly or unsafe school, there will be standingroom only at the next school board
meeting and that can be a very good thing.   If parents discover that test score
s are down at their school but up at a nearby school, they will start asking qu
estions and spark reform.   In short, a good, honest report card gives parents a
 real accountability tool that allows them to make a difference in the educatio
n of their children.

Separately, we have proposed an additional test that can help parents determine
 if their children are measuring up:  the voluntary national tests in 4th grade
 reading and 8th grade math. The independent, bipartisan National Assessment G
overning Board (NAGB) is developing a plan. for this test, in accordance with la
nguage in the Fiscal Year 1999 Appropriations Act.   I ask the Committee to join
 me in looking carefully at this plan when NAGB announces it later in the sprin
g.

        heading 9#XP\    P6QXP#Ending social Promotion
        heading 9
Fourth, all States receiving ESEA funds should end the practice of social promo
tion.  I want to be clear that in calling for an end to social promotion we are
 not encouraging school districts to retain students in grade; instead, we are
asking school districts to prepare children to high standards.#C\        P6QP# #XP\
 P6QXP#That is why we have pushed so hard for programs like Class Size Reductio
n, the Reading Excellence Act, and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers
afterschool initiative, which invest in the early years and help to minimize th
e number of children at risk of retention in grade.

Research indicates that from 10 to 15 percent of young adults who graduate from
 high school and have not gone further"up to 340,000 students each year"cannot
balance a checkbook or write a letter to a credit card company to explain an er
ror on a bill.  In addition, about 450,000 to 500,000 young people drop out of
high school between the 10th and 12th grades.  These are the young people who a
re hurt by current practices. We need to make sure these students are given th
e support they need to succeed.

The Presidents call for an end to social promotion is designed to tell students
 that performance counts, and to encourage districts and schools to take aggre
ssive action to help all students meet promotion standards on time.  States sho
uld target their efforts at key transition points, such as 4th, 8th, and 10th 9
rades, and should use multiple measures, such as valid assessments and teacher
evaluations, to determine if students have met the high standards required for
promotion to the next grade.  States would develop their own specific approache
s to match their unique circumstances.

Strategies to end social promotion include early identification and interventio
n for students who need additional help"including appropriate accommodations an
d supports for students with disabilities.  Afterschool and summerschool progra
ms, for example, can provide extended learning time for students who need extra
 help to keep them from having to repeat an entire grade.

Fifth, States must do more to ensure teacher quality.  States receiving ESEA fu

e our concern about teacher quality, and we want to work with you to address th
at concern.

Less than two weeks ago, we released our first biannual report on Teacher Quali
ty.  In developing this report, we are making a statement that we are going to
keep coming back to the issue of teacher quality again and again. The report t
old us that less than half of Americas teachers feel very wellprepared to teach
 in the modern classroom. Teachers cited four areas of concern: using technol
ogy, teaching children from diverse cultures, teaching children with disabiliti
es, and helping limited English proficient (LEP) students (See Chart 5). This
study really is a cry for help and we need to respondD.D

Plain Text#d6X@DQ@##XP\ P6QXP#Our ESEA reauthorization proposal would begin to
 address these problems by ensuring that States adopt challenging competency ex
aminations for all new teachers that would include assessments of subjectmatter
 knowledge and teaching skills. We would also work to phase out the use of tea
cher aides as instructors in Title I schools, but at the same time encourage pa
raprofessionals to become certified teachers by supporting State and local effo
rts to build career ladders leading to certification. Our proposal will ensure
 that States make significant progress in reducing both the number of teachers
with emergency certificates and the number of teachers teaching subjects for wh
ich they lack adequate preparation.

The issue of improving teacher quality is also of great importance to all of us
 who want to improve the education of children with disabilities. The ESEA is
meant to serve all children and there are growing numbers of children with disa
bilities who have been successfully mainstreamed into regular classrooms. The
ESEA and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act can work together to m
ake a real difference for many more of these children.  The Teacher Quality rep
ort told us that the majority of our teachers do not feel as wellprepared as th
ey should to teach children with disabilities.  We want to work very hard to rna
ke sure that all teachers have the skills and the tools they need to teach thes
e children to high standards.

We made a good start in improving teacher quality last year when Congress passe
d"with strong bipartisan support"the new teacher recruitment and training progr
ams in TitleII of the reauthorized Higher Education Act. Our ESEA reauthorizat
ion plan would build on this success by providing resources to help States stre
ngthen teachercertification standards.  It also will include"in the new Teacher
 Quality and High Standards in Every Classroom initiative"increased investment
in the highquality professional development that teachers tell us they need to
help all students meet challenging new State standards.

          P6QP#DTITLE ID
          P6QXP#
 !Plain Text!I have described some of the key, crosscutting measures for getting
  high standards into all classrooms. Now I would like to outline some programs
pecific issues and recommendations, beginning with Title I, which is the larges
t Federal investment in elementary and secondary education. This $7.7billion p
rogram reaches more than 45,000 schools in over 13,000 school districts.   With
the expansion of schoolwide projects following the last reauthorization, the pr
ogram now serves over 11million students.   In the 199697 school year, 36 percen
t of the children served were white, 30 percent were Hispanic, and 28percent we
re AfricanAmerican.   Seventeen percent of the children served were limited Engl
ish proficient.

Historically, Title I has been the single largest source of Federal funding tar
geted to raising the achievement levels of students in highpoverty schools and


helping to close the achievement gap between these children and their more adva
ntaged peers. The 1994 reauthorization focused on helping children in high pov
erty schools reach the same high standards expected of all students.  In partic
ular, States were required to develop content and performance standards in read
ing and math, with aligned assessments to measure student progress toward meeti
ng the standards.

In looking at the impact of TitleI, we should keep in mind that despite its siz
e and prominence at the Federal level, it represents about three percent of nat
ional spending on elementary and secondary education. Title I is effective onl
y when it works in partnership with much larger State and local resources. Nev
ertheless, Title I can and should do more to assist State and local efforts to
raise the educational achievement level of poor and minority children, and this
 is what we are trying to achieve through our reauthorization proposals.

The 1994 reauthorization improved targeting of resources, expanded the schoolwi
de approach, and strengthened parental involvement. with regard to targeting,
the GAO recently reported that Federal programs are much more targeted than Sta
te programs. On average, for every $1 a State provided in education aid for ea
ch student in a district, the State provided an additional $0.62 per poor stude
nt.  In contrast, for every $1 of Federal funding districts received for each s
tudent, they received an additional $4.73 in Federal funding per poor student.
 We believe targeting works, and we recommend leaving in place the TitleI alloc
ation formula adopted by the Congress in 1994.

The 1994 Act expanded schoolwide programs by permitting schools with poor child
ren making up at least 50 percent of their enrollment to use Title I funds in c
ombination with other Federal, State, and local funds to upgrade the instructio
nal program of the entire school.  Since 1995, the number of schools implementi
ng schoolwide programs has more than tripled, from about 5,000 to approximately
 16,000. Our reauthorization proposal would maintain the 50percent threshold f
or schoolwide programs.

Parents of Title I children are now more fully involved in their childrens educ
ation through the use of parent compacts called for in the 1994 Act.  I want to
 stress that getting parents involved in the process of school reform is often
the spark that makes the difference.  I have been a strong advocate of increase
d parental involvement in education for many years and there is a good reason f
or it.  Parents are childrens first teachers and they set the expectations that
 tell children how hard they should strive to achieve. Teachers tell us again
and again that parents are too often the missing part of the education success
equation.

If you look at the chart entitled Making the Grade, you will see why we are pI
acing such a strong emphasis on developing compacts between parents and schools
 for our Title I children (See Chart 6).  Four years ago, we created the Partne
rship for Family Involvement in Education with 40 organizations. This Partners
hip has since grown to 4,700 organizations and it continues to grow quite rapid
ly. To give you one example of its activities, last month the Partnership sent
 out a detailed guide of best practices on how teachers can work better with pa
rents.

         P6QP#OProposed Changes to Title 10
         P6QXP#
Building on what we have learned since 1994, our reauthorization proposal would
 continue to hold atrisk children in highpoverty schools to the same high stand
ards expected of all children and to link Title I to State and local reforms ba
sed on high standards. We also would continue targeting resources to areas of
greatest need, supporting flexibility at the local level to determine instructi
onal practices, and encouraging more effective implementation of schoolwide pro


grams.

Title I schools would, of course, be subject to the accountability provisions t
hat we would apply to all ESEA programs.   Specific improvements to Title I woul
d include targeting additional resources to help the lowest achieving schools a
nd phasing out the use of teacher aides as instructors in Title I schools. We
also would strengthen the schoolwide authority by borrowing some of the success
ful features of the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration program, such as
basing reforms on solid research about what works. And in response to a key re
commendation of the reading study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences
 (NAS) , we are proposing the use of diagnostic assessments in the first grade t
o ensure the early identification of children with read·ing difficulties.  In ad
dition to these proposals, we are giving serious considerat·ion to phasing in a
setaside within Title I for professional development aligned to standards.

With regard to family literacy, an issue that I know is very important to the C
hairman of this Committee, the Department is considering changes that would fur
ther clarify existing opportunities for using Title I funds to provide family I
iteracy services. Additionally, we may propose amendments to Even Start that w
ould build upon the quality improvement amendments included in the Reading Exce
llence Act.

The Department also is considering proposals to promote high quality profession
al development for early childhood educators and others to help children develo
p better language and literacy skills in the early years.   The NASs reading stu
dy presented strong evidence that children who receive enrichment services focu
sed on language and cognitive development in early childhood show significantly
 higher reading achievement in the later elementary and middle school years.   W
e believe that professional development based on recent research on child langu
age and literacy development"including strategies that could be shared with par
ents"could make a significant contribution toward the goal of ensuring that eve
ry child can read well by the end of the 3rd grade. Our proposal would target
those children most at risk of experiencing difficulty in learning to read by w
orking with early childhood educators in Head Start and Title I preK programs.

Separately, we support the continuation of the Comprehensive School Reform Demo
nstration program, which we believe is generating some good models for improvin
g the effectiveness of the broader Title I program and for strengthening both T
itleI and nonTitleI schools.

The National Commission on Teaching and Americas Future found that the biggest

 Body Text As we move into the next phase of getting high standards into school

 a priority on science and mathematics.

States and districts would also be able to use these funds to meet new ESEA tea
cher quality requirements related to the implementation and improvement of comp
etencybased assessments for initial licensure, the reduction of the number of t
eachers on emergency credentials, and the reduction of the number of teachers t
eaching out of field.

StyleO#C\        P6QP##XP\       P6QXP#Our reauthorization proposal would build on t
arlier efforts by emphasizing a schoolwide approach to drug and violence preven

effective discipline policies, safe passage to and from schools, effective rese

 to Violence) initiative included in the Presidents 2000 budget request.  Our r

 level to support similar emergency response activities.

#endnote text#StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\          P6QXP#Since the creation of Title III in th
 last ESEA reauthorization, the Federal government has helped States and school
 districts make significant progress in bringing technology into the classroom
and making sure that teachers are prepared to effectively integrate technology
throughout the curriculum.

With the support of Congress, the Department has delivered over $1 billion to S
tates through the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund. This investment is helpi
ng to increase the number of classrooms connected to the Internet"just 27 perce
nt in 1997"and has helped decrease the studentcomputer ratio from 38 students p


er multimedia computer to 13 students per multimedia computer.
StyleD
By early March, $1.9 billion dollars in ERate discounts will be provided to the
 Nations schools and libraries.  This means that over the summer, the number of
 poor schools that are connected to the Internet will rise dramatically.  These
 discounts will also provide affordable access to advanced telecommunications a
nd ensure that all of our schools are active participants in the technological
revolution.

To reduce the "digital divide" that could widen the achievement gap between dis
advantaged students and their wealthier peers, we propose to strengthen the tar
geting provisions of the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund.  Just 63 percent 0
f highpoverty schools had connections to the Internet in 1998, compared to 88 p
ercent of lowpoverty schools. The disparity is even greater at the classroom 1
evel, with only 14 percent of classrooms connected to the Internet in highpover
ty schools, compared to 34 percent of classrooms in lowpoverty schools.

Federal dollars are helping to narrow this digital divide.  Highpoverty schools
 received over twoandonehalf times more new computers than their lowpoverty cou
nterparts in recent years. We will make a special effort to address the needs
of rural America, where technologies like distance learning can make a real dif
ference, and to coordinate ESEA technology programs with the Individuals with D
isabilities Education Act Technology Development Program, which expands access
to innovations in technology to students with disabilities.

Body Text#&J\    P6Q&P##XP\      P6QXP# Helping teachers integrate technology into t
eir daily lesson plans will be another special focus.  Currently, only 20percen
t of our teachers feel qualified to integrate technology throughout the curricu
lum. The reauthorization proposal for Title III will focus on supporting State
 and local efforts to improve teacher quality, with a priority for developing p
artnerships between local school districts, institutes of higher education, and
 other entities.

We also want to strengthen our evaluation efforts to find proven and promising
models of how technology is improving achievement that we can bring to scale.

#endnote text#Students with limited English proficiency (LEP) are the fastest g
rowing population served by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  Accord
ing to State educational agency data, the number of LEP students grew 67 percen
t between the 199091 and 199697 academic years.

Growing numbers of LEP students are in States and communities that have little
prior experience in serving them.  For example, between the 199293 and 199697 s
chool years, the LEP population more than doubled in Alabama, Alaska, Florida,
Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, and Tennessee.


The Presidents goal is to hold schools accountable for ensuring that LEP studen
ts can speak and read English after three consecutive years in our schools. We
 are not proposing to cut off services to students after three years.  To the c
ontrary, schools must continue to help students until they become proficient in
 English.

We are equally committed to ensuring that LEP students reach challenging academ
ic standards.in all content areas.  We also want to assure that States and scho
01 districts have the flexibility they need to provide the most appropriate ins


truction for each child.

I told you earlier that we cannot afford to waste the talents of one child. On
e of Americas greatest strengths has always been her diversity of peoples. Tod
ay, immigrants and their children are revitalizing our cities, energizing our c
ulture, and building up our economy. We have a responsibility to make them weI
come here and to help them be part of the American success story.

Our reauthorization proposal for the Title VII bilingual education provisions s
eeks to achieve these goals by emphasizing the same two key strategies we are p
ursuing throughout the ESEA:  improving teacher quality and strengthening accou
ntability.

             To increase teacher quality, for example, all institutions of highe
r education applying for Title VII grants would be required to show that their
teacher education programs include preparation for all teachers serving LEP stu
dents.

#endnote text#Body Text#&J\       P6Q&P##XP\      P6QXP#To strengthen accountability,

 Body Text
LEP students who have been in u.s. schools for less than three years would cont
inue to be included in the Title I assessment system, but after three years rea
ding assessments would be conducted in English.   Schools and districts would be
 held responsible, as part of the larger ESEA accountability provisions, for en
suring that LEP students reach the threeyear English language proficiency goal.

t comes to giving our students a mastery of other languages. There are teenage

#XP\      P6QXP#D
As I travel around the country visiting schools, I continue to see the spark of
 innovation and creativity in many public schools.   Public education is changin
g quite rapidly at the ground level and offering parents many more options in t
he terms of the type of schools their children can attend and the courses they
can take.

This Administration is a strong advocate of public school choice as a way to en
courage and stimulate the creative efforts of school districts to give parents
the opportunity to find a school that best fits the needs of their children.   S
orne discussions about choice suggest that there is choice only outside of publi
c education. Well, that is an assumption that I want to challenge because it r
eally has no basis in fact.

You can go to school district after school district and find schoolswithinschoo
Is, magnet schools, schooltowork initiatives, high schools collaborating with 1
ocal colleges, and option and theme schools that focus in on specialized fields
 like the environment, the visual and performing arts, communications and techn
ology, backtobasics, classical studies, marine science, accelerated learning, t


he international baccalaureate, finance, and medical sciences.

There is a great deal of variety in public education at the local level, from a
Iternative schools to communitybased learning efforts, to schoolswithoutwalls,
to public schools that focus in on the coreknowledge approach to education. T
here are public school districts like Seattle that have a completely open choic
e model and many other school districts that offer intradistrict choice, interd
istrict choice, and controlled choice.  Critics of public education would do we
11 to recognize that many public school districts are far more in touch with pa
rents than they think and are giving parents the choices they seek.

I want to stress that one of the most important choices that parents can make a
bout a childs education is the choice of subjects and not schools. We have a g
rowing body of research showing that courses students choose in middle and high
 school are powerful predictors of success"from mastery of highlevel math to ga
ining entrance to top colleges and universities. The best schools in America"w
hether they are public, private or parochial"all share something in common:  th
ey place a strong emphasis on a rigorous and engaging academic program. This i
s what makes these schools distinctive, and it is what makes them work.

That is why President Clinton has spent six years advocating the idea that by r
aising standards, exciting families about their childrens education, and puttin
g quality teachers into every classroom, we can raise achievement for many, man
y more of our students"and indeed, someday soon, hopefully all of our students.
  That is the best public policy for us to support.  Private school voucher pro
grams affect only a small number of students, divert us from our goal of high s
tandards for all children, and take scarce resources from the public schools th
at serve around 90 percent of Americas children.

 While the Administration strongly opposes efforts to divert public funds to pr
ivate schools through vouchers or similar proposals, we want to encourage the d
evelopment of new choices within the public school system. This is why we work
ed very closely with Congress to reauthorize the Charter School legislation tha
t fosters creativity with accountability.

This year we are proposing a new choice authority that would help us identify a
nd support new approaches to public school choice, such as interdistrict magnet
 schools and worksite schools, and promote a new, broader version of choice tha
t works within all public schools.

We are interested in promoting public school choice programs in which the schoo
Is and programs are public and accountable for results, are genuinely open and
accessible to' all students, and promote high standards for all students. There
 are many successful public schools that can provide models for improving lowpe
rforming schools, and one of our goals must be to find ways to help States and
local school districts to replicate these successful models by leveraging what
 works for our childrens education.

An additional priority for the Administration is to help communities build and
renovate the school buildings they will need to help all students reach challen
ging standards. The General Accounting Office has reported that States and sch
001 districts face over $112billion in repairs to existing schools.  In additio
n, many schools face severe overcrowding as a result of the baby boom echo. Th
e truth of the matter is that America's schools are overcrowded and wearing out
   The average school in America is over 40 years old and we know that school b
uildings begin to deteriorate once they become that old.

StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\     P6QXP#The Administration is proposing $25 billion in bondi


ng authority to finance the construction or renovation of up to 6,000 schools.
 As part of the Presidents tax legislation, the Federal government will provide
 bondholders with tax credits in lieu of interest payments. State and local bo
nd issuers will be responsible for repayment of principal.   In addition, throug
h the reauthorized ESEA, we would make grants to involve citizens in designing
schools that reflect the needs of the entire community. The Presidents 2000 bu
dget would provide $10 million for these grants under the Fund for the Improvem
ent of Education.
StyleO
StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\       P6QXP#Teaching and learning is changing and the schools we
 build need to reflect these changes, and be much more open to the community as
 whole. The generation of schools we build now are going to be around for a go
od 40 to SO years and they ought to be built in such a way that they are true c
enters of community and anchors for livable communities. We have found that en
gaging citizens in the process of planning and designing schools also encourage
s people to save money and share resources.   Placing an elementary school next
to a senior citizen center, for example, can be beneficial to everyone.

encourage you to give careful consideration to our full proposal when it is com
pleted next month, and I look forward to discussing the specific details of our
 plan as your work on your legislation.

The framework for all of our thinking is the clear recognition that the days of
  dumbing down American education are over. We want to achieve up and raise e
xpectations for all of our young people. As I have said so many times before,
our children are smarter than we think.  We can and surely will debate the meri
ts of the policy ideas that we are putting forward today and that is healthy. L
et us find common ground, however, around the idea that we have both a moral an
d social obligation to give the poorest of our young people the help they need
to get a legup in life and be part of the American success story.

StyleO             As I travel around the country visiting schools, I really do
 get a sense that things are happening, that a very strong consensus has develo
ped about what needs to be done to improve our schools. All the elements are c
oming together: a new emphasis on early childhood, better reading skills, high
 expectations for all of our young people, and accountability for results. We
are moving in the right direction and we need to stay the course to get results
 and always remember that the victory is in the classroom.

StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\       P6QXP#            In conclusion, I want assure you that th
e Administration is prepared to work with the Congress to help and support loca
I and State educators and leaders who are striving to raise achievement levels.
   I hope that in the process, a new bipartisan spirit can evolve around educati
on issues. The last few years have been somewhat contentious here in Washingto
n, and we need to give a better account of ourselves to the American people.
