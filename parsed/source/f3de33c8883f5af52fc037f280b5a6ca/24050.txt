                                   PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT GORE:
                                     FIGHTING FOR MORE COPS AND FEWER GUNS
                                                   June 11, 1999

              "We want more police on the street and fewer guns in the hands of criminals and children. They want
              more guns on the street and fewer cops. I think that's the wrong approach for America. "

                                                                                       President Bill Clinton
                                                                                       June 11, 1999

              Today, in a satellite address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, President Clinton expressed concern for
              Congressional legislation that threatens to undermine progress on the war against crime. The House
              version of the Senate-passed gun legislation creates new loopholes at the request of the gun lobby, and a
              Senate bill voted on yesterday zeros out the President's COPS community police program. The President
              urged Congressional Republicans to heed the call of the American people and put the interests of our
              children over that of the gun lobby.

              VOWING TO DEFEAT NEW GUN LOOPHOLES. The President expressed his dismay at House
              Republicans for watering down the gun legislation passed by the Senate last month in an attempt to curry
              favor with the gun lobby. According to news reports, the NRA is claiming that the Republican bill gives
              them 90% of the loopholes they requested. The House version of the bill weakens the Senate-passed
              legislation in that it:

                     redefmes the term "gun show" so that background checks are not required in all cases where a
                      large number of guns are sold, including flea markets;
                     shortens the amount of time given to law enforcement officers to complete background checks;
                     makes it more difficult for law enforcement to trace certain guns sold at gun shows which are later
                      used in crimes;
                     eliminates the requirement that sellers be notified of background check requirements;
                     exempts certain gun sellers from verifying their identity to the gun show promoter;
                     allows federal gun dealers to ship guns directly to unlicensed buyers across state lines; and
                     opens up the entire instant check system to fraud and abuse by requiring immediate destruction of
                      records.

              The President vowed to work hard to defeat the passage of these new loopholes into law.

              FIGHTING FOR MORE COPS ON OUR STREETS. The President expressed his opposition to yesterday's
              Senate vote to zero out his COPS Initiative. COPS, a successful program to put more police officers on
              the streets, has been instrumental in helping communities to cut crime nationwide. Local officials
              and community residents have praised the COPS program for helping to bring down crime and
              make their communities safer. Just last month, the President announced funding for 100,000
              officers for our nation's streets, and the President's balanced budget provides nearly $1.3 billion to
              continue the COPS program to put even more officers on our streets and give them the tools they need
              to make our streets safe.

              BUILDING ON OUR SUCCESS WITH THE RIGHT STRATEGY.                    The President criticized Congress for
              cutting funds for more police while adding new loopholes to our gun laws. He urged Congress instead to
              build on our success in the fight against crime by funding more police and working to keep guns out of the
              hands of children and criminals.
