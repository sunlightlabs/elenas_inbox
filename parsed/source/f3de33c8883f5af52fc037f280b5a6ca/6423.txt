MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

SUBJECT:               Auto Choice

Overview

       The purpose of the memorandum is to provide you information on auto-insurance reform
and the "Auto Choice" legislation introduced last April by a bipartisan coalition of Members of
Congress. Over the last several months, a NEC-DPC inter-agency working group has spent
considerable time analyzing the Auto Choice proposal and putting together other reform options.

         It is the strong view of the working group that the benefits of Auto Choice have been far
overstated and the costs far understated. For example, proponents of Auto Choice argue that it will
reduce insurance premiums by approximately $250 per year for the average driver. Opponents
however point out that states that currently mandate insurance companies to offer no-fault insurance
plans have some of the highest rates in the country (New Jersey, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania) and
that the proposal will benefit bad drivers at the cost of good drivers. In addition, economists argue
that if Auto Choice does induce reduced premiums, more people will drive leading to more
accidents, increased environmental degradation, and greater strain on our infrastructure.

Background

         "No-fault" insurance, in its broadest sense, is defined as any auto insurance program that
 allows policyholders to recover financial losses from their own insurance company, regardless of
fault. In its strictest form, no-fault applies only to state laws that both provide for the payment of
 no-fault first-party benefits and restrict the right to sue. "Pure" no-fault proposals go one step
 further, abolishing the right to sue in the majority of cases.

         Under current state-level no-fault laws, motorists may sue for severe injuries and for pain
and suffering only if the case meets certain conditions. These conditions, known as a "threshold,"
relate to the severity of injury. They may be expressed in verbal terms (a descriptive or verbal
threshold) or in dollar amounts of medical bills (a monetary threshold). Some laws also include the
days of disability incurred as a result of the accident.


Options

       The working group has considered three options. The first is the Auto Choice legislation
introduced by Senators McConnell and Moynihan and Representative Armey. The second is a
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

proposal developed by CEA to achieve the same ends as Auto Choice -- lower premiums -- but to
do so while reducing environmental and human costs. The third is a proposal to attack the major
reason for high insurance costs, fraud.

Option 1: Auto Choice -- Under this proposal, drivers in states who accept the new federal
legislation have a choice between the existing system in their state and a strict no-fault plan (called
'personal protection insurance' (PPI). A driver who chooses the PPI option gets first-party coverage
for economic damages (mostly medical and lost wages), without regard to fault; a PPI driver can sue
or be sued for economic damages above policy limits. PPI drivers cannot sue or be sued for
non-economic damages ('pain and suffering'), although exceptions are made for accidents involving
drug or alcohol abuse. A driver who opts to stay in the state's current tort system must purchase tort
maintenance coverage (TMC) to cover accidents with PPI drivers.

        The Joint Economic Committee estimates that the Auto Choice Reform Act would save
consumers $45 billion per year. According to Senator McConnell, the average driver currently
pays $757 per year for auto insurance -- and the act would cut that amount by about a third ($243
per driver). The plan achieves these supposed savings by trading lower premiums for agreeing to
give up the right to sue for pain and suffering. Currently, drivers who sue after an auto accident
may be awarded an amount to compensate for noneconomic (pain and suffering) as well as
economic (out-of-pocket) damages.



    Reductions in premiums for PPI drivers -- Premium savings come both from the reduction of
    substantial, unnecessary transaction costs such as lawyers fees and the elimination of pay-outs
    for pain and suffering.

    Speedier processing of claims for PPI drivers -- PPI drivers will also have their claims processed
    faster under their first-party coverage than under the current third-party coverage.

    Benefits for low-income PPI drivers -- Low-income drivers who elect the PPI option will
    particularly benefit. The tort system works to the disadvantage of lower income drivers who are
    less likely to be able to afford to wait out costly litigation.

   Could reduce the number of uninsured motorists -- With the reduced premiums offered by PPI,
    some motorists who chose not to insure in a tort system may now be willing to purchase
    insurance.



   More accidents, pollution, and congestion -- The reduction in premiums for those who choose
    no-fault will result in more drivers on the road. More driving means more accidents, pollution
    and congestion. In addition, reduced liability for negligence may result in less careful driving.

   Premiums for safe TMC drivers may increase -- A TMC driver's liability is reduced since PPI
    drivers whom they hit cannot sue them. However, TMC drivers must now insure their own
                                                                   Hll.x.Dump Conversion

    economic and non-economic damages if they are not at fault and are hit by a PPI driver.

   Will there be a real choice? In a competitive market, premiums for bad drivers who switch to
    PPI will fall more than premiums for good drivers who switch. The resulting self-selection of
    bad drivers into PPI will exacerbate the above problem of rising TMC rates for safe drivers. As
    TMC premiums rise, more people will switch to PPI, thus further raising TMC premiums. These
    increases in TMC premiums could effectively remove any real 'choice' between the two
    systems. However, in the three states that currently offer Choice, state regulation prevents the
    competitive rate setting that would produce this self selection and hence 'choice' may be
    preserved.

   Federal/State role. Even though the Auto Choice bill allows states to opt out of the system, it
    nevertheless represents Federal involvement in an area that traditionally has been the
    responsibility of states governments.

Option 2: Per-Mile Premiums -- The CEA has developed an alternative proposal that sought to
achieve the same ends as Auto Choice -- lower premiums -- but with the additional benefits of
reduced greenhouse gases and smog pollutants and less traffic accidents.

        The CEA proposal would amend the Auto Choice to require insurance companies to offer
premiums on a per-mile basis. Per-mile premiums would be charged based on an estimate of miles,
with a rebate or surcharge issued every year after an odometer reading. Odometers could be read at
existing emissions or safety inspections or by firms under contract with insurance companies.
Insurance companies would compete in their per-mile premium, subject to current regulations;
premiums would consequently vary with region, driving record, type of car, and safety features,
much as premiums vary now.



      Saves Lives -- CEA estimates Per-Mile Premiums could save 9,000 lives per year because of
       financial incentive to drive less miles.

      More Savings -- Potential $20 billion in savings on top of Auto Choice savings of $45
       billion.

      Environmental Benefits -- A reduction in driving will reduce emissions of greenhouse gases
       and smog, providing another incentive for the Kyoto Agreement and the EPA PM/Ozone
       rule.



      Driving Tax -- The proposal will be attacked as a tax on gas and driving.

      Odometer Fraud -- Per-Mile premiums will provide individuals with an incentive to commit
       odometer fraud
      Big Government -- Consumers could be upset by the yearly inspection of odometers and
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

       having to pay insurance surcharges if they drive more than they estimated at the beginning of
       the year.

      No Pass Through of Savings -- No guarantee insurance companies will pass on savings of
       either Auto Choice or Per-Mile Premiums.

Option 3: Anti-Fraud Initiative -- A third option is to call for a series of initiatives to combat auto
insurance fraud. According the FBI, fraud is the leading cause of higher insurance premiums (Tom
what did Freeh's study say). Under this proposal, we would announce support for legislation that
would 1) increase penalties on lawyers and doctors who participate in auto insurance fraud claims,
including possibly taking away licenses to practice law or medicine; 2) encourage insurance
companies to install V-Chips into odometers so they could check the mileage of drivers at random
and reduce premiums for those who drive less and increase premiums for those who drive more.



      Politically Feasible -- This option would not probably meet the least political resistance from.

      Incremental Approach -- This proposal potentially could provide savings to consumers
       without radically altering the current system or challenging state control of auto insurance
       regulation.

Cons

      Less Concrete -- This proposal is less concrete and may not appeal to many voters. In
       addition anti-fraud initiatives often do not produce the type of savings that are advertised.

      No Certainty of Savings To Consumers -- There is no mechanism to insure that insurance
       companies pass on savings to consumers.
