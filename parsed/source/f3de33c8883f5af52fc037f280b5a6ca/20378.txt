    PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES HISTORIC PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH GRANTS AT THE
                         DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND
          HIGHLIGHTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S AMBITIOUS AGENDA TO FIGHT
                              PROST ATE CANCER
                                 June 19, 1998

Today, in his Father's day radio address, the President announced the release of$60 million at the
Department of Defense for prostate cancer research. These largest-ever grants will be awarded by DoD
to promising researchers making important contributions to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.
 These efforts will complement exciting developments in prostate cancer research at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH). This year over 180,000 men are expected to be diagnosed with prostate
cancer, accounting for 30 percent of cancer in men, and nearly 40,000 men are projected to die from this
disease (virtually the same number of women who die from breast cancer). The President also renewed
his call on Congress to pass his budget proposals for historic, multi-year increases in cancer research at
NIH and coverage of cancer clinical trials for Medicare beneficiaries. These proposals complement the
President's strong record in the war against cancer. Highlights of the President's ambitious prostate cancer
agenda include:

       Releasing the Largest-Ever Grants at the Department of Defense (DoD) for Prostate Cancer
        Research. The President announced that approximately $22 million in grants for prostate cancer
        are being awarded today and another $37 will be announced in the next month. Before awarding
        these grants, the DoD conducted a multi-month consultative process with prostate cancer experts,
        patients, and advocates to find the best ways to fund encourage top-of-the-line research and
        received over 600grant proposals. The President also announced that DoD is posting the
        recipients of these new grants on the Internet. This new prostate cancer research program builds
        on the widely-acclaimed peer-review breast cancer research program at DoD.

       Proposing Unprecedented Multi-year Increases in Cancer Research at the National
        Institutes of Health. The President's budget includes a historic 65 percent increase in cancer
        research at NIH over the next five years. Since the President took office, research in prostate
        cancer at the NIH has increased by 100 percent to $122 million in FY1999. This year alone there
        are 450 research projects at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) on prostate cancer, including
        prevention research studying the environmental, dietary and other influences on this disease; and
        research to develop more effective interventions and design more effective screening techniques.
        There is also new genetic research in this area, as scientists recently located the first gene that
        predisposes men to prostate cancer. Also, prostate cancer was the first cancer studied as part of
        NCI's recently launched Cancer Genome Anatomy Project, which resulted in the discovery of
        dozens of new genes that may be associated with the development of prostate cancer. NCI will
        support many times that amount to other cancer, human genome, and other biomedical research
        that will help expand out base of knowledge about the diagnosis and treatment of prostate and
        other cancer.
                                                                                     Automated Records Management Syste r
                                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
         Supporting Coverage for Cancer Clinical Trials for Medicare beneficiaries. The President's
          budget includes a three-year, $750 million demonstration to cover Medicare beneficiaries' patient
          care costs associated with certain Federally-sponsored cancer clinical trials. Medicare currently
          does not cover cancer clinical trials. This proposal is particularly important for prostate cancer
          patients because: most of men with prostate cancer are Medicare beneficiaries, as fully 80 percent
          of those diagnosed with this disease are over age 65; the lack of participation of elderly men in
          trials has undermined clinical research for the treatment, prevention, and screening for this disease;
          and given promising new findings in research, NCI expects there may be an increase in clinical
          trials for prostate cancer, creating a need for even more participants.


         Proposing $25 Million to Raise Awareness About Prostate Cancer Prevention, Treatment,
          Screening for Minorities. African-American men have an incidence rate over 30 percent higher
          than white men and a mortality rate over 50 percent for prostate cancer. The President's race and
          health initiative includes $25 million over the next five years at the Center for Disease Control to
          promote awareness about who is at risk for prostate cancer, current screening options, and the best
          treatment options for those who are diagnosed with this disease .. This investment, in addition to
          clinical trials underway at the NIH, will also help determine why there is such variation in the
          prevalence and mortality of prostate cancer.

    These Proposals Build on the President's Strong Record in the War Against Cancer Including:

         Advocating for a Federally-Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. The President has called on
          Congress to pass Federally enforceable consumer health care protections before it adjourns this
          fall. This patients' bill of rights contain a range of protections that are particularly important to
          people with cancer, including guaranteed access to needed health care specialists, continuity of
          care if a health provider is dropped in the middle of treatment, and access to a meaningful internal
          and external appeals process for consumers to resolve their differences with their health
          plans and health care providers. The nation's health care system has changed dramatically,
          with 160 million Americans now in managed care plans. This legislation will ensure that
          whether Americans have traditional health insurance or. managed care, they are assured .
          quality care.

         Pushing for Legislation Preventing Health Insurers and Employers from Discriminating on
          the Basis of Genetic Discrimination. Scientists recently discovered the first gene related to
          prostate cancer and more progress in understanding the genetic basis of this disease is expected in
          the near future. However, progress in genetics has the potential to be undermined by fear of
          genetic discrimination. One study showed that 63 percent of Americans would not take a genetic
          test if their health insurers or employers could get access to the results. To ensure that new
          advances in genetics are used to improve health rather than to discriminate against
          individuals, the President has called for legislation prohibiting the use of genetic screening to
          discriminate in health insurance and employment.

           Enacted New Prostate Cancer Screening Benefit for Medicare Beneficiaries. As part of the
            historic Medicare reforms in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the President signed into law a
           series of new preventive benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, including coverage of prostate cancer
          . screening. Starting in 2000, Medicare will cover prostate cancer screening.
