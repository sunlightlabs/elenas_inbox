FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      APRIL 22, 1998

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT

Tomorrow, Gingrich, Lott, Stevens and Livingston are meeting at lOam to
discuss how to proceed on the Bosnia/Iraq/Disaster Supplemental.  TodayD,s
House Republican Conference meeting was postponed until Thursday.

The ISTEA conference had its opening meeting today.  Shuster, who is
chairing the conference, said he was encouraged that the President did not
mention D&vetoD8 during his statement yesterday.  Domenici spoke for
several minutes reminding everyone of the statutory spending caps, and
emphasizing that the levels of spending in this legislation will require
offsetting reductions in other appropriated accounts, or will trigger a
sequester. Stevens said he takes DomeniciD,s budget concerns very
seriously and noted that although he is on the conference representing
Commerce, there are nine Senate appropriators on the conference
committee.  Stevens also said he hopes the conference can complete its
work by May 1 so it wonD,t be necessary to add a short-term extension to
the Supplemental; although Phil Gramm responded to Stevens that he would
not support a temporary extension and believes that Byrd would also not
support such an extension. The conference will reconvene on Friday, 4/24,
at lOam at Senate EPW.

The Senate Government Affairs Committee held a hearing on the nominations
of Ed DeSeve to be Deputy Director for Management and for Dee Lee to be
the Administrator for the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.  The
hearing was very brief, just over an hour.  No contentious issues were
raised.  Chairman Thompson announced his intent to move quickly on the
nominations.

Also today, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill to
establish a commission to study social security financing with a report in
February, 1999.

Tomorrow, CBO will be providing revised revenue projections to the Budget
Committee.
