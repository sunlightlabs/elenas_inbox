     TEXT:
     I think this is finally settled. Harris agrees that dropping the
     connection to the President and just calling it the Daily Points of Light
     will probably work with Bush. He has some suggestions about how to avoid
     the appeara~ce that we are distancing ourselves from this so Bush won't be
     offended: announcing this at the Bush library dedication, inviting Bush
     and a group of the first winners to the White House during National
     Volunteer Week in April, saying we congratulate the winners. Not sure
     about the invite in April, but I imagine we could figure it out. I assume
     we would want to announce this at the library thing.

     So here's the revised memo for your review, but there's one more catch.
     Phil Caplan wants our memo to also deal with Harris's other memo to the
     President, the one arguing reauthorization should be a high priority.   So
     I've written some text at the end of the attached document that outlines
     our position on that. If the text itself is OK with you, I'll figure out
     with Phil what this thing should look like in terms of format on the 2
     issues -- I assume you don't care about that. But you'll see the final mem
     o before it goes in.

MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

FROM:                 Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:              Harris Wofford's Proposal to Resume Points of Light Awards

Background: Harris Wofford has written to urge that you resume fonner President Bush's
"Daily Points of Light" awards. He proposes to rename the awards the "Presidents' [plural]
Points of Light," with you and President Bush as co-sponsors. Rather than having the White
House take responsibility for selecting and vetting the winners on a daily basis, as was the case
under President Bush, Harris proposes that the Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation
for National Service take on this responsibility. The Knights of Columbus have agreed to fund
the costs of this program for one year.

One factor complicating the decision is that Harris has had extensive conversations with the
Points of Light Foundation and with President Bush himself on this proposal. Apparently Harris
has made it clear that he favors this idea and that the decision rests with the White House.
Harris indicates that President Bush will be deeply disappointed if we d.ecide not to resume the
awards.

One other timing issue is that you are scheduled to attend the dedication of President Bush's
library on November 6. If we decide to reinstate this program, that event would be an
opportunity to announce it, especially given the fonner President's attachment to the Points of
Lig}).t program.

Arguments For:
    Reinstating the awards is an easy way to keep the issue of service and volunteerism
     before the public on a daily basis. It would continue to repair the rift between the
     AmeriCorps concept of service and the more traditional volunteer sector, just as the
     Philadelphia summit did. Also, AmeriCorps members would be eligible for the awards.

      President Bush very much wants the Administration to do this. He will be very
       disappointed if we do not, and he will see it as the White House's decision because of
       Harris' conversations with him.

Arguments Against:
    The benefits of resuming the awards are minimal. Our efforts to reach out to the
     volunteer sector at the Philadelphia summit were so successful that it is not clear what
     this would add. In addition, some would react negatively to such a decision, since the
     original Points of Light program was derided bymany as an empty gesture.

      The daily responsibility of selecting and vetting winners will be time-consuming for
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

      White House staff, and not worth the effort. Although theoretically we could assign
      responsibility for vetting the award winners to the Points of Light Foundation and the
      Corporation for National Service, from a practical standpoint we would probably still feel
      the need to do a legal and/or political check on award winners.

Options:
      Resume the awards as Wofford proposes.

     Decline to resume the awards.

     Recommended Option: Reestablish these awards as the "Daily Points of Light" awards,
      rather than the "Presidents' Daily Points of Light" awards, to be administered by the
      Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation, with no formal connection to the
      President or the White House.

      Harris believes that this plan would be acceptable to former President Bush as long as we
      do not appear to be distancing ourselves from the awards. To that end, he suggests we
      announce this at the dedication of the Bush library, and advise former President Bush in
      advance of our action. He also suggests that we invite a group of the first winners to the
      White House during National Volunteer Week in April, along with former President
      Bush, and that we use inclusive language in talking about the awards, such as "We join
      former President Bush in congratulating the winners." Such actions seem like a
      reasonable compromise on this issue.

                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

        Recommendation on Harris's Reauthorization Memo:

        Harris Wofford also wrote you on October 3 urging that we make reauthorization of AmeriCorps
        a high priority. He argues that we should send the Corporation's reauthorization proposal to the
        Hill before adjoumment this year, with the goal of getting AmeriCorps reauthorized by the first
        anniversary of the Presidents' service summit next April. AmeriCorps has never been
        reauthorized and is now operating without any authorization. Harris argues that we must seek to
        firmly establish AmeriCorps' existence, preferably beyond the end of your term, and that this is
        the best time to do it.

        The Corporation has made strides, particularly since the service summit, in getting Congress to
        support or at least not attack AmeriCorps. This year, for the first time, Congress did not launch
        an effort to eliminate the core AmeriCorps programs during the appropriations process, and it
        appears we will secure funding at last year's levels plus an increment for America Reads,
        although a smaller one that we requested.

        We recommend that we launch the reauthorization in a high-profile way as Harris requests, but
        wait until the final phase of this year's appropriations battle is complete. The VA-HUD
        appropriations bill that is coming to you for signature includes funding for core AmeriCorps
        programs as well as $25 million for America Reads. However, we are still fighting to get more
        funds for AmeriCorps' portion of America Reads as part of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, .
        and we believe it would be prudent to wait until this is resolved. It is possible that Labor-HHS
        will not be settled until just before recess, which would frustrate Harris's goal of sending this
        proposal to the Hill prior to adjournment. Nevertheless it would be prudent to wait.

        As the memo to you on Presidents' service summit follow-up suggests, one option is to launch
        the reauthorization in a radio address right before Thanksgiving, which would come just before
        Powell's summit update on November 25.
