One-pager and Q&A for Thursday COPS announcement are attached for your
review.

Note: COPS made an error on an earlier figure they gave us; counting
tomorrow's announcement, the total funding for NYC is now $400 million, to
fund 5,800 new and redeployed officers.   We have alerted speechwriting to
this change.

Once you've stopped reeling from the magnitude of our federal efforts in
ONE city, please send us your edits.  Thanks!

Announcement

     Today, President Clinton announced that the Justice Department will: 1) provide New
      York City with a $120 million grant to fund 1,600 additional police officers; and 2)
      provide another 620 law enforcement agencies with $118 million in grants to fund an
      additional 1,700 police officers. President Clinton'S COPS Initiative has now helped
      fund more than 70,000 police officers in communities across the country.

Making Our Streets Safe

     100,000 More Police. In 1992, President Clinton pledged to help cities hire 100,000
      more police officers and to expand community policing. He proposed and fought
      for a nearly $9 billion COPS Initiative as part of the 1994 Crime Act. With today's
      announcement, the COPS Initiative will have helped to fund over 70,000 additional
      police officers in more than 10,000 cities. Funding for the President's goal of
      100,000 officers remains a protected priority in the 1997 Balanced Budget
      Agreement.

     Lowest Crime Rates in 25 years. Crime rates have dropped for five years in a row, to
      their lowest levels in 25 years. Since 1993, violent crime has dropped 16% -- and the
      murder rate has plummeted by more than 20%. In city after city, community policing is
      playing a key role in driving down the crime rates.

     New York City: A National Model. Nowhere has the President's COPS Initiative
      made a bigger difference than in New York City. To date, COPS has provided New
      York City with $400 million to hire and redeploy over 5,800 police officers, and crime
      rates have dropped dramatically. In the past four years, crime has declined by an
      estimated 44%, and murder has dropped by 61 %.

A Record o(Success in Fighting Crime

     Tough, Smart Anti-Crime Strategy. President Clinton has worked closely with police,
      prosecutors, and community leaders to give communities the tools they need to cut crime.
       He worked to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by banning 19 deadly assault
      weapons, and preventing more than 300,000 fugitives and felons from purchasing guns
      through Brady background checks. He fought for tougher penalties for violent and sex
      offenders, and more prisons to incarcerate them. And he has pushed to keep schools
      open late, so that kids can be supervised during the high-crime hours after class.

Q.   What are you announcing today?

A.   Today, the President announced that the Justice Department will: 1) provide New York
     City with a $120 million grant to fund 1,600 additional police officers; and 2) provide
     another 620 law enforcement agencies with $118 million in grants to fund an additional
     1,700 police officers. The grants will be provided through the Justice Department COPS
     Office. With today's announcement, the President's COPS Initiative will have
     helped to fund over 70,000 additional police officers in more than 10,000 cities across
     the country.

Q.   If New York City has been so successful in reducing its crime, why are you funding
     so many new officers for their city?

A.   Even though New York City's crime rates continue to decline, Mayor Guiliani and
     Commissioner Safir are clearly dedicated to doing more to bring crime down even further
     and to improve quality of life for their residents. And we are glad that our COPS
     Program has been -- and will continue to be -- one of the tools they are using reach this
     remarkable success in dramatically reducing crime.

     But crime isn't coming down just in New York City. It is declining across the country--
     in large cities and small towns as well. We are committed to helping all cities further
     improve public safety, which is why we are continuing to add officers. Today's
     announcement also includes funding for more than 1,700 officers for another 620 law
     enforcement agencies.

Q.   To date, how much money has the COPS Office given to New York City and for
     what purposes?

A.   Including today's announcement, the New York City Police Department has been
     awarded $400 million in COPS grants to hire and/or redeploy just over 5,800 police
     officers. This also includes about $1.3 million in non-hiring grants to target domestic
     violence and street-level drug dealing, and to promote New York's successful community
     policing model ("Compstat") among other police departments.

Q.   Do you think the COPS Program has had any impact on reducing crime?

A.   Absolutely. Police chiefs and sheriffs throughout the country will tell you that
     community policing has been a crucial element in reducing crime. And while it's clear
     that there are several factors at work -- such as changing demographics and an expanding
     economy -- community policing has been at the center of most local anti-crime efforts.
     supplant local funding for current officers?

A.   By statute, funding for hiring additional officers through the COPS Program cannot be
     used to supplant local funding for existing officers. New York City is aware of this
     requirement, and has assured us that it will comply with it.

Q.   Some recent articles have raised the problem that some police departments will have
     difficulty paying for COPS-funded officers after their federal grants expire. Are
     the police departments required to keep these officers?

A.   Yes. Upon receiving their federal grants, police departments signed agreements with the
     Justice Department to make a good faith effort to retain additional officers when their
     federal funding expires. The Justice Department believes that the vast majority of police
     departments will keep their commitments and retain these officers. Some cities could
     experience changes which may affect their ability to retain their officers; in those
     instances, the Justice Department's COPS Office has committed to work with any agency
     that asks for assistance. In addition, we have a new program for fiscally distressed
     smaller communities (with populations under 50,000) to help them transition at the end of
     their grants.
