TEXT:
This is the draft drunk driving paper for the radio address.  It contains
the information on the proposed rule which Jose' raised at team leaders
this morning.

Since this morning, I found out about yet another possible announcement --
the release of an HHS/SAHMSA first-time study: Driving After Alcohol and
Drug Use.   This has some interesting data, including an estimate that over
46 million drivers used alcohol or drugs within two hours prior to
driving.   HHS is going to confirm tomorrow morning whether they can
release this for Saturday. They sounded pretty optimistic that it could
be done.   I've included language on this for the press paper, in case we
can use the report.   I can also draft up a version without it, in case it
drops out.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Leanne

                          Combating Drunk Driving and Underage Drinking
                                       December 26, 1998

In his radio address to the nation, President Clinton will release the fIDdings of a new study which shows
that within one year, an estimated 46 million American drivers used alcohol and/or drugs within two hours
prior to getting behind the wheel of a car. To address this problem, President Clinton will announce: (1)
the availability of $25 million in Justice Department grants to combat underage drinking; (2) the issuance
of an interim rule by the Department of Transportation to strengthen state efforts against drinking and
driving; and (3) a renewed challenge to Congress to save lives by setting a nationwide drunk driving
standard of .08 blood alcohol content (BAC).

Drinking and driving remains a serious problem

       New survey documents alcohol and drug use among drivers. The President will release the
        fIDdings of a Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) study which estimates that within
        one year, 28% -- 46.5 million -- of the 166 million drivers in the U.S. used either drugs or alcohol
        or both within two hours of driving. The vast majority of the total, 38 million, were drivers who
        drank alcohol within two hours of driving. This first-time study is a collaborative effort by the
        Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAHMSA) and the National
        Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The fIDdings were based on data from the 1996
        National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and interviews with nearly 12,000 drivers.

Taking action to keep our streets safe

       Keeping youth sober and safe. The President will announce that the Justice Department will
        make $25 million available to help states curb underage drinking. About one-third of all motor
        vehicle fatalities involving youths ages 15 to 20 are alcohol-related. The Combating Underage
        Drinking initiative, administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,
        will provide grants to support and enhance the enforcement and prevention efforts of states and
        localities to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors.

       Giving states new incentives. The President will announce the issuance of a new rule by the
        Transportation Department to help strengthen state efforts to combat impaired driving. The interim
        final rule will set forth new criteria by which states can qualify for grants from the Section 410
        Alcohol-Impaired Driving Grant Incentive Program, including: imposing graduated licenses for
        young drivers, testing SAC levels in fatal crashes, and establishing programs to target drinking
        and driving by young adults (ages 21-34). The Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century,
        signed into law by President Clinton this summer, authorizes $219.5 million over 6 years -- a 65%
        increase -- to continue the Alcohol-Impaired Driving Grant Incentive Program.

       Fighting for a tough national impaired driving standard. President Clinton will reiterate his
        challenge to Congress to enact legislation that makes .08 SAC the legal limit for impaired driving
        when it returns next year. It has been estimated that if all states had .08 laws, alcohol-related
        deaths would decrease by 500 to 600 per year. The President supports bipartisan legislation that
        would give states three years to enact .08 legislation, or risk losing highway funds. Sixteen states
        and D.C. have already adopted .08 laws: UT, OR, ME, CA, VT, KS, NC, NM, NH, FL, VI, HI,
        AL, ID, IL, and WA.

   Fewest alcohol-related deaths since 1975. Earlier this year, the Transportation Department
    released data showing that the rate of alcohol-related crashes fell from nearly 41 % in 1996 to
    38.6% in 1997 -- the ftrst time that the rate dropped below 40% and the fewest number of
    alcohol-related fatalities (16,189) since the Transportation Department began record-keeping in
    1975. Since 1982, the number of alcohol-related fatalities has dropped by more than a third.

   Zero tolerance for underage drinking and driving the law in 50 States. In 1995, President
    Clinton fought for and signed legislation requiring states to have "zero alcohol tolerance" laws for
    underage drinking and driving by October 1, 1998, or risk losing highway funds. At that time,
    just 24 states and D.C. had zero tolerance laws. Today, all 50 states have zero tolerance laws on
    the books.

SAHMSA Study

Q.    What were the other findings from this study?

A.    The President will release the findings of a Department of Health and Human Service
      (HHS) study which estimates that 28% -- 46.5 million -- of the 166 million drivers in the
      U.S. used either drugs or alcohol or both within two hours of driving. The vast majority
      of the total, 38 million, were drivers who drank alcohol within two hours of driving.
      Other key findings from the Driving After Alcohol and Drug Use study include:

            Driving after drug use was more common among drivers who were young -- 13%
             for those age 16 to 20 vs. 5% for those age 21 and older;

            An estimated 5% (9 million) of drivers operated a motor vehicle within two hours
             after drug use with or without alcohol;.

            Marijuana was the illicit drug used most often by drivers who drove after drug use
             (used by 70% of those who drove after drug use);

            Driving after alcohol use was more common among males (31 %) than females
             (14%);

            Female drivers age 21 and older who drove after drinking generally had higher
             average blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels than men the same age; and

            Young drivers between the ages of 16-20 were more likely than older drivers to
             report binge drinking (consuming 5 or more drinks) on the most recent occasion
             they drove after alcohol use.

      This first-time study is a collaborative effort by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
      Services Administration (SAHMSA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety
      Administration (NHTSA). The findings were based on data from the 1996 National
      Household Survey on Drug Abuse and interviews with nearly 12,000 drivers.


Underage Drinking Grants

Q.    Can you provide greater detail about the federal funding announced by the
      President?
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

A.    The President announced the availability of $25 million for States to combat underage
      drinking. The program is administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and
      Delinquency Prevention at the Department of Justice. Under the program, each State
      can receive $360,000 to support and enhance their efforts to prohibit and prevent the sale
      and consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors. For example, States can use funds to
      create task forces of state and local law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies to target
      establishments suspected of a pattern of violating State laws, or to create links with
      private efforts to inform both businesses and youths of the consequences of illegal alcohol
      sales and purchases. Five million dollars of the $25 million total will be made available
      for discretionary grants to support similar activities.


Department of Transportation Interim Rule

Q.    Can you provide greater detail on the interim rule and the Section 410 program?

A.    The interim final rule -- which will be published in the Federal Register next week -- sets
      forth new procedures by which States can qualify for Section 410 alcohol-impaired
      driving incentive grants, administered through the Department of Transportation. The
      Section 410 grant program was reauthorized in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st
      Century (TEA-21) signed by the President earlier this year.

      New qualifying programs for Section 410 grants include: graduated licensing for young
      drivers, programs to target young adult drivers (ages 21-34) for drinking and driving,
      graduated penalties for high-BAC drivers, and testing drivers in fatal crashes for blood
      alcohol content. In addition, States can receive Section 410 grants by meeting certain
      performance criteria based on alcohol fatality rates. States may only use grant funds to
      implement and enforce impaired driving programs.

      In addition to revising the eligibility criteria, TEA-21 significantly increased funding for
      Section 410 grants in TEA-21 to $219.5 million over six years -- a 65% increase over its
      previous authorization level in ISTEA.



.08 Blood Alcohol Content


Q.    Why is the President continuing to push for .08 BAC legislation when the Congress
            refused to include the measure in the omnibus highway bill enacted earlier
            this year? Why should the Congress enact .08 legislation with sanctions
            when they just enacted a $500 million incentive grant program to encourage
            states to adopt .08 laws?

A.    While we hope the incentive grants will serve to encourage more states to pass life-saving
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

     .08 laws, they are only a first step. The President believes we must continue to push for
     a measure to help ensure that all 50 states have .08 laws -- and sanctions have been an
     effective tool to accomplish similar objectives. Zero tolerance for youth drinking and
     driving is a good example. Before the President fought for and signed this into law in
     1995, after years of incentive grants, only 24 states had zero tolerance laws. Three years
     after he signed a law which required states to have zero tolerance or risk losing highway
     funds, all 50 states and D.C. now have them. The same thing happened with the
     minimum drinking age, which has been credited with saving thousands oflives. We
     could save an estimated 500 - 600 lives a year if every state had an .08 law -- which is
     why the President refuses to relent on this issue.

Q.   In March 1998, the President signed a directive to Secretary Slater to, among other
     things, make .08 BAC the standard on federal property. What is the status?

A.   The Department of Transportation has been working with affected federal agencies to
     accomplish the President's directive. Department of Interior's The National Park
     Service is in the process of developing a rulemaking to amend its relevant regulation to
     lower the legal limit in park areas to .08 BAC. Similarly, the Department of Defense has
     initiated plans to amend all applicable internal directives and regulations to lower the
     legal limit on military installations. The Joint Service Committee on Military Justice is
     developing legislation to amend their Uniform Code of Military Justice, which provides
     the impaired driving penalties for military personnel. And the U.S. Coast Guard is
     working to establish a .08 BAC standard on our nation's waterways to reduce the number
     of alcohol-related recreational boating casualties.


Q.   Is there any evidence that lowering the limit from .10 blood alcohol content (BAC)
     to .08 BAC has any real effect on reducing the number of alcohol-related crashes?

A.   Yes. To date, four studies have evaluated the effects of .08 BAC laws in the United
     States. Each study has shown that lowering the BAC limit to .08 was associated with
     significant reductions in alcohol-related fatal crashes. One key study of five states that
     lowered their BAC limit to .08 found that drunk driver fatalities were reduced by an
     average of 16%. And a Boston University study concluded that when all states lower
     their BAC limits to .08, alcohol-related deaths are expected to decrease by about 500 to
     600 every year.


Q.   What are some of the most recent statistics on drunk driving?

A.   The most recent comprehensive statistics were released earlier this summer by the
     Department of Transportation, collected by the Fatality Analysis Reporting System
     (FARS). Some of the key findings from the 1997 FARS report include:

           Fewest alcohol-related deaths since 1975. The rate of alcohol-related crashes fell
+                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


                from nearly 41 % in 1996 to 38.6% in 1997 -- the first time that the rate dropped
                below 40% and the fewest number of alcohol-related fatalities since the
                Transportation Department began record-keeping in 1975. And since 1982, the
                overall number of alcohol-related fatalities has dropped by more than one-third.

               Decline in youth killed by drunk drivers. The 1997 FARS data also shows that
                alcohol-related deaths among 15 to 20 year-olds dropped 5%, from 2,324 in 1996
                to 2,209 in 1997.

               Alcohol a large factor in fatal crashes. Alcohol was involved in 7.0% of all
                crashes, but 38.6% of all fatal crashes. Three out of every 10 Americans will be
                involved in an alcohol-related crash some time in their lives.

               States with lowest alcohol related fatalities: Utah had the lowest percentage of
                alcohol-related fatalities (20.6%), followed by New York (27.4%). Kansas and
                Arkansas were the only other states with alcohol-related fatality rates under 30%.

               Modest decline in overall number of fatalities. Fatalities dropped slightly from
                42,065 in 1996 to 41,967 in 1997 -- 98 fewer deaths. The rounded fatality rate
                dropped from 1. 7 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled to 1.6 deaths --
                despite increased travel and higher speed limits. Sixty-three percent of those
                killed on the highways were not wearing seat belts.

    Q.   Why is December Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month?

    A.   Traditionally, December is a month of holiday parties, increased travel, and new Year's
         Eve celebrations. All of these events contribute to more vehicles on the road and more
         impaired drivers. Between 1988-1997, a total of 15,577 people lost their lives in
         alcohol-related crashes during the month of December alone. And while the annual
         number of drunk driving fatalities is 35% less than a decade ago, the number of people
         who are killed in drunk driving crashes is still far too high. During "3D Prevention
         Month", federal, state, and local governments work with safety activists, law
         enforcement, businesses and medical professionals, schools, and others to host thousands
         oflocal activities with a single emphasis: to reduce impaired driving crashes, injuries, and
         fa tali ti es.
