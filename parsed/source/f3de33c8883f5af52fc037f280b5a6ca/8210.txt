          A SERIOUS RISK TO OUR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY

President Clinton is Committed to Making it Simpler for Americans to File Their Taxes,
to Improving the Tax Code, and to Reforming the IRS.
                                 _ President Clinton Has Cut Taxes for
               Middle-Income Working Families and his New Budget Provides
               New Tax Relief for Child Care, Education, and the
               Environment.
                                    Under President Clinton, It Is Easier and
               Simpler for Millions ofAmericans to File Their Tax Returns
               Electronically and Over the Phones; and
                                    The President Signed the Taxpayer Bill of
               Rights into Law and Wants Congress

CUTTING THE DEFICIT, INVESTING IN THE FUTURE, AND OPENING MARKETS ABROAD.
FIVE YEARS LATER, THE ECONOMY IS THE STRONGEST IN A GENERATION..
       The Unemployment Rate Is Now 4.3 Percent. The lowest in 28 years -- and more than 16
       million new jobs have been created.
       First Surplus In A Generation. In 1992, the deficit was a record $290 billion. This year,
       OMB projects the surplus will be $39 billion -- the first surplus since 1969.
       With Lower Interest Rates, Business Investment Has Boomed. Under President Clinton,
       real business investment has increased 12.2 percent per year -- the fastest since John F.
       Kennedy was President.
       Smallest Tax Burden Since 1976. This year -- because ofthe tax cuts signed into law by
       President Clinton -- the typical middle-income family offour will face the smallest Federal
       tax burden in more than two decades (1976).
THE TAX CODE, AND TO REFORM THE IRS.

    Cutting and Simplifying Taxes. President Clinton proposed and signed into law 40 tax
    simplification measures. The balanced budget agreement ensures that 99 percent of homeowners
    will not pay capital gains tax on the sale of their home and over 90 percent of corporations,
    especially small businesses, do not have to worry about the alternative minimum tax.
    Making It Easier to File Taxes. The Administration is aggressively pushing its innovative
    programs to have people file their tax returns simply and easily by computer or telephone. For
    this year's filing season, 18.5 million taxpayers have filed electronically, up 29 percent from last
    year. Another 6 million taxpayers have filed by telephone this year, an increase of 27 percent
    compared to last year. The typical call takes about ten minutes.
    Reforming the IRS. The President signed into law a taxpayer bill of rights and has been urging
    the Congress to send him a responsible IRS reform bill as soon as possible.

REPLACEMENT SYSTEM WOULD BE, IS DANGEROUS AND WOULD CREATE TREMENDOUS

    harm retirement income security. About 60 million Americans and retirees participate in
    employer provided pension plans structured around provisions in the income tax code and about 22
    million have established lRAs.

   Critical Enacted Tax Relief Would Be Threatened. The balanced budget the President
    delivered provides a $500 child tax credit to 26 million families and $1,500 HOPE Scholarships to
    5.8 million students. This proposal places these tax cuts at risk.

   The Uncertainty Created Would Harm Business Investment Decisions. Every plan to
    purchase a piece of equipment or build a factory has tax consequences. The uncertainty about the
    future of the tax system will raise interest rates, slow investment, and cost jobs. Moreover, there
    are over $3 trillion in investment costs that have yet to be recovered. The proposal would make
    future recovery uncertain and would necessitate very complex transition rules.

   The Proposal Would Create Tremendous Uncertainty for Charitable Institutions of all types
    -- churches, cultural institutions, medical research institutes, colleges and universities, and relief
    organizations -- that rely on $80 billion in deductible charitable contributions each year.
FOR MANY IN THE CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY, SUNSETTING THE TAX CODE IS A DEVICE
TO BE USED TO IMPOSE EITHER A NATIONAL SALES TAX OR A FLAT TAX. All ofthese
proposals would either: undermine fiscal discipline and drain surpluses that could be critically
important to saving Social Security first Q! raise taxes on tens of millions of working families.
                                     From a Reckless Scheme

As President Clinton has said:

   "We put in place a three-part economic strategy rejecting these false choices from the past:

      First, restoring fiscal discipline and conquering the deficits that hobbled growth, spiked
       interest rates, and robbed our economy of capital for investment throughout the 1980s.

      Second, investments in our people, in science and technology, in education and job
       training, and health care, so that everyone has a chance to reap the rewards of growing
       prosperity.

      And third, we responded to the global nature of the new economy by opening new
       markets to our goods and services.

   The strategy is clearly working. There is renewed confidence in the American economy. Its
   stability, its strength, its steady growth are the envy of the world." [Speech to Mortgage Bankers
   Association, March 2, 1998]                                                                          ::c >

   Our economy is growing because consumer confidence and business investment are at record
   highs .... What people think is going to happen, as all of you know, in an economy, is just as
   important as what in fact is happening today. Almost every business investment has tax
   consequences. With no ability to predict the consequences, businesses might decide to
   postpone, cancel, or pare back on plans to buy new computers, build a new factory, hire new
   workers. How could you plan, construct, or finance a new apartment complex or shopping
   center if you couldn't calculate the return on investment because you couldn't determine the
   tax consequences?

   Business growth would stall in that kind of uncertainty. And economic uncertainty is no
   friend to families. The scheme to abolish the tax code could threaten nearly every American
   family's best-laid plans for the future." [Speech to Mortgage Bankers Association, March 2,1998,
   emphasis added].
                                        Stand Defending the Economy


   As Chamber of Commerce chief economist Martin Regalia said, "It's more than a little
    dangerous" [Commercial Appeal, 3122/98, emphasis added].

   The Tax Executive Institute, a nonpartisan association that represents approximately 5,000
    in-house tax professionals employed by 2,800 leading companies in the U.S. and Canada, has said:

       the proposals "illustrate the folly of making tax policy by sound bite and should be rejected."

       "a company that otherwise would invest millions of dollars in a multi-year expansion of its
        manufacturingfacilities might well demur if the pending legislation were enacted because of
        uncertainty over whether or how, after December 31, 2001, it would be able to recover its
        costs. (There are an estimated $ 3 trillion in unrecovered costs ofexisting property, and of
        course the current economic expansion is dependent on sustainedfuture investments.)

       Similarly, individuals who would otherwise invest and save toward retirement might pause
        because of uncertainty over how their retirement earnings would be taxed. To repeal the
        Internal Revenue Code without specifYing a replacement system - to exalt the exhilaration
        of 'doing it now' over the necessity of 'doing it right' - is to threaten major disruptions of
        the economy and the lives of the American people." [TEl letter to Chainnan Archer and Roth,
        March 23, 1998, emphasis added]

   The President of the National Association of Realtors, Layne Morrill, denounced the sunset idea as
    "disastrous for American home owners." [Commercial Appeal, 3/22/98, emphasis added].

   Harvey Hirschhorn, a portfolio manager and chief economist at the Chicago-based investment
    house of Stein Roe & Farnham, told Investors Business Daily that: "Ifthe Tax Code
    Termination Act were to pass, the markets would experience significant Volatility," He also said
    that, "there's no question about it. The stock market simply doesn't like uncertainty." [Investors
    Business Daily, 3/24/98, emphasis added].

   On March 5, 1998, Bob Dole said, "I'm not certain about saying we're going to sunset the IRS by
    the year 2001, unless you've got something to put in its place." [Tax Analysts' Highlights and Documents,
    March 6, 1998]

   Joel Slemrod, a tax expert at the University of Michigan Business School, has called sunsetting
    the tax code: "A crazy idea" [The Christian Science Monitor, March 9, 1998].

   Letter from former Commissioners, Democrats and Republicans, of the IRS to Roth and Archer:
    the sunset proposal "does not meet the standards of reasoned and responsible legislation." [Letter
    from fonner Commissioners to Chainnen Roth and Archer, March 19, 1998, emphasis added].
