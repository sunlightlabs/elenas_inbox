                              RESPONSES TO GOODLING                 Hex-Dump Conversion

1.   We don't need another test.

    These tests are very important for students, parents and teachers. They will clearly show
     how well individual students do compared to challenging, widely accepted national
     standards in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math. No other test provides this clear and
     critical information to students, parents and teachers, and there is no other way for
     families that move from community to community or state to state to maintain consistent,
     high expectations in the basics.

2.   Tests don't generate higher academic performance

    Unlike many other tests that students take, these tests will be designed so that teachers
     and students can prepare for them, starting when the child enters school. Teachers will
     have materials that describe clearly what students should know in order to do to master
     the material and do well on the tests. Students, parents and teachers will have sample
     test questions that show what kind of work is expected. Teachers, through their school
     districts, teacher training programs, and colleagues (over the Internet) will have proven
     practices, lesson plans, and materials, that can help students master the knowledge and
     skills called for in the national standards.

    In addition, teacher classroom assessments and local tests given along the way will help
     teachers, school administrators and parents determine which students are on track for
     meeting the standards, which ones need extra help, and what kind of help they need.

    Research and experience show that raising expectations for students lifts student
     achievement, and these tests are tied to high academic standards. In addition, the tests
     will tell us how well students and schools are doing, which ones need help, and what we
     need to do to boost their performance.

3.   National tests are too controversial to implement without Congressional
     authorization

    We welcome Congress as a full partner in the effort to raise standards for all students and
     to provide parents and students national tests in the basic skills. None of us can do this
     alone. We should be working together to raise standards for our students, improve
     teaching and leaming, and give our schools the tools they need to prepare our children for
     the future. And we are actively seeking a role for Congress before the tests are
     implemented.

    The Administration will submit legislation shortly to create an independent governing
     board to oversee and ensure the integrity ofthe tests. We will use the National
     Assessment Governing Board, a group that already exists and that oversees the widely
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

          used National Assessment of Education Progress (a sample test that gives information on
          how the U.S. and over 40 states are doing, but provides no information for individual
          students or their teachers and families).

     4.   New tests can lead to inappropriate and unfair comparisons of schools and school
          districts

         These tests lead to exactly the right kinds of comparisons -- they tell us how well our
          students and our schools do compared to high standards of excellence that define what
          students should know and be able to do in the basics of reading and math. We should
          welcome these comparisons, not fear them.

         We should not presume that any student, no matter where he or she lives or goes to
          school, will do poorly on this test. We must stop perpetuating the cycle of low
          expectations that, in the name of compassion, actually keeps so many young people from
          achieving their full expectations.

         In July, 15 major urban school districts around the country pledged to participate in these
          tests -- not because these districts believe they will excel the first time around, but
          because they know that their students, when challenged and when they receive the proper
          support, can perform just as well as any other students can.

     5.   New national tests can lead to a national curriculum

         Providing a voluntary reading test in 4th grade and a voluntary math test in 8th grade will
          not create a national curriculum. These tests reflect widespread agreement that already
          exists on what students should know and be able to do. States and local communities
          will continue to determine their curriculum, and will use the national tests to focus
          attention on how to improve student achievement in the basic skills.

     6.   Instead of another test, more resources should be sent into the classroom

         We agree that more resources should be sent into the classroom. That is why the
          Administration has supported record investments in education, to help states and
          communities raise standards, train teachers, improve basic skills, and promote the
          effective use of technology in the classroom. The national tests will aid us in better
          understanding where those resources are needed and how they can be wisely spent.

     7.   The federal government is already spending over $500 million just to test students

         This figure is totally incorrect. Approximately 90% of these funds is for the Goals 2000
          program, which improves teaching and learning in local classrooms by helping states and
           school districts raise standards, train teachers, promote the effective use of technology
          and increase parental and community involvement.
