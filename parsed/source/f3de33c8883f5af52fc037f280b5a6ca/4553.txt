 TEXT:
 After several checks, HUD verified their prior "doubling enforcement"
 announcement.

 At the US Conference on Mayors, Sec Cuomo announced that HUD would double
 the number of enforcement action referred to Justice.  (About 200 of the
 1,058 enforcement actions over the last four years were referred to
 Justice).  HUD staff siad that this announcement did not get covered in
 the press on that event.

 Tomorrow's announcement is that HUD will double the total (1,058) number
 of enforcement actions     not just those that are referred to Justice.
 These two "doubling" events seemed close enough to me to make the changes
 that you suggested of (1) putting the grants announcement up front and (2)
 changes the heading to "the President announces HUD will double" as
 opposed to "directed".

 The Qs&As are also attached.==================== ATTACHMENT

                                           Internal Qs &As


     Q.   What is covered under the Fair Housing Act?

          The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, financing or advertising
          of housing based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, family status, or national origin.
          The act applies to almost all housing in the United States. It applies to private landlords
          and property management firms, property owners, federally-assisted housing, public
          housing authorities, realtors, and lenders and insurers of housing.

     Q.   How are violations of the Fair Housing Act handled?

          Persons who believe they are victims of discriminatory housing practices can file a
          complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Fair
          housing investigations are conducted by HUD, state and city agencies working with
          HUD, and private fair housing groups that receive HUD funds. If an investigation shows
          that illegal housing practices have occurred and the parties will not settle, HUD can issue
          civil enforcement charges -- such as the three announced today -- and legal action is
          taken. HUD handles over 12,000 inquiries from potential complainants annually.

     Q.   How many complaints has HUD processed and what was their disposition?

          Since the Clinton administration took office, HUD has investigated 16,325 housing
          complaints, taken enforcement actions on 1,085 cases, reached out-of-court settlements
          on 6,517 cases, and collected $17.8 million in compensation to victims of housing
          discrimination.

     Q.   Why is the President directing HUD to double its the level of its enforcement actions
          against housing discrimination?

          One of the most basic civil rights is the ability to live where you want. Discrimination in
          housing represents a serious barrier to achieving true racial reconciliation in the country,
          If people are kept apart in their homes and neighborhoods, how can we ever come
          together as a nation? Discrimination in housing is illegal and it is wrong. That's why I
          am directing Secretary Cuomo to do everything in BUD's power to ensure that this
          Nation's fair housing laws are enforced.

          Homeownership helps build strong communities, which is why another goal of my
          administration has been to increase the homeownership rate. We cannot achieve that
          goal without ensuring that fair and equal housing opportunity is open to all Americans.
          Over the past four years, more than 34,000 complaints of housing discrimination have
          been made to federal, state and local agencies. It is critical to address these problems,


                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
          and so in the next four years, HUD will double its enforcement actions to ensure that all
          Americans have a full range of opportunities for home ownership.

     Q.   What has been the level of enforcement activity in the past four years? How much
          will enforcement actions increase as a result of this announcement?

          A total of 1,085 enforcement actions were taken during fiscal years 1993, 1994, 1995 and
          1996: during that time 882 charges finding violations of the Fair Housing Act were issued
          and 203 cases were referred to the Department of Justice for enforcement action. Over
          the next four years, at least 2,170 enforcement actions will be taken.

     Q.   How have minorities fared in terms of home ownership over the past few years?

          With the economy going strong and ownership becoming more affordable, many minority
          and immigrant households are buying homes. The Ford Foundation-sponsored study,
          The State of the Nation's Housing: 1997, issued by the Joint Center for Housing Studies
          of Harvard University found that minority and immigrant households account for nearly
          30% of the overall growth in homeownership, and in many areas anchor the first-time
          buyer market. The number of minority households buying homes for the first time
          increased by 994,000 from 1993 to 1996 -- almost 30 percent of the overall increase of
          3.3 million.

          During those three years, 460,000 Hispanic households have become homeowners -- an
          increase of 16.3 percent. African-Americans and other minorities also posted significant
          gams.

     Q.   What does the Fair Housing Initiatives Program(FHIP) do? How are these grants
          used?

          FHIP provides funds to public and private entities carrying out programs to prevent or
          eliminate discriminatory housing practices. Federal funds provide support to private
          non-profit organizations, State and local governments and others to strengthen
          enforcement and enhance compliance with the nation's fair housing laws. While both
          educational and enforcement efforts are funded, the program's main emphasis is the
          support of private non-profit fair housing enforcement organizations that undertake
          testing and other enforcement activities to prevent and eliminate discriminatory housing
          practices.

     Q.   Why is FHIP important to HUD's mission?

          The FHIP represents a significant Federal commitment to fair housing activity and is a
          critical component of HUD' s enforcement of the provisions of the fair housing laws. It
          is the only grant program available within the federal government whose primary purpose
          is to prevent and eliminate discriminatory housing practices. FHIP also promotes local
          partnerships with other public/private entities in addressing fair housing violations.
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


Q.   What types of activities are funded under FHIP?

     Examples of funded activities include:

           investigating complaints alleging discrimination in housing -- including rental,
            sales, lending and insurance;
           testing as a means of detecting different treatment;
           training housing industry groups and others regarding their responsibilities under
            the Fair Housing Act.

Q.   What types of organizations typically receive FHIP awards?
     The majority ofFHIP recipients are fair housing enforcement organizations that provide
     the full-range of fair housing services to the public. FHIP also funds:
            State and local governments;
            disability advocacy organizations;
            legal services organizations;
            cornmunity development organizations; and
            housing industry groups (this year, a National Outreach and Education award is
             being made to the National Association of Homebuilders Research Center).

Q.   What have FHIP rmding levels been in the past? How much has been requested
     for FY 1998?

     FHIP Funding 1991-1997
     1991 $5.8 million
     1992 $8.0 million
     1993 $10.6 million
     1994 $20 million
     1995 $26 million
