Re:    Noodling Around on Excess Profits

Cynthia -

Here is a spreadsheet which presents some preliminary calculations on excess profits. There is
clearly some refining that can be done, but the results are striking. Here is a quick overview of
what I've done here. I'm happy to talk more to provide further details:




      I first increase the price of cigarettes by the set of price increases announced over the past
       15 months by the tobacco industry - 26 cents in a series of steps before the latest 45 cent
       increase. Following Gary Black's analysis, I do not count 6 cents of the price increase
       because this is standard annual price increase. So, on net, the industry is raising prices
       65 cents more than they otherwise would because of the settlement.

      For simplification, I call this 20 cents in 1998 and 45 cents in 1999, even though a bit of
       the 1998 increase came in 1997 and the 45 cent increase came at the end of 1998.

      This calculation therefore assumes that prices will continue to increase to offset inflation
       - that is, the base price has just risen 65 cents, and will continue to rise thereafter to stay
       constant in real terms. This is consistent with history - if anything, cigarette prices have
       been rising in real terms.

      This calculation also ignores any reaction of state taxes or retail margins. Increases in
       either could lead to further volume declines, which would feed back to the ultimate
       calculations through foregone profits. But this should be small.

Volumes

      I use the standard Treasury model estimates of the price elasticity - a semi-log model with
       a price elasticity of -0.45 - to get the reduction in cig demand from this price increase.

Payments

      Payments under the AG settlement, both fixed and volume adjusted, are clearly laid out in
       the settlement documents. I layout each type of payment. For each, 1report whether
       the payment is volume adjusted (V A) and adjusted for the four pre-existing settlements
       (NS).

               But one key issue is timing. I assign settlement payments to the year in which

                                                                             cords Management System
                                                                Automate d Re
                                                                Hex.-Durnp conversion
              them to the previous year, treating them like tax payments. From an economic
              perspective, his approach makes more sense. But, from the perspective of
              actually measuring the profits ofthe industry over a given year, my approach is
              correct - they won't actually make the payments until April 15 the next year.
              This is clearly something that deserves more thought.

      Following Gary Black, I incorporate 500 million/year in lawyers fees. This is actually
       uncertain - it will be the result of arbitration. Gary Black tells me that the industry is
       actually saying this will be more like $1 billion/year.

      Payments under the four existing state settlements are less clear. Gary Black (in his
       November 24 report) reports total payments under the four state settlements, but doesn't
       divide this into volume adjusted vs. fixed. I've made a fairly arbitrary split, by assuming
       that after 1998 the volume adjusted payments are $1.36 billion each year, and the fixed
       part is the difference between this and his total. Clearly, this needs some refinement.

      The volume adjustment factor is just based on declines in volumes from baseline. The
       pre-existing states factor comes directly from the settlement. Using these, I come up
       with total payments due from the industry.

Foregone Profits

      An important component of costs is the fact that profits fall as prices rise and sales fall.
       incoporate this at existing industry margins of 33 cents per pack.

Net Profit Impact

      I then compute total incremental revenues, using the price increases discussed above.
       Subtracting payments from this, I get net profit impacts.

      There is a loss in the first year, as the price increase for 1998 (before the 45 cent rise of
       last month) is not enough to make the fixed payments due this year. But there are gains
       in every other year.

      The gains in 1999 are particularly large, because the volume adjusted payments are small,
       and there is a dip down in fixed payments. I estimate that in 1999 the industry will make
       over $9 billion in excess profits from this price increase.

              Once again, the year-year assessment of profits is very sensitive to how you time
              the payments relative to inflows.

      The gains then get smaller, but remain quite large; they are about $3 billion per year in
       the out years
       are huge in either case. I find that over 25 years the industry makes over $80 biUion in
       excess profits, with a present discounted value of around $34 billion.

Profit/pack

      I then go through an alternative calculation as a check on my results, by doing things on a
       per pack basis.

      I first add up total volume adjusted and total fixed payments separately. I then convert to
       a total payment per pack, adjusting the first type of payment, and not the second, for
       declines in packs.

      I compare this to the price increase, and, after adjusting for foregone profits on a per-pack
       basis, come up with net profit per pack

      Multiplying by number of packs, I get a very similar result to the earlier calculations.

Excess Profits Adjustment

      Exhibit E of the settlement, which describes the volume adjustment, has a provision that
       this adjustment shall be reduced by 25% of any increase in operating income of the
       industry from its base value. I don't know if such a provision exists in the four state
       settlements - for now I assume that it does not.

      It is unclear how well this can be enforced (see discussion below). But I do some
       calculations as well which assumes that it is perfectly enforced, so that I reduce the
       amount of the AG volume adjustment by 25% of the net profit increase.

      These calculations are shown in the remaining columns of the spreadsheet. I first
       measure 25% of profits, and then compare that to the dollar amount of the volume
       adjustment. I reduce the volume adjustment by 25% of profits, if positive, but I don't
       reduce the volume adjustment below zero.

      This adjustment lowers net profits significantly, but they are still huge - over $26 billion
       in net present value over 25 years.

Phillip Morris

       One reason why these profits are so large is the pricing dynamic in the industry: Phillip
       Morris sets the price and others follow. But, Phillip Morris is doing significantly worse
       under this settlement than are the other players in the market, for two reasons:

                 They pay a disproportionate share of fixed costs (68%, as opposed to only 42% of
                 volume adjusted costs)
              dollar terms
      The second spreadsheet goes through analogous calculations for PM, and finds that they
      do indeed do worse - they get significantly less than 42% of the net profits from this price
      increase. Nevertheless, over the long run, they still make significant profits, of at least
      $6.4 billion in net present value.

Comparisons with Gary Black

     Gary Black's November 24th report has similar calculations. He also finds significant
      excess profits, of about 20 cents per pack. But there are a few differences worth noting.

     First, as emphasized above, is a timing difference. Black treats all payments due early in
      year t+ 1 as being effective in year t. This means that he has the industry losing money
      in 97, making money in 98, and making some money in 99, but not as much as I do. In
      the long run, this is not a significant issue. But over the first few years this timing issue
      does matter. If! were you I would consult with Tax Policy about the right way to treat
      this.

     Black also has money for both lawyers fees and payoffs to farmers. For lawyers, he and I
      both assume $500 million, although he has this growing to $750 million in 1999; but the
      bill says a cap of $500 million. For farmers, he is putting in $500 million based on his
      political judgement that the industry will payoff farmers to buy off any Southern
      Congressmen who want federal legislation to help farmers.
