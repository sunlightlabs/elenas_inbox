MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          RAHM EMANUEL
               BRUCE REED

RE:                  MEETING WITH SENATOR FEINSTEIN ON FIREARMS ISSUES


             Senator Feinstein will want to discuss three firearms issues with you that were
recently featured in a week-long LA Times series criticizing the California and federal laws
banning assault weapons. They include: (1) the importation of large capacity ammunition
feeding devices; (2) "copycat" or "sporterized" assault weapons; and (3) enforcing federal
firearms laws at gun shows. This memorandum summarizes these issues and provides some
suggested talking points for your meeting.

I. LARGE CAPACITY AMMUNITION FEEDING DEVICES

           The assault weapons ban generally banned the possession of ammunition clips with a
capacity of more than 10 rounds, but specifically grand fathered those clips that were
manufactured on or before September 13, 1994. Initially, The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (ATF), with guidapce from the Domestic Policy Council (DPC), interpreted this ban to
prohibit continued importation of all large capacity clips -- no matter when they were
manufactured. The thinking being that clips not in the country before the effective date could
not have been lawfully possessed at that time and were, thus, banned from importation.

         Several importers, however, brought suit challenging this narrow interpretation of the
law, and the Department of Justice advised that the ATF/DPC position was not likely to hold up
in court and should be reversed. As a result, in July of 1996, ATF reinterpreted the clip
provision acknowledging that pre-ban clips could be imported, but requiring importers to present
reasonable evidence that clips to be imported were manufactured on or before the ban's
enactment. As of March 1, 1997, approximately 160,000 large capacity clips had entered the
country under 21 approved permits, and another 20 permits were denied for lack of evidence. In
total, 83 one-year permits have been approved seeking to import more than 2 million large clips.
(While there are no definitive numbers about how many domestically produced clips were grand
fathered, it is estimated that there are many millions of existing -- and reusable -" clips that will
last a lifetime.)

       Senator Feinstein opposed the language in the assault weapons ban grand fathering large
and would support legislation to repeal it. This language, however, was inserted in conference
by Representative John Dingell, and Administration officials -- including former Chief of Staff

                                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
          Leon Panetta -- have been reluctant to seek its repeal.

                   The Senator has also suggested that the Administration can, by executive order, further
          restrict the number of large clips imported or increase the number of ATF agents investigating
          the production of clips overseas. We are not optimistic about either of these options. First, as
          previously mentioned, the Department of Justice has already overturned the ATF/ DPC initial
          policy to ban the importation of all large clips. And second, ATF agents have no oversees
          jurisdiction to conduct investigations and can only do so by convention or through mutual
          assistance treaties.

          II. "COPYCAT" OR "SPORTERIZED" ASSAULT WEAPONS

                  The assault weapons ban covers 19 named firearms, duplicates of those 19 by any other
          name and semiautomatic weapons that accept a detachable magazine and possess at least two of
          certain characteristics specifically outlined in the law (e.g., folding stocks, bayonet lugs, flash
          suppressors, protruding pistol grips, etc.). Since passage of the assault weapons ban, some gun
          manufacturers have adapted or "sporterized" their assault weapons to meet the law's criteria. As
          a result, there are guns on the market with either similar names or similar features as assault
          weapons, but that otherwise comply with the terms of the ban. In fact, despite their appearance,
          some ofthese firearms -- such as the Israeli Military Industries Galil -- have been re-engineered
          and are considerably more difficult to convert to fully automatic than their previous versions.
          Nonetheless, a lucrative market still exists for "assault-type" weapons, and some manufactures
          have sought -- either through brand names or appearances -- to continue to target this segment of
          the market.

                 Senator Feinstein believes that we can do more to crackdown on these new "copycat"
          versions of assault weapons. We do not think this is possible without additional authority from
          Congress. This was a limitation of the assault weapons ban that the Administration and
          Congress accepted when we decided to endorse the FeinsteiniDeConcini approach over
          Representative Schumer's, which granted' the Treasury Department the authority to add or delete
          firearms from the prohibited list.

          III. ENFORCING FEDERAL FIREARMS LAWS AT GUN SHOWS

                 Gun shows and flea markets are the last bastion of completely unregulated and
          undocumented firearms transfers. Most participants are private gun owners who do not sell
          firearms for a living and are generally there to buy and sell from each others private collections.
          As such, these secondary sales are generally exempt from most state and federal firearms laws,
          including the 1968 Gun Control Act that gave the Treasury Department the authority to license
          and regulate federal firearms dealers. However, time and time again anecdotal evidence has
          shown that violations of state and federal firearms laws often take place at these shows. And
          Senator Feinstein believes that ATF should police these shows more aggressively, and that it
          should alter its current regulations to allow A TF agents to attend these shows.

                 ATF's current policy -- as of March 16, 1994 -- is that agents must get authorization from
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

     their local Special Agent in Charge (SAC) and have an intended subject or target before they can
     attend a gun show. Prior to this date -- and as a response to congressional hearings on ATF's
     internal policies and procedures -- ATF had an even more restrictive policy that required
     approval from the Washington office before an agent could attend a gun show. This is no longer
     the case, and A TF agents do attend gun shows in the course of investigations and to follow-up on
     tips from legitimate gun dealers. ATF agents, however, do not attend gun shows without any
     leads or information. It is worth mentioning also that ATF inspectors do attend and sponsor
     booths at all of the major gun shows attended by manufacturers and gun dealers.

      IV. SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS

           Senator, I share your concerns with respect to the assault weapons ban and am willing to
            use the full authority of the executive branch to make sure that we do our best to enforce
            the ban.

     .     In fact, on three separate occasions I have taken executive action to crackdown on assault
            weapons and gun dealers. In August of 1993, I banned the importation of assault pistols
            and toughened requirements for federal gun dealers. And in May of 1994, for foreign
            policy reasons, I banned the importation of firearms from China -- including millions of
            assault-type weapons and large capacity clips.

           Equally important, we have tried to interpret the provisions of the assaults weapons ban
            as strictly as possible, but I understand that we were suited and forced to change our
            position.

           So I think we will need to pass new legislation that expands Treasury's authority if we
            want to ban more guns and more clips -- and you know that will not be easy. But I am
            pleased to ask Rahrn Emanuel, Bruce Reed and our attorneys to take one more look at the
            law and your suggestions, and to see if there is anything more we can do short of
            legislation.

           With respect to gun shows, I think you have hit on an important but difficult issue. We
            have had so much success with Brady, the assault weapons ban and reforming the federal
            firearms licensing system. And gun shows should not be allowed to undermine these
            efforts.

           While it seems that we have little authority in this area, I agree with you that there must
            be more we can do. Again, I would like to ask Rahrn and Bruce to do some research on
            this and see what administrative options are available to us -- to see what more we might
            be able to do in terms of enforcing federal firearms laws at these shows.
