    Re: Privatization Meeting

          Kitty Higgins will be joining us tomorrow a_m. Based on our previous
    conversation and a conversation I had with Gerry Shea, our goal is to begin a
    dialogue with labor about a long term strategy for privatization.

            In addition to the afl-cio staff, the communication workers, auto workers,
    afscme and seiu will be attending the meeting. It goes without saying that their
    first response will be "we are winning the privatization war; the Clinton
    Administration needs to hold firm." In Gerry's view -- and I think we agree --
    "holding firm" is not a long term strategy.

          John and Sec. Herman put on the table a four-pronged approach:

                Say "no" to all privatization;
                Say "yes" to all privatization;
                Say "no" but accommodate a State proposal to privatize but wi merit
                 staffing principles;
                Say "yes" but just pilot.

            Ifwe can engage in a dialogue around the last two options--because I believe
    the first two options do not work--I think we will have made some progress. With
    the last two options, if we could engage in a discussion around the principles that
    labor would like to see us apply, we will have made significant progress.

           Since the reaction from the outset will be defensive and lacking in trust, I
    would like to open with a "why we are here." Then, Bruce and Elena if you would
    give an overview of the issues that are currently before the Administration and the
    ones we expect to come like CHIPS, Medicaid, TANIF. With a bit ofluck, we
    may be able to engage in a dialogue about the best options for handling the debate,
    the process and the substance.

    Thank you.
