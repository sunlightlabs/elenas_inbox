Implementation of the Children's Health Initiative.
      Work with HHS, OMB, and First Lady's office to ensure effective implementation of
       children's health initiative. Work with Governors, private, and advocacy organizations to

       to the three million children who are eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid).
      Design events with the President, First Lady, Secretary Shalala and others to highlight and
       ensure positive implementation of this initiative.

       a constructive collaboration between the Administration, your Quality Commission (their
       consumer protections' recommendations are due out in October), and the numerous
       Members on the Hill (particularly Jeffords, Frist, and Kennedy) who have a keen
       legislative interest in this area.
      Work with HHS to finalize their statutorily-mandated report on privacy protections and
       develop Administration-wide positions on each of these controversial and complicated
       Issue. Consider whether fold genetic screening legislation into any more comprehensive
       privacy initiative.

Genetic Discrimination Legislation.
      Develop legislative strategy to pass legislation introduced earlier this summer to prevent
       health plans from discriminating on the basis of genetic information.
      Work with the Labor Department to introduce legislation that prevents employers from
       discriminating on the basis of genetic discrimination.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
