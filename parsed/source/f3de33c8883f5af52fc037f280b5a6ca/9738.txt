NOTE TO JACK LEW AND BRUCE REED
FROM:     Barbara Chow and Mike Cohen
SUBJECT:  Class Size Proposal

Our proposal makes modifications to the Republican proposal that we recieved last night. We just
learned that Obey's staff does not believe that we should be working in the framework of the
Republican proposal, and believes instead that we should modify our own proposal to address some of
their concerns. We will now start working on modifying our bill to address Republican concerns.

Must-have items:

       o a formula that is targeted, preferably using Title I (as was in the original Republican offer) but
       see fall-back position below. The formula will be very sensitive; we should vet our Fallback
       before offering it.

       o the report card and accountability provisions

       o the changes to the Purpose

       o maintenance of effort

Non-Starter Items that must be deleted because they drain resources from class size funding:

       o local control provision, but see fall-back position below.

       o in the 4th bullet under Uses of Funds, delete "costs associated with teaching children
       identified with special needs"

       o any use of funds for instructional materials

Can Trade Away:

       o in Special Priorities -- delete language we added on "teacher oflimited-English proficient
       students, teachers in subjectare with a shortage of qualified teachers, and teachers in large class
       sizes."

Fall-Back Positions:

      Funding formula -- If the Republicans reject using the Title I formula for State and within State
      distribution, propose using the Title VI formula for distribution to States, and Title I for
      sub-state distribution. This will focus funds within States on higher poverty areas. (Attached)

      Local Control-- If you cannot delete "Local Control", then get it modified to base the
      determination on achievement of an average class size of 18. (Attached)

      Maintenance of Effort -- If our language is not acceptable, we will do a new MOE.

       administrative costs.

Special Priorities

               Children from low income families; and
               Children living in sparsely populated areas.)]

education agencies.

       under Part D;

       b) teachers in each other grade and subject area for which funds under Part Dare
       expended; and
