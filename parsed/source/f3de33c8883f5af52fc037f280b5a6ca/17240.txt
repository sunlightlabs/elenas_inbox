      FACT SHEET: PRESIDENT CLINTON'S LINE ITEM VETO OF PROJECTS IN THE
              FY 1998 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT
                                OCTOBER 6, 1997


         38 Projects Cancelled. Today, President Clinton announced that he will line item veto
          38 projects in the Military Construction Appropriations Act of 1998 using the authority
          given him in the Line Item Veto Act.

         Saving Taxpayers Nearly $290 Billion. The President's action will reduce budget
          authority by $287 million in fiscal 1998.

         Bill Included 145 Projects Not Requested by the President. The Military
          Construction Act included funding for 145 projects that were not requested by the
          President in his 1998 Budget.

                 -- The Administration has carefully reviewed those unrequested projects and has
                 concluded that while a majority of them have merit, a number of them do not.

         The President Is Using His Authority to Veto Projects that Meet All ofthe Following
          Three Criteria:

                 (1)     The project was not requested in the President's FY 1998 Budget;
                 (2)     The project would not substantially improve the quality of life of military
                         service members and their families; and
                 (3)     The project is unlikely to begin construction in FY 98 since the
                         Department of Defense reports that no design work has been done on it.

         The President's Action Will Do Nothing to Undercut Our National Security, The
          Readiness of our Forces or their Operations in Defense of our Nation.

                Based on these criteria, the President left over 400 projects in the Military
                 Construction Appropriations Act, including 107 added by the Congress, reflecting
                 his commitment to the quality of life of the forces and their families and his
                 understanding of Congress' role in shaping appropriations bills. In fact, the
                 President's actions accept a net of over $500 million in military construction
                 funding he did not request.

         Under the Line Item Veto Act, which was signed into law on April 9, 1996, the President
          is authorized to cancel tax and spending items ifhe determines that cancellation will:

                 -- reduce the Federal budget deficit,
                 -- not impair any essential government functions, and
                 -- not harm the national interest.

         In addition, the Act requires the President to transmit to Congress a "special message"
          explaining his decision to cancel any tax or spending item pursuant to the Act.
