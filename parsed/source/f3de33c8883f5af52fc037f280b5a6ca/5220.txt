SUBJECT:      Proposed Messages and Agenda for November 19 Advisory Board Meeting

DATE:November 6,1997

        While it is still a work in progress, this memorandum attempts to present our latest
thinking on the November 19 Advisory Board meeting, which will focus primarily on the value
of diversity in higher education. It presents suggested messages that we intend will emerge from
the Advisory Board meeting, a proposed agenda for the meeting, possible presenters, and other
ideas for your consideration. Please provide me with any comments or suggestions as soon as
possible.

I.     Messages to Emerge From Advisorv Board Meeting

        A.    Primary Message: "The Value ofDiversitv in Higher Education"

        Colleges and universities that promote diversity can greatly contribute to improving race
relations in the 21st Century and to creating a stronger, more just, and more united American
community.
        Minority participation in higher education has increased dramaticaUy in the last
several decades. Studies indicate that this increased racial diversity can yield substantial.
educational benefits for aU students. By bringing together students of different
backgrounds, coUeges and universities are teaching students critical lessons about how to
live and work together, and they are exposing students to new perspectives that enrich the
learning environment. Increased minority participation in higher education can also help
overcome racial disparities in society by providing quality education to traditionaUy
undeserved groups.
        In order to realize these benefits of diversity, institutions must be committed to


                                                1
                                                                   l{\;l\"Dump Conversion

change. There are many colleges and universities across America that have developed and
are. continuing to ~wltm P.Il~WJnJl-onlKa~tmp-gttfOSlt줶i'e~~'~~-W~sity.
At Its November WthlJting;-Me'-Adv"ts'o'tyLJJoWwib~쳀t.e valUlisf~i~e~iltil.t
higher education and will identify existing programs, policies, and partnerships that are
promoting the value of diversity on campuses across America.

       B.     Secondary Message: "Continuing Discrimination and Civil Rights
              Enforcement"

         While America has made great progress in race relations, racial discrimination still
exists in various s~ctors of society, and it manifests itself in ways that are sometimes blatant
but more often subtle and hard to detect. Enhanced enforcement of existing civil rights laws
can help eliminate these continuing vestiges of discrimination.

       times are only tentative and will undoubtedly have to ~e adjusted.] .

      have already written such pieces.) This will provide a sense of national support behind
      the presidents who are speaking. It also will help us promote increased participation.

     If possible and beneficial, we recommend that invited guests (i.e., members of the
      Cabinet) sit in with the Advisory Board at each meeting to promote involvement in the
      Initiative.

     We recommend that the meeting be more interactive by having a working lunch with
      invited attendees. Our vision is that each Advisory Board member will anchor a table
      along with presenters, students, faculty, and staff and discuss concrete questions that we
      provide, such as "The Campus Environment: What are colleges doing right to foster an
      appropriate environment for positive cross-racial interactions? What could be .
      improved?" After lunch, one participant from each table (or each Advisory Board
      member) would report back to the Board and the audience with a list of responses to each
      question. (This idea is modeled from a recent event in Fairfax County.)
