MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  BRUCE REED, CYNTHIA RICE, AND DIANA FORTUNA

SUBJECT:               COLLEGE AND WELFARE WORK REQUIREMENTS


You asked about reports that welfare recipients enrolled in college are dropping out or being
asked to drop out in order to go to work and help states meet the welfare law's work
requirements.

As you know, the welfare law marks a change in thinking on how to move people from welfare
to work. Rather than depending on education and training programs to give people skills that
will then translate into jobs, the welfare law relies on research showing that, in most cases, the
surest route to work is to start with a job of some sort. Entry level jobs may then translate into
higher level jobs as skills are acquired in the workplace.

Of course, there are bound to be individuals for whom education is the surest route to a job with
a future. And the welfare law in no way precludes this, nor requires states to tell clients to drop
out of school -- although some jurisdictions, such as New York City, have done so. (New York
City has moved aggressively to require welfare recipients to participate in community work
experience jobs such as cleaning parks. This was done not as a result of the Federal welfare law,
but at the initiative of Mayor Giuliani. As a result, the number of students on welfare enrolled at
the City University of New York has reportedly fallen from 29,000 to 18,000.)

The following are some of the ways in which states can accommodate welfare clients who wish
to stay in school:

      States may choose to exclude some college students from the work requirements.
       To avoid penalties, states must ensure that 25% of the welfare popUlation works at least
       20 hours a week in 1997. This increases over time so that, by 2002, 50% of the welfare
       population must work at least 30 hours per week. The dramatic drop in the welfare
       caseloads is making the work participation rates far easier to meet than expected, since
       states get "credit" toward their work participation rates for the caseload declines.
       Therefore, in the early years ofTANF, most states should be in a position to allow
       currently enrolled students to finish their programs.

      States could encourage recipients to attend vocational post-secondary training,
       which can be counted for up to 12 months in the state's participation rate. Overall, no

                                                                         Automated Records Manage~ent System
                                                                                 Hex-Dilmp Conversion
    vocational training or secondary school, and in many states much of that 20% will be
    made up of teenage parents finishing high school.

   States could put college students in separate state programs to which the work rates
    do not apply. Under the law states could use savings from welfare reform (from
    dropping caseloads or the fact that they need maintain only 75% of historic state spending
    to get the TANF block grant) to set up separate state programs in which they could
    support welfare recipients in college. Currently, work rates do not apply to either 1)
    programs funded by completely separate state dollars or 2) programs funded by
    "maintenance of effort" dollars which states spend in order to get the T ANF block grant.
    We have argued that the work rates should apply to the latter, which is integrally related
    to the federal program, lest states structure their programs to significantly undermine the
    work rates. This change would require legislation. However, even if work rates applied
    to the "maintenance of effort" programs, states could use the savings from welfare reform
    to fund separate state programs for college students.

   College students could work 20 or 30 hours a week and still attend school. Many
    Americans do this: Department of Education statistics show that in 1993,38% of
    undergraduates worked at least 35 hours a week, while 16% worked between 21 and 34
    hours a week. Colleges could make it easier for welfare recipients to combine work and
    college by providing work study opportunities that meet tlie work requirements.
    Although most colleges limit work study to 10 to 15 hours a week, there is no limit in
    federal law -- they can provide as many hours as needed to meet the student's financial
    need. Up to five percent of work study funds may be used in community service
    activities such as tutoring, so it would be possible for a student to fulfill her work
    requirement and remain in college by tutoring in the America Reads program. A student
    could also work 15 hours a week in an on-campus work study job and 15 hours a week in
    a private-sector, off-campus job subsidized by her welfare check.
