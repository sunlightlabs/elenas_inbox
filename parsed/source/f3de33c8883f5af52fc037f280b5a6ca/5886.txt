TEXT:
 A split is developing pushing the moderates to the left, led'by the
Downey group and using Koop as public leverage. Matt Myers suggests
inviting Koop in for a visit so he feels like he is part of our loop and
causes less trouble.  Myers is likely to give a statement soon opposing
legal protections for the industry, he feels he has no choice.

Also,
   An Institute of Medicine study ( a pretty prestigious group on this)
is due out tomorrow supposedly saying a $2 price increase is needed to
reduce teen smokes.

 Conrad's staff is moving ahead on the bill, looking to have a draft by
the 19th. Sticking points include FDA authority and how'to spend the
money.  They would like guidance from us on where we will spend the money
so they can be on the same general page.

 Conrad will use Ford's farmers bill, but Ford is trying to reach an
accommodation with Robb so there won't be a farmer split.

Sum up: I think you should do a meeting with Koop to bring him up to date,
and we should tell Conrad confidentially and closer to the SOTU what
categories the money might go into.
