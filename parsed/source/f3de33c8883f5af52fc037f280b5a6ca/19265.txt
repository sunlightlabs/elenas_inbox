                                    March 30, 1998



        Thank you Mike Barnes for that warm introduction.


        As many of you know, I am not generally the Administration's
spokesperson on issues like tobacco. But I am here today, not only as
the Chief of Staff of this Administration, but as a businessman, as a
North Carolinian, and as a parent, to talk to you about the President's
plan to protect our children from tobacco.


        Consider these facts:


               Smoking kills 430,000 people every year -- it kills more people
                than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and
                fires combined, Smoking is still by far the largest preventable
                cause of premature death in the United States.


               Nearly 90% of smokers started smoking before they turned 18.

                                          -1-
           five years after starting -- yet only one in five actually manages to
           quit.


         Every day, 3,000 young people will become regular smokers, and
           1,000 will die sooner as a result.


     At the same time, multi-million dollar marketing campaigns have
been designed to get our children to light their first cigarettes.


          In the past months, new documents have come to light that
          conclusively prove that tobacco companies aimed to sell their
           deadly products to children as young as 12.


          These documents are a shocking reminder that our children are
          under siege by a deadly and powerful enemy -- and it is up to us to
          protect our children.




                                                -2-

threat of tobacco is right at the top of the President's agenda -- and this
administration is fully committed to working with the bipartisan
leadership in Congress to achieve this goal.


             This is not a matter of politics --- it is a matter of priorities. Many
              Members of Congress from both parties have shown enormous
              leadership on this most important issue.


             Congressman Waxman has been in the forefront of this issue for
              years -- providing the powerful leadership it took to bring us to the
              critical point we have reached today.


             Congressman Bliley has recently done the American people a great
              service by getting thousands of pages of documents from the
              tobacco companies posted on the Internet so all the world can see
              how the tobacco companies have gone after our children.

        worked long and hard to introduce tobacco legislation that this
        Administration can support.


       Senator McCain has provided great leadership in the Commerce
        Committee to draft a bipartisan bill that will move us significantly
        closer to enacting comprehensive tobacco legislation. Everyone
        knows the difficulty of putting together legislation that is so large
        and complex, but Senator McCain has done so in a way that has
        been as open and inclusive as it has been efficient and productive.


       Senator McCain will most likely release his bill later today, and we
        will need to review it in detail before making final judgement.


       Based on what we have seen and heard, I will say this today: We
        expect to see a bill from Senator McCain that will lay a very strong
        foundation for further action, but also has room for significant
        improvement.

      IMPORTANT:


              For example, we do not believe the McCain bill will impose strong
               enough lookback penalties on companies that continue selling
               tobacco to our children.


              We also anticipate seeing some gaps in the bill: the McCain bill
               does not try to comprehensively address the question of how best to
              use tobacco revenues to protect public health and help our children.


              And until issues like these are addressed, we will not consider
               Senator McCain's proposal to give the tobacco companies
               protection from liability. As we have said many times, reasonable
               limits on liability will not be a deal breaker in a bill that meets all of
               the president's principles, but first, we have to get that kind of bill.

     NOTABLE STEPS FORWARD:


             We believe the McCain bill will make significant inroads on youth
              smoking by substantially increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes.


             We believe the McCain bill will also give the FDA the full authority
              it needs to regulate tobacco products, including the authority to
              restrict both the advertising aimed at young people and their access
              to tobacco.


             And the McCain Bill is also expected to contain a strong plan to
            . protect tobacco farmers and their communities.


             We look forward to working with Senator McCain and others in the
              Commerce Committee and the full Senate to strengthen this bill and
              make it an even more effective instrument to reduce youth smoking.

that he believes -- and experience shows -- is the best way to stop young
Americans from smoking before they start. We are pleased that the McCain
Bill will likely include some elements of the President's plan, and we will work
hard to see that the McCain Bill is improved to meet all of the President's goals:


      The President's plan would:


             Raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over 5 years and $1.50 a
              pack over the next ten years, and impose tough penalties on companies that
              continue to sell to kids;


             Affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;


             Get companies out of the business of marketing and selling tobacco to minors.


             Promote public health research and goals; and


             Protect tobacco farmers and their communities.

stop teenage smoking will save 1 million lives over the next five years.


             Last week, Vice President Gore announced that new estimates show
              that our proposal would have major effects on youth smoking in
               every state, with reductions ranging from 33% in Washington State
              to 51 % in Kentucky.


             For every dime added to the price of cigarettes over a 5 year period,
              up to 270,000 fewer teenagers will begin smoking and more than
               90,000 premature deaths will be avoided.


             Price increases alone are projected to reduce teenage smoking over
              the next 5 years by 29%. Youth access and marketing restrictions
               in the President's plan are projected to reduce teenage smoking by
               an additional 11 %.

         plan plus the tighter restrictions on youth access and marketing, will
         reduce the number of youths smoking by 3 million between now
         and 2003 -- and help us avoid approximately 1 million premature
         deaths.




     Tobacco companies must also be part of the solution.


          As the President has said, advertising aimed at adults is legal, but
           tobacco companies must draw the line at our children.


          Our proposal requires tobacco companies to help establish
           smoking cessation programs for adult smokers, and to launch
           public education campaigns aimed at children to keep them from
           smoking in the first place.

is tragic -- and as a businessman, I can tell you that the economic cost to
our society is extraordinarily high.


             Smoking related illness costs approximately $60 billion every
              year -- that's more than the federal government spends on
              education, child care, and medical research combined.


             Smoking during pregnancy results in 2,500 fetal deaths every
              year, and costs $4 billion per year -- this amount is close to
              double what we spend on cancer research each year.


             Fires caused by smokers cost another $500 million every year;


             Smokers die earlier and retire sooner -- and this is estimated to
              cost our economy as much as $80 billion every year in lost output,
              lost productivity, and lost wages.


      These costs rob our economy and cheat the American people out of
their hard-earned tax dollars. But if we pass the President's plan, we will

and most importantly, saving lives.


     We know that this plan will be good for America -- and as a North
Carolinian -- born and raised in tobacco country -- I can tell you that we
must also make sure that we treat our tobacco farmers fairly.


          The President has made protecting tobacco farmers and their
           communities one of the five key elements for his plan for
           comprehensive tobacco legislation.

            public and protecting the well-being of farming communities.
            Recently, a remarkable coalition of farming groups, including
            burley and flue-cured growers, and public health groups,
           including the American Heart Association and the American
            Cancer Society, came together around a shared set of
            principles. That is a consensus we can build on.


          We will use some of the revenue from raising the price of
           cigarettes to make sure that we save our kids without
           devastating our farm communities.      That is a commitment
           this Administration has made, and we are optimistic that a
           consensus is forming in Congress to use some of this money to
            help tobacco farmers.

budget in 30 years. This budget protects our children from the harms
of tobacco -- and our nation from the burdensome costs associated with
teen smoking.           This budget also ~ the very money raised by raising
the price of cigarettes to invest in the future of our nation. Our budget
uses the tobacco money for:

             Critical investments in health research, including biomedical
              research, cancer clinical trials, and children's health outreach --
              increasing by nearly 50% the funding for the National Institutes of
              Health.


             We also make historic investments in child care and after-school care
                -- doubling the number of working families who receive child care,
              and significantly increasing the number of students receiving after
              school care; and lastly,

               size, hiring 100,000 additional teachers, and building or
               rehabilitating 5,000 schools;




     Finally, and most importantly, as a parent of three kids, I can tell you
that when I hear the statistics I mentioned earlier, my blood runs cold.


              When I saw the documents that showed thatJobacco companies
               had deliberately tried to get our children to smoke -- despite the
               fact that a full third of the 3,000 kids who start smoking every day
               will die prematurely -- I knew then and there that we must not rest
              until we have done everything we can to protect our children from
               tobacco.

over the next five years. We must not miss this historic opportunity.


         As President Clinton recently said: "We stand on the verge of one
          of the greatest public health achievements in history -- an historic
          triumph in our fight to protect America's children from the deadly
          threat of tobacco."




         As Chief of Staff of this Administration, as a businessman, as a
          North Carolinian, as a parent, and as an American -- I ask you to
          support our efforts, and to work with us in a bipartisan manner to
          meet this vitally important challenge.


         We must not let protecting our children's lives become an election
          year political fight. It must be a national commitment of the
          highest priority.


     Thank you.
