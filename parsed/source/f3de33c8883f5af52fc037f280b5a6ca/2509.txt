     TEXT:
             Folks:

             I wanted to follow up with some information from today's meeting.

             Below is the text that we are proposing to insert in appropriation's

             language.   You'll note the last sentence says that the programs need

             to be consistent with the principles published in the federal

     register

             by the Secretary.    This means that we do have some flexibility for

             their content, although we are expected to get significant outside

             input via the federal register.        Our counsel's office is still

             assessing whether we would have to go back to the federal register if

             we wanted to make a change down the road.        At this point, they

     believe

             that we would have to go through some formal rule-making procedures.



             I am going to talk to Deputy Secretary Smith about whether he thinks

             we should pursue a stronger enforcement approach to the principles.

             He conceived of them initially, and I am not sure that this was what

             he had in mind, but we can look at some options.



             I am also attaching the document I passed out which was missing a



     page.     It lays out several strategies for responding to the RTI

study.

     Please let me know if your computers can read it (it's in MS WORD.)



     Thanks for your time this morning.      We look forward to discussing

     these items further with you.      (Bill/Dennis- I am not sure I have the

     right email address for Mike or Elena.      Could you make sure they

     receive this note?)



     Thanks,

     Michele

       RESPONSE TO ISSUES RAISED ON DRUG PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS

     The RTI study of drug prevention programs identified several problem areas in program
     implementation (as well as some positive areas.) The issues in this paper are intended to
     address the RTI study as well as information from the recent meeting with prevention
     researchers.

     ED has at least four overarching objectives which could form the basis for our message
     on drug and violence prevention:
            1. Schools need to use research-based approaches that have demonstrated
                effectiveness and eliminate or modify what doesn't work.
            2. Schools need to set measureable goals and objectives to change behavior.
            3. Schools, communities and families need to reinforce each other with zero
                tolerance messages and with messages of hope.
            4. ED needs to do a better job of sharing information about what works.

     In response to the study and conversations with researchers, the Department has identified
     seven areas for improvement:

     1. Increase use of research-based prevention approaches
         A. Improve effectiveness of prevention programming

               FY98 appropriations language puts in place "principles of prevention" that
                will help strengthen the ability of ED to encourage the use of research-based
                approaches. ED will put the principles into the federal register for comments.
               The Safe and Drug Free Schools (SDFS) program will spend $2 million to
                replicate programs that have demonstrated success in smaller, controlled
                settings.
               The SDFS program plans to implement a 5-year, $15 million, demonstration
                project to identify broad-based strategies that work. A team has been put
                together to examine options for the design of this program. This program
                might take the form of a challenge grant.

        B. The RTI study and other studies have stated that approaches to prevention other
           than curricular approaches can have positive impacts. The Department should
           consider approaches which will contribute to the improvement of the overall
           school climate. For example,
            Increase recognition opportunities by reinstating Safe and Drug Free schools
               recognition program
            Focus on initiatives such as peer mediation, mentoring, sfudent courts, class
               size, after school programs
            Promote student compacts to stay drug free


     2. Improve knowledge about what works among various customers

                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
          Planned activities:
          SEAs
           Meet in next 6 months with all SEA drug prevention coordinators and LEA .
             coordinators from large districts to disseminate information and bring researchers
             together with practitioners
          Teachers
           Prepare three issues of Challenge Newsletter to teachers on effective programs (put
             this information into common media used by teachers)
          General public
           Put into federal register information about promising practices?
           Create website with information about what works
           Disseminate publication on what works and doesn't work
           hold teleconference to promote effective programs
          LEAs -- the Department does not do a go<?d job in communicating with them
           Develop listserve to share information and create dialogue among drug coordinators
             at local level

          For consideration:
           ED could establish an independent research organization or board responsible for
             determining what programs have demonstrated effectiveness OR ED could rely on
             research from peer reviewed journals.
           The comprehensive assistance centers (CACs) do not provide assistance in the area of
             drug and violence prevention. The SDFS program hopes to continue funding for the
             National School Safety Center, but this center tends to have a crisis intervention
             approach rather than a strategic technical assistance approach because of its limited
             resources. ED will consider having some of the CACs specialize in the area of drug
             and violence prevention (in addition to their "comprehensive" duties.)

          3. Improve consistency and effectiveness in the delivery of programs
           Teachers often face competing priorities and drug and violence prevention often lose
              air time to more academic work. And when teachers do implement drug prevention .
              programs, they often do not implement a program the way it was designed. In
              addition, they are often inexperienced with the kind of interactive teaching that works
              best for prevention programs. In response, ED is currently assessing the state of
              teacher training programs and exploring options for who, in addition to teachers,
              might successfully deliver prevention programs (outside folks, in-school health
              specialist, etc). The SDFS program has set aside $2 million to respond to the
              information gathered, possibly through a grant program.

          4. Consider targeting at district level
           97 percent of schools receive some funds from the SDFS program which means as
             little as $6-8 per child. States are already required to target extra 30 percent of funds
             to 10 percent of districts. But districts have no targeting requirements. Typically,
             districts spend a significant portion of money on a full or part time drug coordinator.
             The SDFS program will use some of its FY97 national programs money to examine
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

    the question of whether we should target at the district level. The results will be used
    to infonn reauthorization.

5. Increase the amount of planning and evaluation by schools
 Schools and/or districts are not doing a good job of using data to improve practice,
    and in some cases they don't do a good job of collecting the data. The SDFS program
    is planning a $5 million demonstration program to help SEAs and LEAs collect and
    analyze infonnation on drug use and violence in schools and use that infonnation to
    improve practices.

   The SEA/LEA conference hosted by the SDFS program is also designed to address
    this issue. It will have three components: 1) model needs assessment, 2) programs
    that have demonstrated success, 3) how to do evaluation.

6. Change attitudes of acceptance of drugs by youth and parents
 Media campaign by Administration (ONDCP is leading this effort); ED will work to
   ensure our participation early on so that we can amplify the message in schools.
 Parents guide "How to Raise Drug-free Kids" will be distributed to over 18 million
   people and advertised on ABC in March.

7. Improve research base
 Several research organizations (NIDA, NIAAA, OJJDP, NAS, NIJ) are doing
    research related to drug and violence prevention. ED will meet with these groups to
    discuss a longer tenn research agenda. OERI and NCES will be brought into
    discussions to see how they can support research needs.

8. Help improve effectiveness of DARE program
 Federal agencies who fund DARE are meeting to discuss how they can work together
   to make DARE a more effective program.
