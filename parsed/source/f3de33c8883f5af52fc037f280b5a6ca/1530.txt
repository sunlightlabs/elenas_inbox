                          MAMMOGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT

                           DATE:          March 27,1997
                           LOCATION:      Oval Office
                           BRIEFING TIME: 11:30 am - 12:00 pm
                           EVENT TIME:    12:00 pm - 12:30 pm
                           FROM:          Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      You will be announcing several new steps to encourage women to undergo regular
      mammograms beginning at age 40 as recommended by the National Cancer Institute in a
      morning press conference. This will highlight your continued commitment to making
      mammograms more readily available to women of all ages and the Administration's
      ongoing efforts to prevent, detect and treat breast cancer more effectively.

II.   BACKGROUND

      At 10:30am on Thursday, the Presidentially appointed National Cancer Advisory Board
      will announce that they are now recommending mammograms every one or two years for
      women in their forties. At this event, Richard Klausner, the Director of the National
      Cancer Institute, will also announce that he is accepting their recommendations. Since
      1993, the National Cancer Institute has not recommended regular mammograms for
      women in their forties; the decision had been left up to women and their doctors.

      This decision by the National Cancer Institute means there is now consensus in the
      medical community on regular mammogram screening. However, the American Cancer
      Society recommends screening every year and the National Cancer Institute is
      recommending them every one or two years. In practice the National Cancer Institute
      informs us that there will be little to no difference between the recommendations.

      You will be responding to these new recommendations by announcing the following steps
      that will expand coverage of mammograms to women in their forties and to provide
      clearer educational information to women on this issue:

            MEDICARE LEGISLATION - You will announce that as you forward the health
             portion of the balanced budget to Congress on Thursday, the Medicare provisions
             will be amended to include annual mammograms for women age 40 and over.

              (This expansion will be added to refonns already in your budget that improve the
              mammography benefit by eliminating the copayment.)

             MEDICAID
              You will be announcing that the Health Care Financing Administration (HFCA) is
              sending a letter to state Medicaid directors to urge states to provide annual
              mammography screening to Medicaid beneficiaries over age 40, and to assure
              them that HCF A will provide federal matching payments for these screenings

             FEDERAL EMPLOYEES
              You will announce that starting January I, 1988, the Office of Personnel
              Management will require all federal health benefits plans to comply with the
              National Cancer Advisory Board's recommendations on mammogram screenings.

             PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN
              You will announce that the Administration is launching a public education
              campaign to provide information to women about breast cancer screening.
              Secretary Shalala will announce in her remarks that the 1-800-4-CANCER hotline
              will begin immediately to provide infonnation consistent with the
              recommendations of the National Cancer Institute.

             CHALLENGE TO PRIVATE SECTOR HEALTH PLANS
              You will call on the private sector health plans to follow the federal government
              lead to require federal health plans to provide coverage consistent with the
              National Cancer Institute's recommendations.
