              TALKING POINTS ON APPLICATION OF MINIMUM WAGE

       This Administration is committed to moving people from welfare to work. But this
        Administration is also committed to making sure that workers get paid at least the
        minimum wage for their efforts.

       That means all workers -- whether or not they come off the welfare rolls. No one doing
        real work should be paid a subminimum wage.

       You know as well as I that there are complicated legal questions here, involving who
        counts as a "worker" and who as a "trainee" under the minimum wage law.

       But you should know that we will apply the law consistent with its intent -- to protect
        American workers and to make sure that no employer can take advantage of people's
        need.


                     TALKING POINTS ON TEXAS PRIVATIZATION

       You know that we are considering Texas's proposal to privatize substantial parts of its
        Medicaid and food stamp operations.

       We have talked with AFSCME leaders often on this issue, and I know Administration
        officials will talk with you again this week,

       No final decisions have been made. But I can assure you that this Administration will do
        what is best for recipients of public assistance, and that this Administration will look out
        for the interests of the workers who devote their lives to helping those recipients. If the
        Texas scheme is inconsistent with those goals, then we will not permit the State to
        proceed.
