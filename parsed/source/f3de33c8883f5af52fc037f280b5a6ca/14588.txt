MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          GENE B. SPERLING

SUBJECT:       POSSIBLE POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS RELATED TO LABOR ISSUES

DATE:FEBRUARY 12, 1997

        On,February 18, the Vice President will address the Executive Council of the AFL-CIO at
its Winter Convention in Los Angeles. The NEC has met and deliberated the merits of several
possible executive actions and possible announcements oflegislative positions that are of interest
to the AFL-CIO that the Vice President could announce at the convention. Our
recommendations are offered below.

        In general, the AFL-CIO acknowledges the unlikelihood in the near term of significant
legislative changes that would improve labor and employment laws. Indeed, they acknowledge
that their legislative agenda will be largely defensive in the coming months and years. But, as
exemplified here, they seek the Administration's expression of support, in both symbolic and
concrete ways, for the principle that unions have been and still are valuable forces in the
workplace.

1.     Possible amendments to federal procurement regulations.

        Federal law provides that the government should maintain a position of neutrality in labor
disputes between unions and federal contractors. Nevertheless, under current federal contracting
policies, contractors may be reimbursed for the costs of resisting unionization efforts and
defending against unfair labor practice charges, and remain eligible to receive new contracts.

        To address what it perceives as the unfair "tilt" against unions that these federal
contracting policies embrace, the AFL-CIO has asked that the Administration direct the Federal
Procurement Council, which operates under the auspices of the Office of Federal Procurement
Programs within OMB, to initiate a notice and comment rulemaking to amend the Federal
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in three respects. We summarize the actions under
consideration and the pros and cons of each. Since all three go to the unions' neutrality
principle, and since some member of your NEC believed it important to consider them together,
we summarize the Cabinet Departments' recommendations at the end of this section.

       a.     Amend the FAR to cease reimbursement to contractors for costs incurred to
              defend against unfair labor practice allegations that are in litigation.

       The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) currently do not permit federal contractors to
                           Hex-Dump Conversion


be reimbursed for the costs of defending criminal and certain civil proceedings brought by the
government, as well as penalties resulting from those proceedings. In the case of civil
proceedings, reimbursement is disallowed, however, only where a monetary penalty could have
been imposed. Since the National Labor Relations Act does not include monetary penalties, the
current regulations have often been construed to permit reimbursement of defense costs
associated with unfair labor practice proceedings initiated by the General Counsel of the NLRB.

        Proposal: Amend the FAR to make clear that any and all costs relating to defending
unfair labor practice charges and complaints brought by the NLRB General Counsel are now
allowable, both in evaluating bids for fixed price contracts as well as reimbursement for cost
reimbursement contracts

       Pro:    Taxpayers' dollars should not be used to "tilt the playing field" in favor of
               employers against unions and employees. Eliminating this reimbursement will
               bring treatment ofNLRB litigation costs in line with other kinds of litigation
               costs.

       Con: No serious objections or downsides were identified, although a negative reaction
            from government contractors who have been permitted to treat these costs as
            reimbursable is predictable.

       b.      Amend the FAR to cease reimbursement for costs incurred to try to persuade
               employees not to unionize.

        The FAR currently provides that costs incurred by a contractor in maintaining satisfactory
labor relations between the contractor and its employees, including costs of shop stewards, labor
management committees, employee publications, and other related activities, are allowable costs.
 Under this provision, contractors have sought and been reimbursed for activities that undermine
rather than promote satisfactory labor relations. On occasion, the costs that are being paid for
by the taxpayers are for unrelenting and abusive anti-union organizing activity.

       Pro:   Taxpayers should not be subsidizing an employer's efforts to defeat union
              organizing activities and that these activities are now designed, and do not have
              the effect of, "maintaining satisfactory labor relations." A number of other
              statutes explicitly prohibit the use of government funds to promote, assist, or deter
              union organizing activities, such as the Job Training Partnership Act, the National
              Community Service Act, Head Start, and Medicare. Accordingly, there is
              precedent for this kind of provision and auditors having to concern themselves
              with these other statutes have had to determine whether an employer's labor
              relations costs were or were not allowable.

       Con: This provision will require auditors to make decisions about what costs are
            allowable that they are not well equipped to make. In addition, this provision
            will likely be viewed by the contracting community as an unnecessary and
            burdensome requirement not otherwise imposed in the private sector.
                            Hex-Dump Conversion


       c.      Amend the FAR to allow government contracting officers to consider, when
               deciding whether a contractor is a "responsible" contractor (a term of art
               under the existing FAR), the bidder's record oflabor and employment
               policies and practices.

        The FAR provides that a prospective government contractor must be found to be a
"responsible contractor" before being awarded a government contact. "Responsibility" requires
that a prospective contractor be capable of performing the contract, that it has a satisfactory
performance record, and that it has satisfactory "integrity and business ethics".

         Under current practice, a prospective contractor may have engaged in egregious activities
relating to labor or employment practices and still be eligible to receive federal contracts. These
activities currently do not call into question any aspect of the prospective contractor's
responsibility. In some cases, the egregious activities may have been adjudicated and found
illegal, but more commonly, there are no such final adjudications of violations, and there are
instead pending charges -- sometimes hundreds of them -- that will take time to wend their way
through the administrative process at the NLRB, the EEOC or through the courts. Sometimes
the allegations are never adjudicated; for example, most unfair labor practice complaints are
ultimately settled.

        Proposal: Add to the FAR language indicating that the responsibility determination must
take into account whether the bidder has "a satisfactory record oflabor and employment policies
and practices." (This language parallels the existing provision requiring "a satisfactory record of
integrity and business ethics".)

       Pro:    The existing FAR already allows contracting officers to weigh the bidder's
               "business ethics", its "integrity" and its "capability" to perform the contract.
               Factors that may be considered in assessing capability include "safety" and
               "energy/environmental considerations". Labor relations and employment
               conditions are and equally important and appropriate consideration, and the
               Administration ought to say so clearly in the FAR.

       Con: Evaluating "satisfactory" labor relations and employment conditions is a
            qualitative judgment that contracting officers are not well equipped to make,
            especially where the disputed actions or conditions have not been adjudicated.
            Compliance will also be burdensome for contractors who will have to worry about
            meeting a non-quantifiable standard.

        Positions: Labor recommends that you authorize all three actions. Commerce
recommends that you authorize (a) ("defense costs") but not (b) ("persuading costs") or ©
("responsible contractor" amendments). Commerce believes that persuading costs will be too
nettlesome to implement as a practical matter; contracting officers will not be able adequately to
discern reimbursable activity from non-reimbursable activity. SBA urges that you authorize (a)
but not (c). As to the responsible contractor amendments, SBA urges that the Procurement
                        Hex-Dump Conversion


Council issue interpretive guidance indicating that labor and employment practices and policies
should be taken into account, but that the FAR should not be amended. (This approach was
explored with AFL-CIO, but was deemed by them to be inadequate since such interpretive
guidance has no force oflaw.) OMB concurs with SBA. Treasury recommends that you
authorize (a) and (c), but not (b) for the same implementation reason offered by Commerce.

        Recommendation: I recommend that you authorize all three initiatives. There is no
disagreement as to (a). The second initiative is described by those who oppose it as difficult to
implement, but not impossible. Ifwe go forward with (a) and leave (b) undone, we will be
subject to the reasonable criticism that we are continuing to allow the use oftaxpayers' money
to underwrite anti-union proseletizing even though we have gone to the trouble to eliminate
reimbursement of defense costs. The third initiative, the responsible contractor amendments, is
a reasonable policy choice that puts the Administration clearly on record, through regulatory
amendments that have the force oflaw, that a contractor's practices and policies with respect to
labor and employment are important considerations. Its practical effect will be to afford unions
a "hook" in the regulations to present relevant information to contracting officers about truly
egregious situations involving a pattern of abusive labor and employment practices.

2.      Possible executive order encouraging the use of project labor agreements

          Project labor agreements, also known as "pre-hire agreements," are specially negotiated
  agreements between a project owner or construction manager and one or more labor
  organizations. The agreements are reached at the outset of a project in order to ensure efficient,
  timely and quality work; establish fair and consistent labor standards and work rules; supply a
  skilled, experienced and highly competent workforce; and assure stable labor-management
  relations throughout the term of the project. These agreements have long been used for public
  and private construction projects that involve a large volUme of work, extend over a substantial
  period of time, include a substantial number of contractors, and entail substantial costs. It is
. well established that these agreements are effective and may be lawfully used in both the private
  and public sector for construction industry projects.

         Proposal: Issue an Executive Order that directs Executive departments and agencies
authorized to implement or fund a project for the construction of a federal facility to decide on a
project-by-project basis whether a project labor agreement will promote labor-management
stability; advance the public interest in economical, efficient, quality and time project
performance; and assist project compliance with applicable legal requirements governing health
and safety, equal employment opportunity, and labor standards. The Executive Order would
not require the use of a project labor agreement on any particular project.

        Pro:    Project labor agreement are useful and lawful, but federal agencies may not be
                aware of their availability and have not been using them in a significant way.
                Issuing an Executive Order would make clear that federal contracting agencies
                have this authority and should consider using such agreements in appropriate
                                 Hex-Dump COil version


                circumstances.

         Con: No serious objections or downsides have been identified, although this action, in
              combination with other actions on the list oflabor-related initiatives and
              announcements you authorize could send a signal as to the tone you intend to
              take on labor-management issues.

       Positions: All of the agencies support issuance of an executive order that encourages but
does not require the use ofthese agreements.

         Recommendation: I recommend that you authorize issuance of the proposed executive
order.

Agree _ _                        Disagree_ _                        Let's Discuss- -

3.       Possible linkage of flex time legislation to legislation that expands the FMLA

       The two comp time bills currently being considered on the Hill -- both
Republican-sponsored -- fail to address FMLA expansion, and provide fewer guarantees of
employee choice and fewer protections against potential abuse than your flex time bill, which
was sent to Congress last September.

        The Republican comp time bills do not address the principles you outlined in your flex
time bill. Specifically, the bills do not exclude vulnerable workers; do not include special
protections for workers whose employers go bankrupt; do not guarantee real choice for
employees; among other issues. The Ashcroft comp time bill in particular has provisions that
would effectively eliminate the 40-hour week. The labor movement strongly opposes the
Republican comp time bills, and finds these Ashcroft provisions to be particularly offensive.

        Democrats in both houses have introduced bills to expand the FMLA. Several bills are
consistent with your proposal to expand FMLA for an additional 24 hours for the purposes of
routine medical care for children and elderly parents or school related activities. Predictably,
while most Republicans oppose the FMLA bills, they have support from women's groups and
the labor movement. The Democratic legislative strategy is to try to add these FMLA
expansions to the Republipan bills while criticizing their comp time components.

       The labor movement has requested that the Administration threaten to veto any bill that
does not (1) link FMLA and flex time, and (2) improve the comp time provisions to provide real
choice and real protections for employees (as in your flex time bill).

        Proposal: Establish as the Administration's position that there should be a link between
FMLA expansion and any flex time legislation; that any flex time proposal should address our
principles, as spelled out in your bill from last year (i.e., real choice for employees; real
protection against employer abuse; and preservation of basic worker rights, such as the 40-hour
work week); and that you will veto any comp time bill that does not meet these flex time
                                  Hex-Dump COJlversion
principles.

        Pro:   This position would strengthen the position of congressional Democrats to
               improve the Republican bills; it would be welcomed by constituency groups that
               view the Republican bills as a weakening of employee protection laws; and, since
               this strategy does not threaten a veto if the FMLA expansion is not in a final bill,
               it does not lock you in to a veto of an otherwise acceptable flex time bill.

        Con:   AFL-CIO would prefer that you additionally threaten a veto if the bill does not
               include an expansion ofFMLA.

       Recommendation: I recommend -- along with the NEC members -- the proposal that
you express support for FMLA expansion and flex time and threaten to veto a comp time bill if
your principles are not addressed.
