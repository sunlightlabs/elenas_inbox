                            Statement by the President
                       Announcing White House Conference
                   On Early Childhood Development and Learning


        Today, Hillary and I are pleased to announce that on April 17, 1997, we will host the
White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning: What New Research
on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest Children. Taking place at the White House, the
Conference will spotlight exciting new findings about how our children develop, and explore
how we can make the most of this information to give our children what they need to thrive.

        We hope that this one-day Conference will make the latest scientific research, nearly all
of it supported by the federal government, more accessible and understandable to America's
families. The research clearly indicates the importance of children's first few years to their later
success in school and in life. Hillary has been studying and working on issues relating to early
development for years, and they have always been a priority of this Administration.

        The Conference will examine how we can use this new research in practical ways -- to be
better parents, more informed care-givers and more responsive members of our communities. It
will also explore how this information can be used by all members of our society -- from
corporate executives to pediatricians, from ministers to elected officials -- to help strengthen
America's families.

      Parents desperately want to do right by their children, and we all have a role to play
in making sure they have the tools they need to do the best job they can. We believe this
Conference can make a valuable contribution.
                                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
                       WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON
    EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING: WHAT NEW RESEARCH ON
             THE BRAIN TELLS US ABOUT OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN

    "Learning begins in the first days of life. Scientists are now discovering how young children develop emotionally
    and intellectually from their very first days, and how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing,
    even reading to their infants.... We already know we should start teaching children before they start schooL"

                                                                                       -President Bill Clinton, State of
    the Union Address, February 4, 1997

Today, President Clinton issued a statement announcing the date and themes of the White House Conference on
Early Childhood Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest
Children. The day-long Conference will take place on April 17, 1997 at the White House. The Conference will
highlight how critically important children's experiences before school are to their development and their later
success in school and in life.

The Conference will focus on the practical applications of the latest scientific research on the brain, particularly
for parents and care-givers. Also central to the Conference will be a discussion of the ways all sectors of society,
including the medical, business, and faith communities, child care providers and government, can use this
infonnation to strengthen America's families.

Over the last four years, the Administration has invested heavily in medical research to help us better
understand the importance of the first few years to child development and learning, and in strengthening
efforts that support families and caregivers with young children, including:

         Increased NIH Research Funding 23%. Unlike other research areas, the federal government is
          almost the sole funder of research of children and youth, supporting over 90% of research on children
          and youth. Under the Clinton Administration, funding for NIH research was increased by 23% in four
          years to $12.7 billion this year, supporting much of the research that the April White House Conference
          will explore. The President's FY'98 budget increased NIH funding by another $53 million.

         Enhanced Head Start Participation and Quality and Created the Early Head Start Program for
          Children 0-3. The Administration has enhanced Head Start participation and increased its funding by
          43% over the last four years, and created the Early Head Start program in 1994 to support families with
          children ages zero to three. Head Start provides low-income children and their families with
          comprehensive education, health services, and nutrition. The President's FY'98 Budget further
          increases participation to reach 122,000 more children than when he took office.

         Commitment to Full Funding for WIC. The Administration dramatically increased participation in
          the WIC Supplemental Nutrition Program, providing 7.4 million pregnant women, infants, and children
          with nutrition packages and infonnation and health referrals -- 1.7 million more than when President
          Clinton took office. And his FY'98 Budget plan would achieve his goal offull participation in the WIC
          program by the end ofFY98. Research shows that every $1 invested in WIC prenatal serves saves up to
          $4 in Medicaid costs in the first 60 days after birth. [USDA, 1990 MathematicaPolicy Research].

         Leading National Effort to Raise Immunization Rates. In 1993, the Administration launched a
          national effort to raise childhood immunization rates by reducing vaccination costs for parents,
          improving vaccines and vaccine delivery services, and increasing community education and
          partnerships. Today, childhood immunization rates are at a record high.
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

     White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning:
     What New Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest Children

       Today, the President issued a statement announcing that he and Mrs. Clinton will host the
        White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning: What New
        Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest Children on April 17, 1997, at the
        White House.

       The President and First Lady chose this topic because of how critically important
        children's experiences in their first few years oflife are to their development and their
        later success both in school and in life.

       The Conference will focus on the practical applications of the latest scientific research on
        brain development for parents and care-givers, as well as on ways that all members of
        society can use this infonnation to help strengthen America's families.

[NOTE: The President first announced this Conference in his State of the Union Address:
 "Learning begins in the first days oflife. Scientists are now discovering how young children develop
 emotionally and intellectually from their very first days, and how important it is for parents to begin
 immediately talking, singing, even reading to their infants. The First Lady has spent years writing about
 this issue, studying it. And she and I are going to convene a White House Conference on Early Learning
and the Brain this spring, to explore how parents and educators can best use these startling new
findings. "(State of the Union, 2/4/97)]

Q.      Who will be participating in this Conference?

A.      No fonnal invitations have been issued. The President and Mrs. Clinton will invite
leaders in the scientific and academic communities, leaders in the field of early childhood
development, as well as representatives from various sectors of society, including the business,
faith and medical communities. However, because the Conference will take place at the White
House, space will be very limited. We are exploring how best to involve as many people as we
can.

Q.      If people want to come or be involved, who should they call or write to?

A.      They should write to:

Office of Public Liaison
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20502
Attention: Ann Eder
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

Q.     Is this Conference part of Rob Reiner's 0-3 campaign?

A.      Rob Reiner is working on an important effort -- a National Engagement Campaign -- with
a collaboration of foundations, corporations and media to spread the word about the significance
of the first few years oflife. We believe his efforts will complement the Administration's
efforts and the Conference.


Q.     Is the President going to make a big policy announcement at this Conference?

This Conference builds on the Administration's commitment to children and to early
development. For example, the Administration has increased participation in Head Start,
created Early Head Start for 0-3 year olds, increased participation in the WIC Supplemental
Nutrition Program, and raised the rate of childhood immunization to an all time high.

Most recently, on February 24,1997, the President, through an Executive Memorandum, directed
the heads of executive departments and agencies to report to him in thirty days with a
comprehensive list and assessment of existing and planned projects supported by the federal
govemment that target children in their earliest years oflife. The President also called for
proposals of new initiatives that are consistent with his Balanced Budget Plan, as well created an
interagency working group to share, examine and develop these assessments and plans.

Q.     Doesn't the research on the earliest years oflife suggest that women should stay at home?

No. What the research suggests is that we should support all parents, those who work outside the
home and those who don't. What's most important is that children are surrounded by loving,
nurturing care-givers who understand the importance ofthe first few years oflife.
