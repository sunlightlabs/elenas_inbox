                                          THE ECONOMY REMAINS ON THE RIGHT TRAeRf8ted Records Management System
                        Low UNEMPLOYMENT, STRONG JOB GROWTH, AND LdW'-M~'tJ'W컉
                                                                          August 1, 1997

     TODAY'S DATA SHOW CONTINUED JOB GROWTH WITH HISTORICALLY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

      Unemployment fell to 4.8 percent, as low as it's been in 24 years.
              The July unemployment rate was 4.8 -- its 35th consecutive month below 6 and as low as it's been
               since 1973. The unemployment rate for the second quarter of 1997 was just 4.9 -- the lowest for any
               quarter since 1973. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5. [Source: BLS.]
              The combined rate of unemployment and inflation has been lower under President Clinton than any other
               Administration since Lyndon Johnson was President. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]

      12.9 Million New Jobs.
              During the Clinton Administration, the economy has added 12.9 million new jobs -- a faster annual rate of
               job growth (2.5 percent per year) than any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s. [Source:
               Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey,]
              The economy has added 2.7 million jobs over the past year.

      Strong Private-Sector Job Growth.
            Over the past year, the private sector has added 2.4 million jobs -- much more than during the entire
             four-year period before President Clinton took office. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]
            93 percent of the 12.5 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector. [Source: Based on
             data from BLS.]


        Turning The Corner In Basic American Industries.
            After losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous four years, 1.1 million new construction jobs
             have been added since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S
             Truman was President.
            After losing 35,000 jobs in the auto industry during the Bush years, we have 127,000 new auto jobs since
             President Clinton took office. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]

     YESTERDAY, WE LEARNED THAT THE ECONOMY GREW BY 3.5 PERCENT AT AN ANNUAL RATE IN THE
     FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR WHILE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN LOW BUSINESS INVESTMENT HAS
     GROWN BY 11.3 PERCENT PER YEAR SINCE PRESIDENT CLINTON TOOK OFFICE -- THE FASTEST FOR
     ANY ADMINISTRATION SINCE JOHN F. KENNEDY WAS PRESIDENT. THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO
     EXPERIENCE ROBUST GROWTH, STRONG INVESTMENT, AND LOW INFLATION.

     EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG:
      Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 7122/97: "The recent performance of the economy,
         characterized by strong growth and low inflation, has been exceptional--and better than most anticipated."
      David Berson, chief economist, Fannie Mae, 6/14/97: "What we have now is the best combination of
         sustained growth and low inflation that we have had in at least a decade."
      Fortune, 6/9/97: "Business is booming, inflation is falling, jobs are plentiful, and American industry is way out
         in front. The U.S. economy is stronger than it's ever been before."
        Business Week, 5/19/97: "Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion
         over five years, sparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and
         systems that brought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity."
