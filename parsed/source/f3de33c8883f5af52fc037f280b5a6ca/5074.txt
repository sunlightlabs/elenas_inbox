SUBJECT:         Domestic Violence Waivers

Despite our many efforts we have been unable to persuade Senator Murray to embrace our
approach on welfare reform and domestic violence. We recommend against supporting her
proposal in the Labor-HHS conference given that it is at odds with our policy. We believe the
issue would be better addressed through regulation; Secretary Shalala strongly agrees. This
memo provides talking points describing our position and provides a brief comparison of the
domestic violence amendment offered by Senator Murray and the HHS regulations currently
under review.                   .

Talking Points

      We share Senator Murray's goal of allowing states to grant temporary waivers from
       welfare reform rules to victims of domestic violence while ensuring that these women
       receive the services they need to become self-sufficient.

      We disagree with Senator Murray about how best to achieve these goals. We believe
       Senator Murray's proposal would allow states to largely escape the new welfare law's
       work rules and time limits while failing to provide victims of domestic violence with the
       services they need to get on the road to self-sufficiency.

      We support a policy that will encourage states to provide temporary waivers to victims of
       domestic violence and .require that they provide services to these women while
       maintaining the welfare law's strong work focus.

Background

        Senator Murray has long advocated a proposal that would exclude victims of domestic
violence from the welfare work requirements and time limits. The Senate adopted her
amendment as. part of the Senate Labor-HHS bill, which is now in conference. Senator
Murray's proposal has passed the Senate several times, but has always been dropped in
conference. Our Statement of Administration Policy on the Labor-HHS bill does not mention
her amendment. Senator Murray has long been aware that both the DPC and HHS have
serious reservations about her approach to this issue.

        Currently, states can exempt victims of domestic violence from work requirements and
time limits, so long as they put 30 percent of their overall caseload to work and enforce the time
limit for 80 percent of their caseload. Senator Murray's approach would change the law by
allowing states to grant exemptions to these women wholly independently of the overall work and


                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
          time requirements. This approach would significantly weaken the welfare law's emphasis on
          work: for example, if 15 percent of the caseload were granted domestic violence waivers, then
          only 15 percent of the total caseload would have to work. At the same time, Senator Murray's
          proposal would do nothing to ensure that victims of domestic violence actually get the intensive
          assistance they need to become self sufficient; indeed, the proposal might well lead states to
          wholly ignore these톣omen.

                   DPC, OMB, and HHS believe there is a better way to meet our and Senator Murray's
          joint goals, although Senator Murray strongly disagrees. We have been working on regulations
          clarifying that HHS will not subject states to penalties if they fail to meet the work rates because
          they have exempted victims of domestic violence, so long as their exemptions are temporary and
          the state also provides services to help these women become self-sufficient. In particular, the
          proposed regulation will:

                Ensure that domestic violence waivers (1) are based on an individualized assessment,
                 (2) have limited duration and (3) are accompanied by an appropriate services plan
                 designed to provide safety and lead to work. These provisions would help ensure that
                 victims of domestic violence get the assistance they need and that states grant waivers
                 only for individuals who need them.

                Excuse states from a penalty for failing to meet its work participation rate ifthe state
                 meets the rate for the part of its T ANF population that has not been granted domestic
                 violence waivers.

          (Within the Administration there is still some dispute between us and HHS over excusing states
          that grant domestic violence waivers from the 5-year time limit as well as from work
          requirements. We are currently discussing middle ground positions and hope to work through
          this dispute at the stafflevel.)

          Both OMB and DPC believe that the proposed rule we are working on with HHS will result in a
          fair policy which balances our goals of protecting victims of domestic violence and ensuring the
          strong work focus ofwe1fare reform. We believe it is critical that real services be provided to
          victims of domestic violence and that states not be penalized for providing these specialized
          services, but also that states not be given loopholes to escape work requirements or time limits.

          Despite our efforts to address Senator Murray's concerns, we do not expect that she will be
          satisfied with any proposal that falls short of her amendment. However, based on'HHS
          consultation with outside groups during the regulation development process, we do believe that
          many women's advocates will' understand how much our proposal does to help victims of
          domestic violence,
