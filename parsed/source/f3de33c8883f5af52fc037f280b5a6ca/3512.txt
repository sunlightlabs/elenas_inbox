        EXPANSION OF THE YOUTH CRIME GUN INTERDICTION INITIATIVE
                             JULY 19. 1997

BACKGROUND:

    On July 8. 1996. President Clinton directed the Attorney General and
     Secretary Rubin to implement a pilot program in 17 cities to trace as many
     guns as possible. especially those trafficked to kids.

    Under this pilot program. the youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative
     (YCGII). Federal and local law enforcement in each city worked together
     to submit all crime guns seized for tracing and use this information to
     identity and locate illegal gun traffickers.

    Since then. the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco and
     Firearms (ATF) has provided local police departments and ATF special
     agents with specialized training. computers and software - and traced as
     many guns as possible through the National Training Center. Today's
     report details the findings of this effort.

FINDINGS OF TODA Y'S REPORT:

    Confirms kids and guns is a serious problem in all 17 cities. Juvenile and
     youth crime guns account for nearly half (45%) of the firearms recovered
     from crime scenes and criminals.

    Reveals that kids use some of the most concealable and dangerous guns.
       While 80% of youth and juvenile crime guns are handguns -- and 60% are
     semiautomatic pistols. only 70% of adult crime guns are handguns -- and
     less than half. or 47%. are semiautomatics.

    Crime guns used by kids are concentrated among a relatively small
     number of makes and models. The 10 most popular types of crime guns
     account for 25% of all crime guns. In some cities. this percentage is as
     high as 50% for youth or juveniles (e.g . Birmingham. Memphis).

    At least 25% of the crime guns used by kids move rapidly (3 years or less)
     from first retail sale to crime scenes. That means that a significant portion
     of legally purchased guns are quickly and illegally diverted to kids and
     criminals.

    The number of trace requests nearly doubled in the 17 pilot cities. While
     not all traces submitted could be completed. for a variety of reasons.
     overall requests submitted to ATF jumped from about 20.000 to 37,000.

                                                            Automated Records Management System
    HOW TRACING WORKS                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

        The Shikes Case.    Shortly after the YCGII was launched, ATF and the
         Milwaukee Police Department received a tip that an individual named
         "Larry" was selling guns to gang members. This individual was Larry
         Shikes, and he was selling guns from the trunk of his car in the parking lot
         of the grocery store where he worked as a security guard.

         A review of trace information on Milwaukee crime guns revealed that
         Shikes had originally purchased several guns that were recovered in
         connection with youth gang crimes -- including homicides, assaults and
         drive-by-shootings. Shikes illegal activity was further documented by
         undercover purchases of additional shotguns and handguns.

         Shikes was arrested in April 1997. He pled guilty to dealing in firearms
         without a license and providing firearms to convicted felons. He is
         scheduled to be sentenced next month.

    LESSONS LEARNED:

        A new anti-crime Tool.      By submitting Q)l crime guns for tracing, the YCGII
         is showing law enforcement at all levels how young people are getting
         guns. This is critical information that will allow law enforcement to
         prioritize the investigation of gun traffickers.

        Guns are being trafficked to kids. ATF traces and investigations clearly
         show that certain corrupt gun dealers are selling guns to large volume
         traffickers and straw purchasers, who are in turn funneling guns to our
         youth. With more tracing information and enforcement resources, we
         can crackdown on these traffickers and break-up the supply of guns to
         kids and criminals.

        Brady checks Important.     Background checks are needed to help keep
         guns from being illegally diverted. So it's critical that state and local law
         enforcement continue their commitment to Brady.

    TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT:

        More Cities, More Resources.     Today, the President will expand the YCGII
         to 10 more cities. The Treasury Department will commit $11 million to
         augment its tracing efforts next year, and the Department of Justice will
         dedicate funds from the Bureau of Justice Assistance to help provide
         training to participating state and local law enforcement agencies.
         Additional funds will also be sought for ATF agents from unobligated funds.
