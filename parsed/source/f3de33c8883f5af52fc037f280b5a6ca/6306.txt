     Attached is the final version of the decision memo to POTUS on Coverdell.
     According to Phil Caplan, the President's decision was "let's discuss"
     Since the mark-up is tomorrow, I believe we need to get the discussion to
     happen pretty quickly if we want to have any impact on what
     Dem's--particularly Mosley-Braun--do.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

RE:           STRATEGY ON COVERDELL EDUCATION IRA PROPOSAL


The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to mark-up the Coverdell Education IRA proposal
on Tuesday, February 10, 1998. A group of your advisors, including Secretaries Rubin and
Riley, met with Erskine Friday to discuss our legislative strategy. This memorandum lays out
the current situation, several options, and the recommendations of your economic team.

Background:
Senator Coverdell's proposal would expand the existing education IRA in two ways. First, it
would broaden the accounts to allow for distributions to pay for educational expenses,
including tuition, at private elementary and secondary schools. Currently the accounts
are limited to higher education. Second, it would raise the contribution limit from $500 to
$2,000 annually.

Senator Coverdell's proposal is objectionable on policy grounds for two key reasons. It
provides for tax-side subsidy for private schools, and, thereby, diverts scarce resources
from public schools. In this respect, the proposal can be viewed as a back-door voucher.
Secondly, the tax benefits are heavily skewed to people with high incomes, 70 percent of the
benefits flow to the top 20 percent of families.

For these reasons, as you will recall, you sent a strong letter to the Congressional
Leadership on July 29, 1997, that stated your opposition to the Coverdell proposal and
your intention to veto the entire budget bill if it were included (The Republicans had asked
for the letter as a condition of removing the Coverdell provision from the bill).

Last fall the House passed the Coverdell proposal by a vote of 230-198. During House
consideration, Secretary Riley and Secretary Rubin underscored the Administration's
opposition with a joint letter that opposed the provision on both education and tax policy
grounds. This bill died in the Senate as a result of a successful filibuster effort led by
Senator Kennedy. After the Senate vote, Senator Daschle publicly warned that the
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

filibuster might not hold this year and there is a uncertainty among some Democrats of
how strong our veto resolve is on this issue.
Current Situation
The Coverdell proposal remains a top item on the Republican agenda and they are trying
to move it quickly. Chairman Roth and Majority Leader Lott are pursuing a strategy of
garnering support for Coverdell in return for the inclusion of pet proposals (education
only) of the members on the Committee. That strategy appears to be working. For
Senator Graham, a provision providing tax-free treatment for withdrawals from state
pre-paid tuition plans will be added to the Chairman's mark. Apparently for Senator
Moynihan, favorable tax treatment for employer provided educational assistance is
extended both in time and coverage to include graduate education, as we do in our budget.
 Add Senator Breaux, who has supported Coverdell previously, and even with less than
enthusiastic Republican, Senator Chafee, the bill looks like it could come out of Committee
with a strong vote.

Despite attempts by Senator Moseley-Braun, school construction is not currently included,
though discussions are continuing over the weekend. Sen. Moseley-Braun's staff has
indicated that she would probably vote for Coverdell if it included a school construction
proposal worth at least $3 billion or so over five years (the Administration proposal is $5
billion). You will recall that Senator Lott has been a strong opponent of school
construction in the past.

Options
In our meeting, we discussed the following strategy options: 1) stick to our very strong
veto threat. 2) Continue the veto threat, but encourage Democrats to add school
construction and other items for a possible ultimate deal.


Option 1:
Under this strategy option, we would stick very strongly to our veto threat with the full
intention of vetoing any bill that includes the Coverdell proposal, just as we have done to
date. We would not encourage Democrats, to the extent possible, from adding proposals
that we support.

Pros:

       Consistent with the position you took in your letter to the Congressional leadership
        during the Balanced Budget Agreement negotiations.

       Satisfies public school advocates concerned about vouchers.

       Appears sustainable at least in House (though possibly not in the Senate). There
        are apparently 8-12 wavering Senate Democrats. Both the House and Senate
        dynamic could possibly change to the extent something very attractive gets added,
        such as a robust school construction provision.
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

       Can reassess later if dynamics change, or if veto-proof majority begins to emerge.



Cons:

       Minority Leader Daschle and other Democrats have signaled that they may not stick
        with their position last year opposing Coverdell. The bill could come out of
        Finance with an overwhelming vote.

       Lose opportunity for possible progress on school construction.

       Republicans continue to have a popular issue to criticize us on.

Option 2:
Under this strategy, we would stick to our veto threat, but we would encourage Democrats
to add provisions that we support, such as school construction_ Depending on how much
success Democrats have, down the road we would either engage in negotiations to add more
of our proposals or we would stick to our veto threat.

Pros:

       An opportunity to achieve a success on school construction.

       Robs Republicans of an issue, while forcing them to cave in on school construction.

Cons:

       Would be portrayed as a flip-flop, perhaps affecting credibility of future veto
        threats.

       May contribute to "slippery slope" on school vouchers, as public school advocates
        fear.

       Would be strongly criticized by public education supporters, even if it includes a
        substantial school construction investment.

Recommendation:
All of your advisors agree that Coverdell is bad public policy. Proponents of Coverdell
intend for this to be a first step towards vouchers. Moreover, the tax benefits
disproportionately benefit high income people.

Some of your advisors believe that switching will be seen as moving away from a principled
position. Others, however, point out the potential for an education bill moving through
including pre-paid tuition plan provisions, enhanced employer provided education benefits,
and perhaps school construction. It would be difficult to make an effective public case
against such a bill. An IRA does not strike people as a voucher, plus people understand
lRAs and they like them. The public case against a bill becomes that much harder to the
extent provisions are included that help public schools, such as school construction.

While some of your advisors believe that we will need to continue to re-assess our position
as events unfold, and some felt we should never move off our current position, it is the
consensus view of your advisors that there is nothing to be gained from moving off of your
strong veto threat now. It is also agreed that, we should not, at least for now, encourage
Democrats to try to load up the bill with attractive items, while recognizing that Finance
Committee Democrats will do some of this on their own. Rather, we can encourage
Democrats to offer a proposal as a substitute for CoverdeU when the bill goes to the Senate
floor.
