  TEXT:
    Here are our major projects.  We have not included the following
  specific issues because they seemed speculative or at this point too
  small:  single food agency;  native american executive order; sex
  orientation exec. order; war on heart attacks; virtual university; and DOJ
  debt collection legislation.

  Also there are a couple of other processes that might make sense but we
  didn't include: 1.   21st Consumer. Work towards creating a consumer
  financial bill of rights; and 2. Values group-- investigating ways to
  promote family and responsibility-- including issues of father's
  responsibilities, and alternatives/additions to the marriage penalty
  option to encourage marriage.
