Lyn and I would like your reaction to the attached proposal. As you will
see, it involves a series of Presidential actions which will help welfare
recipients obtain jobs by linking them to job listings via the internet.
It will also involve praising private sector efforts in this area.

Re:    Welfare Reform and the Internet Project


The following is a proposal to give welfare offices around the country access to the World Wide
Web and the Internet in order to access valuable information on employment, child care
resources, available social support services, and other information relevant to both welfare
recipients and caseworkers.

Proposal

We propose to expand Internet access to high traffic welfare offices around the country.
Providing Internet access to key welfare offices will accomplish several goals: 1) welfare
recipients and caseworkers will have access to Internet job banks, including the Department of
Labor's America's Job Bank; 2) welfare recipients and caseworkers will have access to other
relevant information including training programs, job placement organizations, and child care
resources; 3) welfare intake offices would be able to link to the DOL one-stop shops; 4) welfare
recipients could market themselves on the Internet by posting resumes, and; 5) welfare offices
around the country could share information on best practices.

Background

There are approximately 6,500 welfare field offices in the country. About one third of those
offices are already connected to the Internet or have adequate computer hardware to easily link to
the Internet. To ensure that every welfare office has at least two computers connected to the
Internet, we would have to provide hardware and software at a cost of approximately
$40,365,000 initially plus additional annual operating costs of $14,235,000.

Through computer donations and executive orders we can defray most of the start-up costs.
Further, by targeting high traffic welfare offices or those in high poverty areas, we can better
target our scarce resources. However, even if computers are donated, operating costs will still
be incurred.

1     Help Welfare Offices Connect to the Internet to Access Electronic Job Listings and Other
      Work-Related Information

     Expand Executive Order 12999 to cover welfare offices. EO 12999 streamlines the
      transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment to the Nation's classrooms.
      By expanding this executive order to cover welfare offices in addition to classrooms, we
      can access available computers for some of the 6,500 welfare offices.

     Announce private sector commitments to donate computers and provide training,
      technical, and maintenance services. (These donations would hopefully come from a
      wide variety of sources including companies involved with Work Now, high tech firms
      that are members of the Association of ChiefInformation Officers, and a consortium
      formed by Software Technology Corporation of Georgia.)

     Direct Federal agencies to encourage their computer suppliers to donate used computers
      following contract refresh periods. (Refresh contracts with suppliers require those
      suppliers to update or "refresh" the government's computers on a regular basis.)

     Announce annual Presidential awards to companies that donate computers to this and
      other government efforts, and honor each company on the White House web page.

     Direct HHS and the Department of Labor to notify state welfare agencies how they could
      obtain donated computers and access job data banks. The agencies would also track
      how many donations were made.

11    Expand Job Listings on the Internet and Increase Access to More Web Sites

     Issue an Executive Order directing federal agencies and government contractors to
      electronically file all job listings with America's Job Bank, increasing the number of job
      listings on the internet.

     Direct the Department of Labor to link America's Job Bank to OPM and any other private
      sector job banks that wish to be linked. America's Job Bank, a nationwide Internet job
      bank, lists approximately 750,000 openings, 95 percent of which are private sector, from
      state organized job banks and national entries. The OPM directory lists all available
      federal jobs. Software Technology Corporation in Georgia is running HeadHunter.NET,
      a fully automated job search and posting service that provides free access to all job
      listings and allows recruiters, companies and businesses to post their listings at no charge.

     Direct White House staff to expand the White House welfare reform web site to provide
      links to America's Job Bank and other related web sites.

Next Steps

Before announcing these actions, we would want to ensure that:

      Adequate private sector commitments can be announced.

      State representatives (i.e., APWA and NGA) will welcome the plan.

      Adding welfare offices to EO 12999 won't interfere with the Administration's computers
       in the classroom goals.

      Department of Labor is ready to execute new actions (i.e. link to other databanks).

      Plans are discussed with Software Technology Corporation and Speaker Gingrich.

      We have decided whether to target this initiative only to certain welfare offices and which
       criteria, if any, should be used.
