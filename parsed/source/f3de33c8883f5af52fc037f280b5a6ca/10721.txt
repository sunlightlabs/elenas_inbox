01/12/99 DRAFT



                 SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE
                   CHILD LABOR REFORM ACT OF 1999


SECTION 1.   SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE.

     Section 1 provides the short title and provides that, whenever

the Act references a section or other provision, the reference is

to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)



SECTION 2.   AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT.

Current Law: Under the current statute and the Department's

regulations, children of any age may work at any time in any occupation

on farms owned or operated by their parents or legal guardians

("family farm" exemption).    In addition, children aged 12 and older

may work on a farm where their parent works ("parental co-employee")

or with a parent's written consent ("parental consent")            in any

non-hazardous occupation outside of school hours; and children as

young as 10 may work outside of school hours with parental consent

in short season crop cultivation under very narrow waiver conditions

established by the Secretary of Labor ("short season work" sometimes

called "tiny tots" exemption).    Hazardous occupations restrictions

in agriculture apply to children under age 16, who may not work in

any agricultural occupation which the Secretary has, by regulation,

declared particularly hazardo·us.

child labor prohibitions for agricultural employment      (parental

co-employee; parental consent; short season work); applies the same

age restrictions to agricultural employment as to other forms of

employment; and preserves the "family farm" exemption exactly as

it operates under current law.      This section raises from 16 to 18

years old the minimum age for engaging in hazardous agricultural

employment, but also authorizes the Secretary to exempt from the

hazardous occupations restrictions children aged 16 and 17 who either

are employed as vocational agriculture student-learners, have

successfully completed a Federal Extension Service training program,

or have    succ~ssfully   completed a vocational agriculture training

program.



SECTION 3.    PEDDLING BY CHILDREN.

Current Law: There is no current statutory or regulatory prohibi tion

on peddling by children.      Activities of such peddlers are subject

to the current statutory prohibition on employment of minors under

age 14 in any non-agricultural employment      (except if employed by

parent or legal guardian), and to current regulations setting limits

on hours during which younger teenagers may work (14- and

15-year-olds) .




                                    2

term "oppressive child labor"     to include "peddling by children",

and prohibits the employment of individuals under age 16 in

"peddling".      However, section 3 excludes from the definition of

peddling by children volunteer selling of goods or services on behalf

of not-for-profit organizations.        Except for such volunteer

activities, this section makes peddling by children under age 16

subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act.



SECTION 4 ·    CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR CHILD LABOR VIOLATIONS.

Current Law: The maximum civil money penalty is $10,000 per child,

per violation.      In criminal prosecution, a person convicted of a

willful violation of child labor rules is subject to a fine of not

more than $10,000, or to imprisonment for not more than six months,

or both.      However, imprisonment is available only upon the person's

second conviction for a willful child labor violation.



Description of Provision: Section 4 increases civil and criminal

penalties for child labor violations.       The maximum civil money

penalty would be $15,000, and this maximum penalty could be increased

by a factor of five for: (1) a willful or repeat violation that results

in or contributes to a fatality or      permanent disability of a minor

employee, or (2) a violation that is concurrent with a serious or

willful violation of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.


                                    3
                                                            i i.:x-Durnp Conv';,SiOil


Additional criminal penalties would be available in certain types

of serious cases: $15,000 maximum fine, or imprisonment for up to

5 years (without a previous conviction), or both, for a willful or

repeat violation that results in or contributes to a fatality or

permanent disability of a minor employee, or a violation which is

concurrent with a criminal violation of any other FLSA provision

or any other Federal or State law.     In addition, Section 4 'defines

"repeated violations"   and "willful violations"; these definitions

would apply to civil and criminal money penal ties, and to the statute

of limitations, under the FLSA.



SECTION 5.   GOODS TAINTED BY OPPRESSIVE CHILD LABOR.

Current Law: Current law prohibits shipment or delivery for shipment

in interstate commerce of any goods produced in an establishment

where illegal child labor occurred in the thirty days prior to the

removal of the goods.   Where such goods are removed, they are "hot"

and their movement may be enjoined.     Current law does not identify

any means by which child labor "hot" goods may be returned to commerce;

the Department deals with this issue on a case-by-case basis.



Description of Provision: Section 5 authorizes the Secretary to

determine the circumstances under which goods tainted by oppressive

child labor may be allowed to be shipped or delivered for shipment

in interstate commerce.


                                   4
                                                                  Autom~icd ;',::C0[r': ::l:n?t>;"r: Lii Cystem
                                                                            f!CkOuIilP Conv..J,sioil


     SECTION 6.        COORDINATION.

     Current Law: Under current law, the Secretary may, with the consent

     and cooperation of State agencies,              "utilize the services of State

     and local agencies and their employees" for carrying out the

     Secretary I   S   functions and duties.       The Secretary may reimburse these

     agencies for services rendered.               The Department interprets this

     provision to authorize the use of State officials in investigations

     and other similar activities, under memoranda of understanding.



     Description of Provision: Section 6 directs the Secretary to

     establish closer working relationships with non-governmental

     organizations and with State and local government agencies having

     responsibility and authority for administering and enforcing labor

     and safety and health laws; requires. State and local government

     agencies to submit information to the Department on the Department 's

     request (to the extent permissible under applicable law) regarding

     injuries and deaths of employees; and authorizes the Secretary to

     reimburse such agencies for such services.



     SECTION 7.        REGULATIONS AND MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING.

     Current Law: There is currently no requirement for a memorandum of

     understanding between the Secretaries of Labor and Agriculture to

     coordinate the development and enforcement of standards to eliminate

                                               5

to promulgate regulations for various purposes in child labor.



Description of Provision: Section 7 authorizes the Secretary to issue

"such regulations as are necessary to carry out this Act and the

amendments made by this Act."   The provision also directs the

Secretaries of Labor and Agriculture to enter into a memorandum of

understanding to coordinate the development and enforcement of

standards to eliminate oppressive child labor.



SECTION 8.   AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

     Section 8 authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act and

the amendments made by this Act.
