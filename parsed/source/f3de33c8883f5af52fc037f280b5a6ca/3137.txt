Franklin D. Raines, Director, and John Koskinen, Deputy Director for

Appropriations and Governmental Affairs Committees regarding the implementation
of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).

RECONCILIATION:
Late tonight, the House Rules Committee reported the rule for consideration of
the spending and the tax reconciliation bills.  The rule waives all points of
order, and provides for three hours of debate on each bill .. We transmitted our
letter from the OMB Director to the Committee this afternoon, outlining our
concerns with the spending bill.  In addition, we plan to send a letter to the
House floor on Wednesday morning regarding changes the Rules Committee made in
the spending bill.



The Senate aims to complete action on the spending bill on Wednesday, and begin
consideration of the tax bill late Wednesday or early Thursday (likely).
Treasury anticipates sending letters to the House and Senate on Wednesday
afternoon, addressing Administration concerns with the tax bills.

health services.
o Passed (62-38) Roth motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the Durbin
point of order against a prov~sion that would gradually raise Medicare
eligibility age from 65 to 67 between 2003 & 2027.
