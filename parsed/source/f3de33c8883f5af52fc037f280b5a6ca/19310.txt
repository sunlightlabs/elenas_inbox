                 DECLINING MINORITY ADMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA

Background: According to figures released by the University of California, minority admissions to
            most University of California institutions have dropped dramatically this year absent
            affirmative action. For example, at the Berkeley campus, minority admissions have
            decreased 57% for black students, 40% for Hispanic students, and 39% for American
            Indian students from last year's rates. At UCLA, minority admissions have
            decreased 43% for black students, 33% for Hispanic students, and 43% for American
            Indian students.

Question:     How do you respond to today's reports that minority admissions to California's
              universities have dropped dramatically?

Answer:       The Administration is extremely concerned about the decline in the numbers of
              African-American, Hispanic, and Native American students admitted to universities
              in California as a result of Proposition 209 and the University of California Board of
              Regents' decision to prohibit the use of properly constructed affirmative action in
              admissions. Educational opportunity is the touchstone of the American dream and
              the key to America's continued strength in the 21st century. At a time when our
              nation is becoming more and more diverse, we must not close the doors of
              educational opportunity to our students of color. Furthermore, we must recognize
              that diversity on campus is a vital educational resource that strengthens the
              educational experience for all our students. For these reasons, every American
              should be concerned about the developments in California.

Question:     How do you respond to those who say that the drops in minority admissions only
              indicate the extent to which race was being used to admit underqualified minority
              students?

Answer:       I strongly disagree with that analysis. According to today's Washington Post, the
              University of California at Berkeley had to reject more than 800 minority applicants
              who had perfect 4.0 high school grade point averages and SAT scores of 1200 or
              higher. These minority students are exceptionally qualified for any college or
              university in the country. Furthermore, we as a nation must realize that diversity and
              excellence go hand in hand; they are fully compatible and indeed complementary
              goals. Any educator will tell you that students learn from each other as well in their
              classes and from their professors-- that's why diversity is important.

Question:     What is your administration doing to address this problem?

Answer:       Weare working on several fronts to address this issue:

             We will continue to strongly support properly constructed affirmative action
              programs in higher education. For example, we will continue to intervene in
              litigation in support of appropriate affirmative action programs and to challenge the
              Hopwood decision.

   The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education will continue to
    investigate complaints concerning current admissions policies, including those at
    three University of California law schools, to determine whether they violate federal
    civil rights laws by discriminating against minority students.

   We will continue to press higher education officials to maintain and expand diversity,
    and we will offer assistance to them to do so. For example, we have called on
    colleges and universities burdened by new legal restrictions to develop new and
    creative approaches to achieving diversity, such as aggressively recruiting in
    secondary schools with high percentages of minority students and forming
    educational partnerships with such schools.

   Finally, the President has recently announced a dramatic array of education policy
    actions that will improve educational opportunity and outcomes for all Americans
    and thereby strengthen the pipeline of students progressing from K -12 education to
    college. These initiatives include:

           High Hopes --a $140 million investment in the FY 1999 budget -- that
           promotes partnerships between colleges and middle/junior high schools in
           low-income communities. These partnerships will provide students with
           vital support services -- including tutoring, counseling, and mentoring and
           with information on college options, academic requirements, costs, and
           financial aid to help students stay on track through high school graduation and
           college.

           Education Opportunity Zones -- 50 high poverty urban and rural school
           districts will be provided with funds to enable them to accelerate their
           progress and provide models of system-wide improvement in student
           achievement, including the use of high academic standards, quality teaching
           and school and student accountability.

           Small Class with Qualified Teachers -- In order to improve reading in
           grades 1-3, the Administration is proposing a $12.4 billion initiative over 7
           years to help local schools hire 100,000 teachers to provide students with
           small classes and well-prepared teachers in the early grades.

           Teacher Preparation and Recruitment - Title V -- President Clinton has
           proposed a $350 million initiative to attract nearly 35,000 outstanding new
           teachers into high-poverty schools in urban and rural areas over the next five
           years. In addition, it will upgrade the quality of teacher preparation at
           institutions of higher education that work in partnership with local schools in
           inner city and poor rural areas.

           Hispanic Education Action Plan -- The Administration's FY99 budget
           provides substantial education investments in programs that are targeted to the

needs of Hispanic students, including increases in Bilingual Education,
funding for Hispanic Serving Institutions, TRIO college preparation programs
and migrant education programs.
