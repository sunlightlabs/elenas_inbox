RE:           TOBACCO SMUGGLING

DATE:         AUGUST 25, 1997

SUMMARY

        Cigarette smuggling to other countries has almost tripled in the last few years up to 280
billion cigarettes a year. Smuggling increases have correlated to increases in duties and taxes
imposed on foreign cigarettes. Tobacco companies have a role in cigarette smuggling in that
they sell to traders and dealers who, in turn, funnel the cigarettes to smugglers. There are
criminal cases currently pending in Spain, China, Canada, and the United States. Two Brown &
Williamson sales managers have recently pleaded guilty to federal charges of aiding smugglers.

       The recent upsurge in smuggling could have impacts on the proposed settlement with the
tobacco companies, specifically with respect to the FDA regulation of nicotine in that the
settlement, as written, requires the FDA to prove that a change in the level of nicotine or other
harmful components "will not result in the creation of a significant demand for contraband."
Because the levels of contraband in other countries is already so high, by requiring the FDA to
prove a negative, the settlement sets up an extremely high standard. In addition, given the
experience of other countries that have raised cigarette prices, the proposed settlement might
open the door to increased smuggling in the United States.

      Other than its involvement in the specific cases mentioned in this memo in Syracuse and
New Orleans, DO] reports that it does not have a nationwide, coordinated effort or task force to
combat smuggling.

FACTS ON SMUGGLING

      The volume of cigarette smuggling around the world has nearly tripled.

      Researchers estimate that one-fourth of the cigarettes sold overseas pass through
       smuggling rings set up to evade foreign taxes.

      Criminal investigations in several countries show that people in the tobacco industry have
       played a major role in stimulating and facilitating the smuggling of cigarettes. The most


                                                I
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

     common way in which cigarette companies playa role is that each year they sell billions .
     of dollars of cigarettes to traders and dealers who, in tum, funnel the cigarettes to
     smugglers.

RECENT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS

1.   Canada

    Newly released court documents in Syracuse show that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
     the second-largest American cigarette maker, sponsored trips to a lUxury Canadian fishing
     resort for several dealers who have subsequently been charged with conspiring to
     smuggle cigarettes to Canada. On one fishing trip in 1995, one Reynolds salesman, Les
     Thompson, even joked to the dealers about the smuggling, implicitly acknowledging that
     he had knowledge of it.

    One informant said it was clear that Mr. Thompson from Reynolds knew that the dealers
     were selling to cigarettes to American Indians who smuggled them across the St.
     Lawrence River.

    The investigation involving R.J. Reynolds is centered in Syracuse and Canada. In June,
     a grand jury in Syracuse indicted 21 people on charges that they were involved in
     smuggling $700 million worth of cigarettes and alcohol through the St. Regis Indian
     Reservation in upstate New York from 1992 through 1996.

    In another investigation in New Orleans, two Brown & Williamson sales managers have
     recently pleaded guilty to charges of aiding smugglers in bringing cigarettes illegally into
     Canada.


2.   Spain

    One of Europe's biggest cigarette traders, Michael Hanggi, admits that he had been
     buying Winstons from R.J. Reynolds for 15 years and had resold many of them in Spain.

    Mr. Hanggi said that his three-person trading company in Switzerland had handled $100
     million in sales last year.

    Authorities estimate that last year that 2.3 billion Winstons made by RJ. Reynolds, or
     $200 million worth, were smuggled into Spain.

    Investigators found a series of faxes showing that for years Reynolds officials in Geneva
     kept track of the volume of cigarettes that were supposedly being shipped to Senegal in
     West Africa but instead were illegally diverted to Spain. Given that all the shipments


                                              2
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

     were diverted to Spain, the figures could not possibly have matched Reynold's sales
     reports from Senegal. In fact, USDA figures show that Senegal imports no more than
     500 million cigarettes a year --less than one-fourth of the amount diverted to Spain.

3.   Italy

    Two organized crime groups in Italy take in $500 million per year by smuggling
     Malboros they buy from Swiss dealers selling products made by the Philip Morris
     Companies, the largest cigarette maker in America.

4.   China and Hong Kong

    Later this year, Hong Kong prosecutors plan to place a former marketing manager for the
     British-American Tobacco Corporation, a subsidiary ofB.A.T. Industries and a British
     affiliate of Brown & Williamson, on trial on charges that he accepted more than $3
     million in bribes from dealers involved in smuggling cigarettes into China.

    Smuggling accounts for 4 to 5 percent of the cigarettes sold in China. But the market is
     so vast that this amounts to 70 billion to 85 billion cigarettes a year.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q:   What is the scope of the smuggling?

    Market Tracking International Ltd., a research firm in London that provides data to
     tobacco industry publications, estimates that 280 billion of the 1 trillion cigarettes
     exported each year by all producing nations pass through the hands of smugglers, up from
     100 billion in 1989.

    In Spain, Winston, manufactured by R.J. Reynolds, is the most popular foreign brand, and
     last year 60 percent of its sales were contraband. The smugglers can sell a pack of
     contraband Winstons for $1.30 to $1.60, about the same price as a local brand and
     one-third less than the price oflegal Winstons.

Q:   What are the causes of the recent surge in smuggling?

    There are many causes from the relaxation of customs inspections in Europe to the
     opening of markets in Russia and Eastern Europe. The surge is also attributable to the
     expansion of sales overseas by American tobacco companies, High taxes, limits on
     imports, and corrupt distribution systems also help account for the increase in cigarette
     smuggling.

Q:   What have the cigarette companies said?             Hex-Dump Conversion

    Spokespersons for the three cigarette companies, R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, and
     Brown & Williamson, publicly maintain that they did not knowingly sell to dealers who
     supplied to smugglers. The companies urge that their executives did not do anything
     wrong and that they should not be held accountable for illegal activity that occurred after
     they sold their product. However, some of the evidence in criminal cases in Spain,
     Canada, and China indicates that the companies did have some knowledge. For instance,
     R.J. Reynolds kept track of the shipments of cigarettes allegedly destined for Senegal but
     that were instead diverted to Spain.

Q:   How much does the smuggling cost?

    The smuggling costs foreign governments an estimated $16 billion a year in lost
     revenues. But more important, health experts say it threatens to undermine initiatives in
     many nations to discourage smoking, particularly among teenagers.

Q:   What is the potential impact for the settlement?

    FDA authority to regulate nicotine. The proposed agreement says that before the FDA
     could order the companies to lower the nicotine in cigarettes, it would have to guarantee
     that smugglers would not bring in more potent substitutes. But given how easily
     smuggling can take place, the President said last month that this provision was
     unreasonable and should be changed. Specifically, the settlement provides that the FDA
     shall be permitted to require the gradual reduction of nicotine and the possible
     elimination of other harmful components of tobacco products, provided it can
     demonstrate that the changes: (1) will result in a significant reduction of the health risks
     associated with such products; (2) are technologically feasible; and (3) will not result in
     the creation of a significant demand for contraband or other tobacco products.

    Raising prices could lead to smuggling in U.S. There is a potential that raising prices
     in the U.S. could cause an increase of smuggling in American brands manufactured
     elsewhere.

    Increased smuggling worldwide. With the restrictions imposed on the tobacco
     companies in the proposed settlement, the tobacco companies are expected to step up
     their efforts to expand their markets in other countries. With sales expected to decrease
     in the U.S. as the result of the settlement, there could be an even greater increase in
     smuggling worldwide.

    Tobacco companies' attitudes and cooperation with investigators. Tobacco
                               companies have demonstrated that they are not willing to


                                              4
stated that tobacco company officials hide behind Swiss
law which basically does not view smuggling as a crime
and contains provisions on secrecy in commercial
transactions.
