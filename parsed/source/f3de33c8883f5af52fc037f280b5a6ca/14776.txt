          TEXT:
          This is more problematic than I would have predicted. We would need to
          call in OMB and NEC for advice before we could agree to this. Also, I'm
          not familiar with the line we have drawn on affirmative action quotas; the
          draft calls for a set percentage of the federal work force to be people
          with disabilities, so we would have to measure this against our policies
          there.

          Here is a briefing paper on it:

           Comments on Draft Executive Order on Employment of People with Disabilities

           Would establish a goal of parity in the employment rate between people with and without
            people with disabilities by the year 2006, including an interim goal of "a 3 percent annual
            increase in the employment rate" of people with disabilities.

            It is not clear whether parity is an achievable goal. And the annual improvement
            expected appears quite ambitious. We should discuss with the NEC.

           Calls on federal agencies to "eliminate employment barriers to persons with disabilities,
            such as discrimination and inadequate access to health care.... "

            It is not clear that federal agencies are in a position to accomplish this without vastly
            increased resources.

           Sets a target that II % of the federal workforce shall be persons with disabilities.

            This must be considered in light of existing policies on targets for federal hiring.

           Would extend the Department of Defense's ComputerlElectronics Accommodations
            Program ("CAP") to the civilian agencies, with funding for the expansion to be "sought
            within" DOD budget.

            CAP is an excellent program that provides Defense employees with disabilities with the
            latest in computer equipment to allow them to do their jobs. The program has a
            showroom for equipment and serves as a central purchasing point so that federal
            purchasing power is maximized. Since funding for the program is centralized, individual
            departments do not have to bear the costs of a very expensive piece of computer
            equipment for an employee. Last year, the DPC recommended to OMB that we expand
            CAP to all federal agencies, but the change was not funded in the budget.

           In an otherwise innocuous section on encouraging small business and micro-enterprise
            among people with disabilities, the draft refers to using "the full buying power of the
            Federal government" to put people to work.

            We would have to consider this in the context of current policy on federal purchases.

           Gives a one-year deadline for Labor and Commerce to develop a monthly measurement
            of the unemployment rate of people with disabilities.

            We would have to investigate how achievable this suggestion is, and budget implications.

     Suggested Talking Point: Thank you for all the hard work you have put into this package. As
     you can imagine, the specific points in the draft raise a number of budget and economic issues
     that we will want to discuss with you. We assume we should work with the President's
     Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities as we pursue these issues further.
