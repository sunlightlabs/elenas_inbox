                                     A Step Backwards
                                           May 18, 1998



 "While we truly appreciate your efforts to revise the spending reductions in this new draft,
 the total amount of mandatory and discretionary cuts are still of such a magnitude that they
 are neither desirable [nor] attainable. "
            --Reps. Michael Castle (R-DE), Fred Upton (R-MI), and Nancy Johnson (R-CT)
                in a 5/13/98 letter to Republican budget plan author and Budget
 Committee              Chairman John Kasich


President Clinton Has Restored Fiscal Discipline to Washington. In 1993, President Clinton
inherited a budget deficit of $290 billion; thanks to the landmark budget packages of 1993 and
1997, this year President Clinton will deliver a budget in surplus for the first time since 1969.
That fiscal progress has helped spur an investment-led expansion, creating more than 15 million
new jobs and bringing unemployment to its lowest level in a generation. The President's 1999
budget builds on that legacy by facing up to our next fiscal challenge -- the retirement of the baby
boom generation -- and by preparing us for the new century.             President Clinton's budget
reserves the entire surplus until Social Security is strengthened, provides targeted tax cuts -- that
are fully paid for in his balanced budget -- to help families afford child care, to spur school
construction and expand pension coverage, and makes major investments in education and health
research.

The House Republican Budget is a Return to the Irresponsible Budgets of the 1980s. The
latest House GOP budget is as deeply flawed as the budgets of 1980's that were built on rosy
scenarios and unrealistic savings. It assumes billions of dollars in savings, but doesn't explain
what initiatives will be hit. It is time for the Republican leadership to tell the American people
where they'll cut and how much. Will Medicare be first or Head Start? Student loans or tax
cuts for the working poor? Cancer research or environmental clean-up? When the details are
on the table, we believe the American people, and Members of both parties in Congress will
roundly reject this budget, because it does not square with their values.

The House Republican Budget Takes Us in the Wrong Direction. While the President's
budget moves the country forward, the new House Republican budget represents a step
backwards to the divisive budgets of 1995. That budget no longer spells out the details of the
dramatic cuts it relies on, but the initial GOP proposal made its targets perfectly clear. We are
hopeful that even most Republicans will choose not to support a budget that could end up cutting
education and Medicaid, raising taxes on working Americans, and sending 50,000 young people
doing service in their communities home for the year.


The House Republican Budget Breaks Last Year's Promises. Exactly one year ago
Democrats and Republicans reached the historic Balanced Budget Agreement. Both parties made
                                                                    Hex-Dwnp Conversion

concessions to reach a deal setting a schedule to bring the budget to balance, with Democrats
extracting' guarantees that many key domestic programs be protected. Just one year later the
House Republican Budget would break these promises, including a pledge to protect funding for
the earned income tax credit which helps the working poor, for food stamps, for the Head Start
program, for bilingual education, and for the clean-up of Superfund sites.

The House Republican Budget Could Lead to Across-the-Board Cuts. This House
Republican Budget is the second version issued, after the first budget plan was quickly
withdrawn due to harsh objections over its intention to abolish key domestic programs. In
the second version, House Republicans deliberately have chosen to avoid revealing the
details that show which programs they will undermine or eliminate in order to pay for
their budget. However, there's no escaping that this plan requires them to violate the
bipartisan spending cap agreement and threatens virtually all key domestic investments. If
the House Republican budget were ever agreed to and the Appropriations Committee
implemented it across the board, it would:
              Undermine food safety by eliminating an estimated more than 1000 meatand
               poultry inspectors. This budget would also create major delays in the drive to
               modernize the federal inspection system, including upgraded lab testing for
               harmful pathogens in the food supply.
              Threaten public health by reducing funding for the Centers for Disease
               Control by more than $800 million in five years, cutting childhood
               immunization funding and breast and cervical cancer screening.
              Deny training initiatives for 1.3 million dislocated workers over 5 years.
              Hamper efforts to protect the environment, by slashing funds for initiatives
               to combat climate change, designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cut
               energy usage, and save consumers' money. Jeopardizes the safety of
               drinking water and food supply by cutting funds meant to clean up factory
               farm pollution.
              Delay environmental cleanup, by freezing funding for the clean up of
               Superfund sites, seriously delaying the completion of work and jeopardizing
               the public health of those living nearby.

The House Budget Fails to Fund the Highway Bill. The House highway bill, which includes
billions of dollars in excessive levels of funding, is ignored in this budget so it ends up not
accounting for what's actually happening in Congress. When it's actually accounted for, the
high cost of the House highway bill could put even more pressure on critical priorities, such as
education, law enforcement, and the environment.
                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dwnp Conversion

                                               May 15, 1998                                              I
    The earlier House Republican budget, also authored by Chairman Kasich, has threatened to
    reopen the old wounds that were part of the battle leading to the government shutdown in 1995.
    Again, the Republicans said they wanted to terminate or significantly reduce funds to run the
    Americorps volunteer program, for community banking and economic development, for legal
    services to the poor, and for bloc grants to public schools which fund safety and anti-drug
    programs. These cuts were unacceptable in 1995, as the government shutdown showed, and
    they are unacceptable today. For now, Republicans have pulled back this budget with its
    detailed cuts, but they haven't explained where they'll find the money instead.

    A list of the specific cuts the Republicans outlined is instructive. It shows how far the
    Republicans would go, in order to pay for the budget they want.

          Cutting Health Care Coverage for Poor Americans. The House Republican budget
           relies on major entitlement savings that are now unspecified. But the first draft of the
           GOP budget actually eliminated a major portion of the federal Medicaid guarantee for
           those savings. Eliminating the guarantee of acute care is a major step backwards -- an
           old idea that was resoundingly rejected in 1995. Our bipartisan goal should be to expand
           health coverage and make it more secure, not to reduce insurance coverage.

          Backtracking on Welfare Reform. The first House GOP budget backed away from a
           fundamental bipartisan tenet of~elfare reform: encouraging work. The budget would
           undermine our efforts to encourage and reward work:

                  Raises taxes on 3.5 million low income working Americans -- President
                   Clinton believes that Americans who work hard, pay payroll taxes, and play by
                   the rules should not have to live in poverty. The first House GOP budget
                   eliminated the Earned Income Tax Credit for single adults over 24 years old with
                   no children earning less than $10,000, hitting them with an average tax increase of
                   $192. These are people who work hard and pay payroll taxes, and the President
                   believes that they should not be taxed into poverty.

                  Weakens Welfare-to-Work. The Republican budget eliminated $1.5 billion of
                   Welfare-to-Work grants that were part of the Balanced Budget Agreement. Last
                   year, we reached bipartisan agreement to provide resources to communities to
                   help. provide job opportunities for the hardest-to-employ welfare recipients.
                   Zeroing out next year's funding would result in eliminating job training and
                   job finding assistance intended to lead to self sufficiency for some 300,000
                   welfare recipients.

          Punishes Those Trying to Move Off Welfare. Undoes the Balanced Budget
           Agreement by cutting food stamps for those willing to work but unable, through no
           fault of their own, to find employment. This cut could also represent a cost shift to

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


        States and localities, who would be left with the burden of providing emergency food.
        assistance for these people.

       Cuts or Eliminates Important Investments in Education. The first House GOP
        budget cut education, training, and social service programs by billions of dollars. Some
        of the targets include:
               Denies aid to one million college students who want to work for their
                education. This GOP budget eliminates the Work-Study and other
                campus-based aid programs.
               Cuts off the promised investment in technology literacy. This five-year, $2
                billion investment is now in its third year. The GOP budget would end this
                effort.
               Eliminates help for children who need to learn English, by eliminating the
                primary program for innovative local efforts for training teachers and aiding
                children who are not proficient in English. This budget would deny that
                opportunity to 1.4 million students, and would prevent more than 4,000 teachers
                from being trained.
               Pulls the rug out from state and local School-to-Work efforts. The GOP
                budget eliminates the School-to-Work program before it has finished its job
                helping States and localities improve education through strong partnerships with
                business.
               Turns Title I into a voucher program. Since the reforms Congress enacted in
                 1994, Title I has begun to tum around low-achieving schools and raise academic
                standards in high poverty communities. Turning Title I into a voucher program
                will reverse efforts already underway to improve public education in these
                communities.

       Discourages Service. The House Republican budget undermines our effort to encourage
         community service, by eliminating the successful Americorps program. Some 50,000
        Americans would not have not have the opportunity to provide service to their
        communities and earn funds for college. These participants would have leveraged
        hundreds ofthousands of volunteer tutors for the America Reads program.

       Dismantles the Commerce and Energy Departments -- The first House budget plan
        proposed eliminating the Departments of Commerce and Energy. These cuts would
        undermine our weather prediction capability, reduce civilian hi-tech research, and
        eliminate economic assistance to needy communities.

        Reduces the credit and investment capital available in distressed communities. The
        first GOP House budget eliminates the Community Development Financial
        Institutions Fund (CDFI). The Fund supports a network of CDFIs, including
        community development banks, credit unions and venture capital funds, which
        promote entrepreneurship and help restore neighborhoods.
