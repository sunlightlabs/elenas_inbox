                 CLINTON-GORE ACCOMPLISHMENT~
                      REFORMING WELFARE

    On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and
    Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, fulfilling his longtime commitment to 'end
    welfare as we know it. ' As the President said upon signing, ..... this legislation
    provides an historic opportunity to end welfare as we know it and transform our
    broken welfare system by promoting the fundamental values of work,
    responsibility, and family . ..

              TRANSFORMING THE BROKEN WELFARE SYSTEM

   Overhauling the Welfare System with the Personal Responsibility Act: Last year the
    President signed a bipartisan welfare plan that is dramatically changing the nation's
    welfare system into one that requires work in exchange for time-limited assistance. The
    law contains strong work requirements, a performance bonus to reward states for moving
    welfare recipients into jobs, state maintenance of effort requirements, comprehensive
    child support enforcement, and supports for families moving from welfare to work --
    including increased funding for child care and guaranteed medical coverage. State
    strategies are making a real difference in the success of welfare reform, specifically in
    job placement, child care, transportation, and child support (see attached for state
    examples). [Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996,
    P.L. 104-193, signed 8/22/96]

   Law Builds on the Administration's Welfare Reform Strategy: Even before the
    Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act became law, many states were well
    on their way to changing their welfare programs to jobs programs. By granting Federal
    waivers, the Clinton Administration allowed 43 states -- more than all previous
    Administrations combined -- to require work, time-limit assistance, make work pay,
    improve child support enforcement, and encourage parental responsibility. Nearly 90
    percent of states have chosen to continue or build on their welfare demonstration projects
    approved by the Clinton Administration. [HHS Fact Sheet, 7/3/97]

    Largest Decline in the Welfare Rolls in History: From January 1993 to May 1997,
    the number of people receiving welfare benefits fell by 24 percent, or 3.4 million
    recipients - the largest decline in the welfare rolls in history and the lowest percentage of
    the population on welfare since 1970. This historic decline occurred in response to the
    Administration's grants of Federal waivers to 43 states, the welfare reform law taking
    effect, and the strong economy. [HHS, 4/97]

   Mobilizing the Business Community: To make welfare reform a success and help move
    a million people form welfare into the workforce by the year 2000, President Clinton has
    enlisted the business community's leadership. At the President's urging, the Welfare to
    Work Partnership was launched in May 1997 to lead the national business effort to hire
                                                                  H                       ement System
                                                                    ex-Dump Conversion

    people from the welfare rolls. Founded with 100 participating businesses, the
    Partnership pledged to reach 1000 business within six months. This is a city by city effort
    working with both small and large businesses. To help companies hire welfare
    recipients, the Welfare to Work Partnership networks businesses with other employers
    who have experience in hiring welfare recipients. In addition, it provides technical
    assistance and support, such as: a 1-800 number, the Partnership's Web site
    (www.welfaretowork.org) and a "Blueprint for Business" manual that contains
    information on finding, recruiting, training, hiring, and retaining former welfare
    recipients .

          . ,. and Civic, Religious and Non-profit Groups: The Vice President created the
    Welfare to Work Coalition to Sustain Success, a coalition of civic groups committed to
    helping former welfare recipients stay in the workforce and succeed. Tailoring their
    services to meet welfare recipients needs and the organizations' strengths, the Coalition
    will focus on providing mentoring and other support services. Charter members of the
    Coalition include: the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Baptist Joint Committee, the
    United Way, the YMCA, and fourteen other civic groups. [DPC Fact paper]

   Doing Our Fair Share with the Federal Government's Hiring Initiative: Under the
    Clinton Administration, the Federal workforce has been reduced by more than 300,000
    positions, the smallest the Federal government has been in thirty years. Yet, this
    Administration also believes that the Federal govermnent, as the nation's largest
    employer, must lead by example. The President asked the Vice President to oversee the
    Federal government's hiring initiative, in which Federal agencies have committed to
    directly hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients in the next four years. As a part of this
    effort, the White House pledged, and has already met this pledge, to hire six welfare
    recipients by 2000.

   Enforcing Child Support - 50% Increase in Collections: The Clinton Administration
    collected a record $12 billion in child support in 1996 through tougher enforcement, an
    increase of $4 billion, or nearly 50 percent, since 1992. Not only are collections up, but
    the number of families that are actually receiving child support has also increased. In
    1996, the number of child support cases with collections rose to 4 million, an increase of
    43 percent, from 2.8 million in 1992. And paternity establishment, often the first crucial
    step in child support cases, has dramatically increased. In 1996, the number of
    paternities established rose to nearly 1 million, almost double, from 516,000 in 1992.

          Making Deadbeat Parents Pay: The President's unprecedented and sustained
    campaign to make deadbeat parents pay is working. In addition to tougher enforcement
    including a strong partnership with states, President Clinton's strategy has included: an
    Executive Order to help track down Federal workers who fail to pay child support and
    collection of Federal income tax refunds from delinquent parents. And most significantly,
    the welfare reform law includes tough child support measures that President Clinton has
    long supported; including: a national new hire reporting system; streamlined paternity
    establishment; uniform interstate child support laws; computerized state-wide collections;
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
       and tough new penalties; these five measures are projected to increase child support
       collections by an additional $24 billion over the riext ten years. But the job is not finished,
       there are still states that have not implemented the tough, state-wide child support
       collection mechanisms required by law; measures that will significantly reduce many
       parents' dependency on welfare. [Source: HHS Press release, 4114/96; Executive Order
       12953,2/27/95; HHS press release, 10/23/96; Child Support Collection Fact Sheet, 6/97]

      Breaking the Cycle of Dependency - Preventing Teen Pregnancy: Significant
       components of the President's comprehensive effort to reduce teen pregnancy became law
       when the President signed the 1996 Personal Responsibility Act. The law requires
       unmarried minor parents to stay in school and live at home or in a supervised setting;
       encourages "second chance homes" to provide teen parents with the skills and support
       they need; and provides $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education
       activities. Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has supported innovative and
       promising teen pregnancy prevention strategies; HHS-supported programs already reach
       about 30 percent or 1,410 communities in the United States. As part of this effort, the
       National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, a private nonprofit organization, was
       formed in response to the President's 1995 State of the Union challenge to prevent teen
       pregnancy. Notably, data shows we are making progress in reducing teen pregnancy --
       teen births have fallen four years in a row, by 8 percent from 1991 to 1995.

     BALANCED BUDGET HELPS MOVE PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

      $3 Billion to Help Move 1 Million People from Welfare to Work: Because of the
       President's leadership, the balanced budget includes the total funding requested by the
       President for the creation of his $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge fund. This
       program will help states and local communities move long-term welfare recipients into
       lasting, unsubsidized jobs. These funds can be used for job creation, job placement and
       job retention efforts, including wage subsidies to private employers and other critical
       post-employment support services. The Labor Department will provide oversight but the
       dollars will be placed, through the Private Industry Councils, in the hands of the localities
       who are on the front lines ofthe welfare reform effort.

      A Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit for Employers: This tax credit will give employers an
       added incentive to hire long-term welfare recipients by providing a credit equal to 35
       percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the first year of employment, and 50 percent of
       the first $10,000 in wages in the second year, paid to new hires who have received
       welfare for an extended period. The credit is for two years per worker to encourage not
       only hiring, but also retention.

       PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE AND RESTORING FAIRNESS

The President made a commitment last year to fix several provisions in the welfare reform law
that had nothing to do with moving people from welfare to work. As he said, "I am determined
to work with the Congress in a bipartisan effort to correct the provisions of this legislation that
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

go too far and have nothing to do with welfare refonn." After months when the Congressional
leadership refused to consider these changes, the President fought for and ultimately was
successful in ensuring that the balanced budget protect the most vulnerable.

      Protects Children by Keeping the Medicaid Guarantee: The balanced budget
       preserves the Federal guarantee of Medicaid coverage for the vulnerable populations who
       depend on it, and contains additional investments to extend coverage to uninsured
       children. Also ensures that 30,000 disabled children losing SSI because of the new
       tighter eligibility criteria keep their Medicaid coverage.

      Protects Immigrants Currently Receiving Benefits: Restores both SSI and Medicaid
       benefits for immigrants now receiving assistance, ensuring that they will not be turned
       out of their apartments or nursing homes or otherwise left destitute. And for immigrants
       already here but not receiving benefits, the balanced budget does not change the rules
       retroactively. Immigrants in the country as of August 22, 1996 but not receiving benefits
       at that time who subsequently become disabled will also be fully eligible for SSI and
       Medicaid benefits.

     Helps People Who Want to Work but Can't Find a Job: The balanced budget
      provides for 235,000 more work slots for food stamp recipients. Last year's welfare
      refonn bill restricted food stamps for able-bodied childless adults to only 3 out of every
      36 months, unless they were working. This move ignored the fact that finding a job
      often takes time. The budget bill provides nearly $1 billion for an estimated 235,000
      work slots over 5 years and food stamp benefits to those who are willing to work but,
      through no fault of their own, have not yet found employment. The balanced budget
      allows states to exempt up to 15 percent of the food stamp recipients (70,000 individuals
      monthly) who would otherwise be denied benefits as a result of the "3 in 36" limit.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

    PRESIDENT CLINTON HAILS SUCCESS OF WELFARE REFORM ONE YEAR
                 AFTER SIGNING REFORM BILL INTO LAW
                             August 12, 1997

Today, President Clinton hailed the success of welfare refonn nearly one year after making
welfare reform the law of the land, announcing that caseloads have declined by almost 3.4
million or 24% since he took office in January 1993. The President also highlighted his
successes in the Balanced Budget Act, which fixes the problems he had promised to fix when he
signed the welfare bill and includes a welfare-to-work tax credit and a $3 billion fund to help
move a million more people from welfare to work. Today the President praised the
public-private partnership forming in St. Louis, where over [200] companies have accepted his
challenge to hire welfare recipients. The President announced that the Welfare to Work
Partnership stands ready to help companies all across the nation hire people off welfare, with
their "Blueprint for Business" and other infonnation available starting today through their toll
free hotline and their web page.

One Year Later: Welfare Reform is Working
On August 22nd a year ago, President Clinton took the bold step of finally ending welfare as we
know it. There was a lot of debate at the time over whether this bold experiment would work.
We still have more to do. But today, the old debate is over: welfare reform works.

President Clinton announced new statistics today showing that the welfare caseload has fallen by
1.4 million recipients since last August and by almost 3.4 million recipients since January 1993.
The decline from 14.1 million recipients in January 1993 to 10.7 million in May 1997, a drop of
24%, is the largest decrease in the welfare rolls in history, giving us the lowest percentage of the
population on welfare since 1970. Forty-eight out of fifty states have seen their caseloads
decline, with eleven states reducing their rolls by 40% or more in the last four years. This
progress started even before President Clinton signed the welfare bill, with the waivers he
granted to 43 states to require work, time-limit assistance, make work pay, improve child support
enforcement, and encourage parental responsibility.

The New Balanced Budget will Help Us Do More
Because of President Clinton's leadership, the balanced budget includes $3 billion Welfare to
Work Jobs Challenge and an expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit to help move long-tenn
welfare recipients into jobs and meet the President's goal of moving a million more people from
welfare to work by the year 2000. The new balanced budget also makes good on the President's
promise to restore disability and health benefits to legal immigrants, continue Medicaid coverage
for disabled children, and provide funds for workslots for unemployed food stamp recipients --
all budget cuts attached to the welfare law which had nothing to do with the real purpose of
welfare reform, moving people from welfare to work.

The Critical Role of the Private Sector
Today in st. Louis, President Clinton will underscore the critical role of the private sector in
welfare reform, praising the [200] St. Louis companies that are committing to hire and retain
welfare recipients. Today's event is sponsored by the Welfare to Work Partnership, the national
                                                                     Hex.-Dwnp Conversion

business effort to hire people from the welfare rolls which was launched in May 1997 at the
urging of the President. Today the Partnership will unveil several new tools to help companies
that want to hire workers nom the welfare rolls: a toll free hotline (1-888-VSA-JOB1) and a
web site (www.welfaretowork.org) to link companies to public and private sector welfare reform
information; a guide for companies hiring welfare recipients, Blueprint for Business: Reaching a
New Work Force, prepared with the National Alliance of Business; and a public service
campaign that highlights the benefits to companies of hiring welfare recipients and encourages
companies to join the Partnership.

The Partnership is a nonpartisan, non-profit orgaI).ization of over 500 businesses committed to
hiring former welfare recipients. The Partnership is committed to providing information,
technical assistance, and support for businesses so that they can successfully meet their
commitment to hire and retain welfare recipients without displacement.

Speaking at today's program in St. Louis are Bob Shapiro, CEO of Monsanto, Barry Corona,
Chair of the board of Mid.Tec and [president] of Production Products, [a former welfare recipient
now working at....], and President Clinton. The ceremony is being held at Mid.Tec, a
consortium of 250 small-to-medium sized manufacturers that helps members improve their
global competitiveness by providing state of the art training to new employees. The training
program targets low-income individuals and welfare recipients for specific jobs.
