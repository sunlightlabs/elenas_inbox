               Suggested Items for Community Empowerment Meeting



1.   Some Possible Sub-Groups

           Housing -- Possible issues include expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax
            Credit, more expansive program of vouchers.

           Transportation - Moving people in the inner cities to jobs.

           Credit issues -- This one is tough, we have actually done quite a bit in this
            area with the President's reform of CRA and the CDFI program. One
            possible area would be a major expansion of microenterprise lending.
            Another idea would be Individual Development Accounts.

           Tax incentives -- We should look closely at tax incentives along the same vein
            as brownfields. e.g. combining both urban and environmental policy.
            Brownfields is unique in that it is supported by the cities and suburbs.
            Another incentive that we have developed is the Waterfront Tax Credit.
            Treasury however, has not yet approved. The credit would be available for
            commercial and residential properties that are on waterfronts and which put
            into place anti-water pollution devices to combat non-point source pollution
            (like runoff from parking lots).

           Education

           Metropolitan regional strategies

           We1fare-to-work

           Unbanked-- Treasury has been working on this for awhile.

           Training/mentoring -- A big issue with Secretary Rubin and Hugh Price.
            One idea was to use the National Guard to mentor kids in the inner city and
            use their facilities. This stuff tends to get a little fuzzy.

2.   Potential AgencylDepartment Participation

           Treasury
           HUD
           Commerce
           Education
           Labor
           SBA




                                                                         Automated Records Manage~ent System
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
               HHS
               Transportation
               White House (DPC, NEC, CEB/OVP, CEA, CEQ, OMB)

    3.   Process Issues

               How this relates to the race initiative (four policy groups)

                          Community Empowerment
                          Education
                          Health
                          Administration of Justice

               Decision-making: nonnal NEC-DPC process
