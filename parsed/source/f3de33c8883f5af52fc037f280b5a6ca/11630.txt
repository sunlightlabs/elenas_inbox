Draft 3/9/99
   TITLE V B PROMOTING EQUITY, EXCELLENCE, AND PUBLIC SCHOOL
                            CHOICE

                               Section-by-Section Analysis

        Among other things, new title V of[NAME OF BILL] would: (I) improve the
Magnet Schools Assistance program by adding emphasis on projects that consider the
diversity of the student populations and that have the capacity to continue after the
Federal grant has run out; (2) move Charter Schools, from Part C of Title X of the ESEA,
to Part B of Title V of the ESEA; (3) add a new initiative, Public Choice School, that
would provide a flexible authority to support State and local educational agencies in
experimenting with different kinds of public elementary and secondary schools, such as
worksite and College-based schools; (4) reauthorize the Woman=s Educational Equity
program, but move it to Part [-] of the Title V of the ESEA; and (5) repeal the Assistance
to Address School Dropout Problems program, currently in Part C of Title V of the
ESEA. Each ofthe new title V programs would be reauthorized for five years. [THERE
ARE LIKELY TO BE OTHER PROGRAMS REAUTHORIZED, LIKE FIE,
THAT WILL GO INTO THIS TITLE.]

       Magnet School Assistance:

Section SOl. Section 501 of the bill, ARenaming the Title,@ would change the name of
title V of the ESEA to APromoting Equity, Excellence, and Public School Choice@.

        Section 502. Section 502 of the bill would amend Part A, the AMagnet School
Assistance Program,@ of Title V ofthe ESEA. Section 502 (a) of the bill would make
editorial changes to, and update, section 5101 of the ESEA, the findings for the Magnet
School Assistance Program.

       Section 502(b) of the bill would amend section 5102(3) of the ESEA, AStatement
ofPurpose,@ to clarify that the purpose of providing financial assistance to develop and
design innovative educational methods and practices is to promote diversity and increase
choices in public elementary and secondary schools and educational programs.

        Section 502(c) of the bill would amend section 51 06(b )(1 )(D) of the ESEA,
Alnformation and Assurances@ (a part of the application requirements), to eliminate
reference to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and to correct a section number.

        Section 502(d) of the bill would amend section 5107 of the ESEA, APriority,@ to
eliminate the current priorities for greatest need and new, or significantly revised,
projects. These priorities are not well defined and have not helped to determine which
grant applications are most deserving. Section 502(d) would also add a new priority for
projects that propose activities, which may include professional development, that will
build local capacity to operate the magnet program once Federal assistance has ended.
                          Hex-Dump Conversion

        Section S02(e) of the bill would amend section S108(a) of the ESEA, AUses of
Funds,@ to: (1) revise paragraph (3) to allow for the payment, or subsidization of the
compensation, of elementary and secondary school teachers who are certified or licensed
by the State, and instructional staff who have expertise and professional skills necessary
for the conduct of programs in magnet schools or a baccalaureate degree, an equivalent
degree, or who demonstrate knowledge, experience, or skills in the relevant field of
expertise; and (2) allow grantees to use funds for activities, including professional
development, that will build the applicant=s capacity to operate the magnet program once
Federal assistance has ended.

       Section S02(f) oqhe bill would repeal section SIll of the ESEA, AInnovative
Programs@. This program is limited by the requirements of Part A; its activities are
subsumed under the new Public School Choice program.

        Section S02(g) of the bill would redesignate current section S112 of the ESEA,
AEvaluation, Technical Assistance, and Dissemination@, as section SIll, and incorporate
its requirements into a new section, ANational Activities@, that would authorize the
Secretary to reserve not more than five percent (rather than two percent) of appropriated
funds in any fiscal year to evaluate the program, as well as provide technical assistance to
applicants and grantees and collect and disseminate information on successful magnet
school programs. Section S02(g) ofthe bill would also require each evaluation, in
addition to current items, to address the extent to which magnet school programs continue
once grant assistance under this part ends.

       Section S02(h) of the bill would amend section Sl13(a) of the ESEA,
AAuthorization@, to authorize such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2001 and for
each of the four succeeding fiscal years to be appropriated to carry out the part. Section
SOl(h) of the bill would also redesignate section Sll3 as section Sl12.

MINOR UPDATING OF THE PROGRAM IS ANTICIPATED.J

       Redesignation of the Public Charter Schools Program:

       Section S03(c) of the bill would redesignate the Public Charter Schools Program,
which is currently Part C of Title X of the ESEA, as Part B of title V of the ESEA.
Section S02(c) would also make necessary conforming changes to carry out the
redesignation.

       Public School Choice Program:
                         Hex-Dump Conversion

      . Section 504 of the bill would amend title V of the ESEA to add a new Part C,
APublic School Choice Program@, that would authorize a flexible, competitive grant
program to help State and local agencies provide innovative, high-quality public school
choice programs.

        New section 5301 of the ESEA would set forth the findings of the new part and
state that its purpose is to identify and support innovative approaches to high-quality
public school choice by providing financial assistance for the demonstration,
development, implementation, evaluation of, and dissemination of information about
public school choice projects that stimulate educational innovation for all public schools
and contribute to standards-based school reform efforts.

        New section 5302(a) of the ESEA would authorize the Secretary, from funds
appropriated under section 5305(a) and not reserved under section 5305(b), to make
grants to State and local educational agencies to support programs that promote
innovative approaches- to high-quality public school choice. New section 5301 (b) of the
ESEA would prohibit grants under this part from exceeding three years.

         New section 5303(a) of the ESEA would authorize funds under the part to be used
to demonstrate, develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate information on innovative
approaches to broaden public school choice. Examples of such approaches at the school,
district, and State levels would be: (1) inter-district approaches to public school choice,
including approaches that increase equal access to high-quality educational programs and
diversity in schools; (2) public elementary and secondary programs that involve
partnerships with institutions of higher education and that are located on the campuses of
those institutions; (3) programs that allow students in public secondary schools to enroll
in postsecondary courses and to receive both secondary and postsecondary academic
credit; (4) worksite satellite schools, in which State or local educational agencies form
partnerships with public or private employers, to create public schools at parents= place
of employment; and (5) approaches to school desegregation that provide students and
parents choice through strategies other than magnet schools.

       New section 5303(b) of the ESEA would require that funds under this part: (1)
supplement, and not supplant, non-federal funds expended for existing programs; (2) not
be used for transportation; and (3) not be used to fund projects that are specifically
authorized under Parts A and B of this title.

        New section 5304(a) of the ESEA would require a State or local educational
agency desiring to receive a grant under this part to submit an application to the
Secretary, in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary may require.
Each application would be required to include: (1) a description of the program for which
funds are sought and the goals for such program; (2) a description of how the program
funded under this part will be coordinated with, and will complement and enhance,
programs under other related Federal and non-federal projects; (3) if the program includes
partners, the name of each partner and a description of its responsibilities; (4) a
description of the policies and procedures the applicant will use to ensure its
                            Hex-Dump COllversion


accountability for results, including its goals and performance indicators, and that the
program is open and accessible to, and will promote high-academic standards for, all
students. The Secretary would be authorized to give special consideration to
applications demonstrating that the applicant will carry out its project in partnership with
one or more public and private agencies, organizations, and institutions, including
institutions of higher education and public and private employers.

        New section 5305(a) of the ESEA would authorize such sums as may be
necessary for each of the fiscal years 2001 through 2001 to be appropriated to carry out
the part. Section 5305(b) of the ESEA would, from amounts appropriated for any fiscal
year, authorize the Secretary to reserve not more than five percent to carry out
evaluations, provide technical assistance, and disseminate information. Section 5305(c)
would authorize the Secretary to use funds reserved under subsection (b) to carry out one
or more evaluations of programs assisted under this part. Those evaluations would, at a
minimum, address: (1) how and the extent to which the programs supported with funds
under the part promote educational equity and excellence; and (2) the extent to which
public schools of choice supported with funds under the part are held accountable to the
public, effective in improving public education, and open and accessible to all students.

Draft 3/9/99
TITLE V B PROMOTING EQUITY, EXCELLENCE, AND PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE
RENAMING THE TITLE
       SEC. 50 I. The heading for Title V of the ESEA is amended to read as follows:
A TITLE V -- PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE AND INNOVATION@.
[THE NUMBER AND ORDER OF PROGRAMS UNDER THIS TITLE HAS NOT YET
BEEN DETERMINED)
AMENDMENTS TO THE MAGNET SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
        SEC. 502. (a) FINDINGS. Section 5101 ofthe ESEA is amended to read as follows:
AFINDINGS
        ASEC. 5101. The Congress finds as follows:
                A(I) Magnet schools are a significant part of our Nation's effort to achieve voluntary
desegregation in our Nation's schools.
                A(2) It is in the national interest to desegregate and diversifY those schools in our
Nation that are racially, economically, linguistically, or ethnically segregated. Such segregation
exists between minority and non-minority students as well as among students of different minority
groups.
                A(3) Desegregation can help increase rates of high school graduation and college
attendance, and can promote better occupational prospects for students who have attended
integrated schools.
                A(4) Desegregation can provide students with valuable experience that prepares
them to function in a diverse society and can help break down longstanding patterns of racial
isolation in adult social relationships.
        A(5) Despite ongoing desegregation efforts in the Nation--
                A(A) almost one-third of our elementary and secondary schools continue to be
        schools with 50 percent or more minority students;
                A(B) more than two-thirds of minority students attend schools with 50 percent or
        more minority students, and almost half of minority studcnts attcnd schools with 75 percent
        or more minority students;
                A(C) almost one-third of non-minority students attend schools with less than 10
        percent minority students;
                A(D) almost one-quarter of Black students attend schools with 90 percent or more
        Black students; and
                A(E) almost one-third of Hispanic students attend schools with 75 percent or more
        Hispanic students.
                A(6) Local educational agencies= use of magnet schools has increased dramatically
since the of enactment of the Magnet Schools Assistance program, thus increasing public school
options for the approximately two million students nationwide now attending such schools, of
which more than 65 percent ofthe students are minority.
                A(7) Magnet schools offer a wide range of distinctive programs that have served as
models for school improvement efforts.
                A(8) In administering the Magnet Schools Assistance program, the Federal
Government has leamed that--
                            Hex-Dump Conversion

                          A(A) where magnet programs are implemented for only a portion of a
school's student body, special efforts must be made to discourage the isolation of--
