     SUBJECT:        CREATING A SINGLE FOOD SAFETY AGENCY

      The current food safety system is criticized for its fragmentation, lack of coordination,
     inconsistencies in inspection coverage, non-uniform enforcement authorities, and inefficient
      distribution of resources. A single agency that combined the food safety programs of USDA,
      HHSIFDA, and the seafood inspection activities of the Department of Commerce could address
      these concems. ,A single food safety agency would:

             Eliminate many unnecessary activities, such as overlapping research and duplicate
              inspection of establishments that produce products regulated by different agencies;
             Improve the coordination ofFederal responses to foodborne illness outbreaks by
              eliminating gaps in regulatory coverage, avoiding conflicting actions, and ensuring a
              comprehensive Federal response; and
             Allow for better allocation of scarce Federal food safety resources based on the risk that
              different commoditities pose to public health (e.g., over twice as much is spent on meat
              and poultry inspection as on inspection fQr all other foods), and better responses to
              changing consumption pattems and emerging food safety issues.

     This single food safety agency could be either: (1) a new, stand-alone food safety agency, or (2)
     under the auspices of an existing department. Given the need for this agency to have a clear
     public health mission, if placed in an existing department, HHS would be the most appropriate
     home. USDA's mission is broader than HHS' and encompasses an industry promotion
     responsibility, which could conflict with a food safety agency's regulatory responsibilities.

     Option 1:      Create a new stand-alone agency
           Would highlight food safety issues; food safety issues would be the agency's top priority.
           Would limit interest group opposition. The meat and poultry industry, and therefore the
            Agriculture Committees, strongly oppose moving food safety activities into HHS because
            they fear this might result in undesirable changes or rapid streamlining of the inspection
            system and because they believe USDA is better positioned to take a "farm-to-table"
            approach to food safety. (Note: USDA and FDA share the same appropriations
            subcommittee. )
           Would limit Federal agency opposition. USDA opposed a proposal included in the first
            National Performance Review (NPR) report to consolidate the food safety functions
            within FDA; HHS would likely oppose a similar consolidation offood safety activities
            within USDA.
         . Is consistent with a recent legislative proposal of Senators Durbin and Torricelli and
            Representatives Fazio and Pallone.

     Option 2:     Consolidate food safety programs within BBS
          May appear to reduce the Federal bureaucracy rather than enlarge it.
          May allow for better coordination and the leveraging of resources among all agencies
           with public health mandates.
          Would have direct cabinet access through the HHS Secretary.
          Is consistent with the 1993 NPR proposal to form a single food safety agency.
          May have lower administrative costs than creating a new, independent agency because it
           would be able to share the overhead resources ofHHS.
