                  PRESIDENT CLINTON USES LINE-ITEM VETO
                  ON DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 1998

                                     October 14, 1997


   President Clinton used the line-item veto today to cancel l3 projects in the Defense
    Appropriations Act of 1998.

   The President's action will save $144 million in budget authority in 1998.

   The Defense Appropriations Act included funding for over 750 projects, costing about
    $11 billion, that the President did not request in his 1998 budget.

           -- The Administration carefully reviewed those unrequested projects and found
           that while most of them have merit, some do not.

   The Administration has chosen criteria that are appropriate to each appropriations bill
    under review.

   For the Defense Appropriations Act, the President considered such factors as:

           -- whether he requested the projects in his 1998 budget,

           -- whether they contribute to our national security, and

           -- whether they fit with our long-range defense plans.

   The President's action will in no way adversely affect our military capability, the
    readiness of our forces, or their operations in defense of our Nation.

           -- The Defense Department has determined there is no national security
           requirement for these projects.

   The President left thousands of projects in the bill, including the vast majority that
    Congress added, reflecting his commitment to the military readiness of American forces
    and Congress' role in shaping appropriations bills.

           -- In fact, his actions mean that he has agreed to a net addition of about $1 billion
           in Defense Department funding above the level in the Bipartisan Budget
           Agreement.




                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
                                 THE LINE ITEM VETO ACT


     o   Scope of Authority. President may cancel any item of discretionary or direct
         spending or any limited tax benefit, if he sends a special message to Congress
         identifying the item within 5 days (excluding Sundays) of signing the bill
         containing the item.

     o   Cancellations transmitted to Congress are effective upon receipt by Congress,
         and remain effective unless overturned by a disapproval law.

     o   The item veto may only be used on items in bills the President signs --he may not
         veto items that become law without his signature.

     o   Defmition of Item. The President may cancel (not reduce) whole individual
         "items" of discretionary spending --defmed as any dollar. amount in an
         appropriations bill or report, or any amount required to be allocated by a
         specific proviso in a bill or represented separately in explanatory text in a
         report.

     o   President may cancel only the amount of spending --not conditions or
         restrictions on spending.

     o   The President may also cancel any "item of new direct spending" --defmed as a
         specific provision of law estimated to result in an increase in direct spending,
         relative to the baseline.

     o   Limited Tax Benefits. "Limited tax benefits" that may be canceled include only
         revenue-losing provisions applying to 100 or fewer beneficiaries in a fiscal year
         (where the beneficiaries are not similarly treated), or transitional relief to 10 or
         fewer beneficiaries. Congress may specify in tax legislation whether the bill
         contains any provisions subject to cancellation authority.

     o   Lockbox.    Includes a "lockbox" mechanism: discretionary cancellations
         trigger automatic cap reductions, and paygo savings from cancellations are not
         put on paygo scorecard.

     o Conl!ressional Drocedure. The Congress has 30 session days following a
       cancellation message to consider disapproval legislation, under expedited
       procedures.

     o   Disapproval bills introduced in the House must disapprove all cancellations
         made with respect to a particular law. Bills introduced in the Senate may select
         particular cancellations. However, the bills may be amended in both chambers
         to alter the list of cancellations.
                                                                           렁~ement System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion


o   Effective dates. Item veto authority became effective on January 1, 1997 and
    will sunset on January 1,2005.


                                                                Automated Records Management System

                               CANCELLATION OF
            DOLLAR AMOUNT OF DISCRETIONARY BUDGET AUTHORITY
                Report Pursuant to the Line Item Veto Act, P.L. 104-130

     Bill Citation: "Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1998" (H.R. 2266)

     1(A). Dollar Amount of Discretionary Budget Authority: $30,000 thousand for
     Operation and Maintenance, Air Force project "SR-71" on page 75 of House Report
     105-265 dated September 23,1997.

     1(B). Determinations: This cancellation will reduce the Federal budget deficit, will not
     impair any essential Government functions, and will not harm the national interest.

     1(C),(E). Reasons for Cancellation; Facts, Circumstances, and Considerations
     Relating to or Bearing upon the Cancellation; and Estimated Effect of Cancellation
     on Objects, Purposes, and Programs: This project would provide manning,
     operations and support to sustain SR-71 training requirements during fiscal year 1998 and
     provide for a 30-day operational deployment capability. The SR-71 is a high-speed,
     high-altitude, long-range, multi-sensor, all-weather, wide-area surveillance aircraft.
     There is no military requirement to continue to operate the SR-71. The project is
     being canceled because it was not requested in the President's FY 1998 Budget and
     the Department of Defense has determined that it would not make a significant
     contribution to US military capability.

     1(D). Estimated Fiscal, Economic, and Budgetary Effect of Cancellation: As a
     result of the cancellation, Federal outlays will not increase, as specified below. This will
     have a commensurate effect on the Federal budget deficit and, to that extent, will have a
     beneficial effect on the economy.

       DOLLAR AMOUNT OF DISCRETIONARY BUDGET AUTHORITY
           Report Pursuant to the Line Item Veto Act, P.L. 104-130

Bill Citation:   "Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1998" (H.R. 2266)

I(A). Dollar Amount of Discretionary Budget Authority: $4,000 th,ousand for the
Research, Development Test and Evaluation, Army project titled "Gallo Center" on

Report 105-206 dated July 25,1997.

1(B). Determinations: This cancellation will reduce the Federal budget deficit, will
not impair any essential Government functions, and will not harm the national
interest.

1(C),(E). Reasons for Cancellation; Facts, Circumstances, and Considerations

on Objects, Purposes, and Programs: The President's FY 1998 Budget supports
ongoing work to demonstrate and export new environmentally acceptable
technology to the industrial base and to train the industrial base on the use of new
technology. The appropriated increase would support life-cycle environmental and
manufacturing technologies research specifically related to weapons systems and
munitions technology assessment and analysis. The Army does not believe this
additional research merits funding at this time.

result of the cancellation, Federal outlays will not increase, as specified below. This
will have a commensurate effect on the Federal budget deficit and, to that extent,

TEXT:
Message Creation Date was at 14-0CT-1997 12:25:00

Due to last-minute changes, the specific line-item veto details have changed a
bit since Jack Lew briefed the senior White House staff this morning.  The
attached is the actual press paper that will go out later today.  You can
educate yourselves about where we are by referring to it.  PLEASE DO NOT
DISTRIBUTE this paper outside of the White House, however, until at least
Raines, et. al., brief the press at 1:30 p.m.
 Thank you.

                  PRESIDENT CLINTON USES LINE-ITEM VETO
                  ON DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 1998

                                      October 14, 1997


    President Clinton used the line-item veto today to cancel 13 projects in the Defense
     Appropriations Act of 1998.

    The President's action will save $144 million in budget authority in 1998.

    The Defense Appropriations Act included funding for over 750 projects, costing about
     $11 billion, that the President did not request in his 1998 budget.

            -- The Administration carefully reviewed those unrequested projects and found
            that while most of them have merit, some do not.

    The Administration has chosen criteria that are appropriate to each appropriations bill
     under review.

    For the Defense Appropriations Act, the President considered such factors as:

            -- whether he requested the projects in his 1998 budget,

            -- whether they contribute to our national security, and

            -- whether they fit with our long-range defense plans.

    The President's action will in no way adversely affect our military capability, the
     readiness of our forces, or their operations in defense of our Nation.

            -- The Defense Department has determined there is no national security
            requirement for these projects.

    The President left thousands of projects in the bill, including the vast majority that
     Congress added, reflecting his commitment to the military readiness of American forces
     and Congress' role in shaping appropriations bills.

            -- In fact, his actions mean that he has agreed to a net addition of about $1 billion
            in Defense Department funding above the level in the Bipartisan Budget
            Agreement.
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
                           THE LINE ITEM VETO ACT


o   Scope of Authority. President may cancel any item of discretionary or direct
    spending or any limited tax benefit, if he sends a special message to Congress
    identifying the item within 5 days (excluding Sundays) of signing the bill
    containing the item.

o   Cancellations transmitted to Congress are effective upon receipt by Congress,
    and remain effective unless overturned by a disapproval law.

o The item veto may only be used on items in bills the President signs --he may not
  veto items that become law without his signature.

o Defmition of Item. The President may cancel (not reduce) whole individual
  "items" of discretionary spending --defmed as any dollar amount in an
  appropriations bill or report, or any amount required to be allocated by a
  specific proviso in a bill or represented separately in explanatory text in a
  report.

o   President may cancel only the amount of spending --not conditions or
    restrictions on spending.

o   The President may also cancel any "item of new direct spending" --defmed as a
    specific provision of law estimated to result in an increase in direct spending,
    relative to the baseline.

o Limited Tax Benefits. "Limited tax benefits" that may be canceled include only
  revenue-losing provisions applying to 100 or fewer beneficiaries in a fiscal year
  (where the beneficiaries are not similarly treated), or transitional relief to 10 or
  fewer beneficiaries. Congress may specify in tax legislation whether the bill
  contains any provisions subject to cancellation authority.

o Lockbox. Includes a "Iockbox" mechanism:           discretionary cancellations
  trigger automatic cap reductions, and paygo savings from cancellations are not
  put on paygo scorecard.

o Congressional procedure. The Congress has 30 session days following. a
  cancellation message to consider disapproval legislation, under expedited
  procedures.

o   Disapproval bills introduced in the House must disapprove all cancellations
    made with respect to a particular law. Bills introduced in the Senate may select
    particular cancellations. However, the bills may be amended in both chambers
    to alter the list of cancellations.

     o   Effective dates. Item veto authority became effective on January 1, 1997 and
         will sunset on January 1, 2005.

                          CANCELLATION OF
       DOLLAR AMOUNT OF DISCRETIONARY BUDGET AUTHORITY
           Report Pursuant to the Line Item Veto Act, P.L. 104-130

Bill Citation: "Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1998" (H.R. 2266)

l(A). Dollar Amount of Discretionary Budget Authority: $30,000 thousand for
Operation and Maintenance, Air Force project "SR-71" on page 75 of House Report
105-265 dated September 23,1997.

1(B). Determinations: This cancellation will reduce the Federal budget deficit, will not
impair any essential Government functions, and will not harm the national interest.

l(C),(E). Reasons for Cancellation; Facts, Circumstances, and Considerations
Relating to or Bearing upon the Cancellation; and Estimated Effect of Cancellation
on Objects, Purposes, and Programs: This project would provide manning,
operations and support to sustain SR-71 training requirements during fiscal year 1998 and
provide for a 30-day operational deployment capability. The SR-71 is a high-speed,
high-altitude, long-range, multi-sensor, all-weather, wide-area surveillance aircraft.
There is no military requirement to continue to operate the SR-7!. The project is
being canceled because it was not requested in the President's FY 1998 Budget and
the Department of Defense has determined that it would not make a significant
contribution to US military capability.

1(D). Estimated Fiscal, Economic, and Budgetary Effect of Cancellation: As a
result of the cancellation, Federal outlays will not increase, as specified below. This will
have a commensurate effect on the Federal budget deficit and, to that extent, will have a
beneficial effect on the economy.

                                               Outlay Changes (in thousands of dollars)

      FY 1998        FY 1999         FY 2000        FY 2001         FY2002            Total

1(F). Adjustments to Defense Discretionary Spending Limits
      Budget Authority:          -$30,000 thousand in FY 1998
      Outlays:                   The estimated outlay effect for each year is
shown above.

       Evaluation of Effects of These Adjustments upon Sequestration Procedures:

demonstration experiment to prove the feasibility of launching a seeker that would
smash into an enemy's satellite, thereby disabling it. However, alternative means
exist for addressing a satellite threat, such as destroying ground stations or
disrupting satellite communications links. This item is being canceled because it
was not requested in the President's FY 1998 Budget; it was not in the Department of
Defense Future Years Defense Plan; and there are alternative ways to disrupt enemy
satellite capabilities.
