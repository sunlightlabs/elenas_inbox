TEXT:
Here is an updated announcement -- the major change is that the EEOC and
DOL would prefer to have one MOU rather than two.  In addition, here is a
first cut at Q&A-- let me know if there are additional questions.   Can we
get the CEA to draft an answer using the data they looked on the wage
disparities? Let me know what changes, additions, etc.' you all have.

DRAFT 3-30-98
                 THE VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR
             . LEGISLATION ON PAY EQUITY AND ADMINISTRATION
                INITIATIVES TO COMBAT WAGE DISCRIMINATION
                                 April 2, 1998

Today the Vice President will announce the Administration's support for legislation, introduced
today by Senator Daschle and Congresswomen DeLauro, (check) to improve enforcement of
wage discrimination against women and to strengthen the remedy provisions in the Equal Pay
Act to allow for compensatory and punitive damages. The Vice President also will announce
several Administration initiatives aimed at enhancing enforcement of wage discrimination both
in the private sector and the federal government. The Vice President will announce the
development of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor to cross-train their staffs to be sensitive to
potential violations of the laws they enforce, including the Equal Pay Act, and to help the
Department of Labor to collect damages under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The
Vice President also will announce a ten-step voluntary self-audit for both private businesses and
the federal agencies in order to help them monitor their efforts on equal pay. Finally, the Vice
President will announce the "Guide to Recruitment and Retention of Women" in the federal
government, a manual designed to assist agency managers hire and retain talented women.

Increasing Enforcement of Wage Discrimination. The Vice President will call on Congress
to pass the legislation introduced today which strengthens current laws that prohibit wage
discrimination and provides training and outreach. to help enforce these laws. The highlights of
this legislation include:

      Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act. This legislation amends the Equal Pay Act to
       allow for compensatory and punitive damages. Currently, the EPA only provides for
       liquidated damages and back pay awards.

      Non-retaliation Provision. This legislation amends the Equal Pay Act (EPA) to prohibit
       employers from penalizing employees for sharing information about their salaries with
       coworkers.

      Class Actions. The bill amends the procedures for filing class actions under the
       EPA to conform with the general procedural rules for filing federal class actions in
       other areas of the law.

      Training, Research, Education, and Outreach. The bill requires the EEOC to
       provide training for its employees, subject to the availability of funding, on matters
       involving discrimination in the payment of wages. The bill also enhances programs
       already in place at the Department of Labor, requiring DOL to undertake research
       in the area of sex-based pay disparities; provide information on means of
       eradicating such disparities; assist State and local information and educational
       programs; recognize and promote the achievements of employers that have made
       strides to eliminate pay disparities; and convene a national summit to discuss and
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
       highlight the issue of sex-based pay disparities.

      Pay Equity Award. The bill establishes "The National Award for Pay Equity in the
       Workplace," to be administered by the Department of Labor, to recognize and
       promote the achievements of employers that have made strides to eliminate pay
       disparities.

Providing Data Analysis, Technical Assistance, and Enhanced Enforcement of Wage
Discrimination. The Vice President also will announce a number of Administration initiatives
that will supplement the legislation introduced today. These initiatives will provide increased
analysis of data on 'the wage gap; assist federal agencies in enforcing wage discrimination law;
provide technical assistance by highlighting "best practices" and offering a voluntary self-audit
on the Internet; and strengthen the role of the Federal Government in hiring and retaining
qualified women. These initiatives are:

      Increased Data Analysis on Pay Equity. The Vice President will announce an annual
       report on the pay gap by sex produced by the Department of Labor. This easy-to~access
       report will raise the national prominence of wage disparities and will highlight the issue
       every year in order to spur Americans to achieve increased gender pay equity.

      Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) between EEOC and DOL to Cross Train and
       Collect Damages. The Vice President will urge the Department of Labor and the EEOC
       to work together to develop a MOU between the EEOC and the Department of Labor to
       train each other's staff to be sensitive to potential violations of the statutes they enforce,
       including the Equal Pay Act, and to assist referrals of potential violations to the
       applicable EEOC or Labor Department office for appropriate action. In addition, this
       MOU will be developed to permit the Department of Labor's Office of Federal
       Contractor Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to serve as the EEOC's agent for purposes of
       collecting damages that are not otherwise collectible by OFCCP, including relieffor
       intentional discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

      Federal Contractor Best Practices. The Department of Labor will begin to
       publicize successful programs of federal contractors by placing them on the
       Department of Labor's web site.

      lO-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Businesses and Employees. The Department of Labor
       will place on the Internet a 1O-step package that would give companies guidelines in
       order to determine whether they offer equal pay, hiring, and promotional opportunities.
       A similar checklist for employees will also be placed on the Internet.

      lO-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Agencies. The Vice President will announce that the
       federal agencies will take the 10-step self-audit developed by the Department of Labor
       and use the results from the self-audit to monitor their efforts on equal pay.

      Guide to Recruitment and Retention of Women. The Vice President will announce
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

OPM's new Guide on Recruitment and Retention of Women in the federal government
which contains information to make agency managers aware of career opportunities for
women and to provide guidance on recruitment and career development for women.
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

                       QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON PAY EQUITY
                                    April 2, 1998

Q:    What is Equal Pay Day?

A:    It is the day on which American women's wages, added to their previous year's earnings,
      equal what men make in just one calendar year.

Q:    What did the Vice President announce today?

A:    The Vice President announced the Administration's support for legislation introduced by
      Senator Daschle to improve the enforcement of wage discrimination against women and
      to strengthen the remedy provisions in the Equal Pay Act to allow for compensatory and
      punitive damages. The Vice President also announced several administration initiatives
      aimed at enhancing enforcement of wage discrimination both in the private sector and
      within the federal government, including a Memorandum of Understanding between the
      Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor to
      cross-train their staffs to be sensitive to potential violations of the Equal Pay Act, and to
      help the Department of Labor to collect damages under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
      of 1964; a ten-step voluntary self-audit for both private businesses and the federal
      agencies in order to help them monitor their efforts on equal pay; and a "Guide to
      Recruitment and Retention of Women" in the federal government, which is designed to
      assist agency managers hire and retain qualified women.

Q:    Why is this legislation necessary?

A:    More than three decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil
      Rights Act, women and people of color continue to suffer the consequences of unfair pay
      differentials. The average women works a full year, plus three more months, just to earn
      the same pay that men earn in one calendar year. According to the Department of Labor,
      the average women who works full-time eamsjust 74 cents for each dollar that men eam.
       For women of color, the' gap is even wider. On average, black women eam only 63
      cents, and Hispanic women earn only 53 cents for each dollar earned by white men.
      Some wage differences exist due to differing levels of experience, education, and skill.
      However, studies show that even accounting for differences in education, experience, and
      occupation, there is still a significant wage differential. Women account for 46 percent
      of the total labor force. More than half of those graduating with bachelors degrees are
      women, and women earn nearly half of all masters and professional degrees awarded.
      While women hold over 45 percent of all executive and managerial jobs, their wages are
      only approximately 70 percent of the average pay of men in these areas. Source:

Q:  Don't some other studies come up with different numbers?
CEA: can you add an analysis of the studies you examined

Q:    Why isn't the Administration supporting Senator Harkin's bill?

A:    The Administration supports the goals of ensuring equal pay for women and minorities,
      and both bills strive toward the same goals. However, Senator Daschle's bill provides
      for enhanced penalties under the Equal Pay Act by permitting victims of wage
      discrimination to seek compensatory and punitive damages. Senator Daschle's and
      Congresswomen DeLauro's bills seek to strengthen current laws that prohibit wage
      discrimination, and this legislation is a good first step toward combating the wage gap.

Q:    What damages are currently available under the Equal Pay Act?

A:    Senator Daschle's bill would amend the EPA to allow for unlimited compensatory and
      punitive damages. Currently, the EPA only allows for liquidated damages and back-pay
      awards. Liquidated damages typically are awarded in an amount equal to back pay.
      And typical recoveries are double. back-pay awards. An individual can file suit for
      wage discrimination under Title VII as well as the EPA. Title VII allows for
      compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to back pay, as a result of the Civil
      Rights Act of 1991. Under Title VII, however, these damages are capped -- to no
      more than between $50,000 and $300,000, depending on the size of the employer --
      not the severity of the offense (e.g., for firms with between 15 and 100 employees,
      combined damages are capped at $50,000). Victims of racial or ethnic
      discrimination in employment can also sue for wage discrimination under Section
      1981, which allows unlimited damages.

Q:    Won't adding uncapped compensatory and punitive damages to the Equal Pay Act
                                                                      encourage
                                                                      frivolous suits
                                                                      and result in
                                                                      excessive
                                                                       damage
                                                                       awards?

A:    Studies do not support this conclusion. The Daschle bill adds unlimited
      compensatory and punitive damages to the Equal Pay Act. This provides more than
      is currently authorized under Title VII, but achieves parity with racial and ethnic
      discrimination awards under Section 1981. Adding unrestricted damages to equal
      pay cases would not necessarily lead to a huge proliferation of frivolous actions or
      excessive awards. An examination of cases under Section 1981 found that between
      1980 and 1990 plaintiffs won 121 cases -- eleven per year. There were no
      compensatory and punitive damages in 52 of the cases; in 42, damages awarded
      were less than $50,000. Total damages ex~eeded $200,000 in only two cases during

                                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

                    the eleven-year period. Note: this study was limited to reported decisions, and did
                    not include cases settled before trial. Source: Emil -- do you have a source for this?

                    Another study which analyzed over 1000 reported Title VII and Section 1981
                    employment discrimination cases decided between January 1991 and May 1994 shows
                    that victims of intentional employment discrimination have not received "excessive"
                    damages awards under Title VII or under Section 1981. The majority of awards have
                    been moderate in size and, in the rare cases where a judge or jury awarded "excessive"
                    damages, the award was often modified by a subsequent court. Out of the over 1000
                    cases examined, plaintiffs proved intentional discrimination in only 118 cases. Out of
                    the 118 cases, plaintiffs received compensatory or punitive damages in only 28 of these
                    cases. Source: Analysis of Damage Awards under Title VII and Section 1981 (January I, 1991 - May 1.

               Q:   Why is the federal government exempt from punitive damages?

               Q:   Is the Administration's policy on uncapped punitive and compensatory damages
                    consistent with its position in other areas of the law such as tort reform?


               Q:   What is the Administration doing with respect to data collection?

               A:   The endorsed legislation contains a Sense of the Senate that the President should take
                    appropriate steps to increase the amount of information available with respect to wage
                    disparities, while maximizing the utility of the data and protecting individuals' privacy
                    and minimizing burdens on reporting entities. In addition, the Vice President announced
                    an annual report on the pay gap by sex to be produced by the Department of Labor. This
                    easy-to-access report will raise the national prominence of wage disparities and will
                    highlight the issue every year in order to spur Americans to achieve increased gender pay
                    equity.

               Q:   What groups support this legislation?
