              President Clinton's Higher Education Tax Cut Proposal
                                                A Fact Sheet

President Clinton's HOPE Scholarship and 20% Tuition Tax Credit help 12.6 million students and their
families -- seven million more students than under Congressional versions.             While all of the plans
encourage saving and help with student loan payments, only the Administration's proposal provides tax credits
to working families who use their earnings to pay for college beyond the first two years, for part-time study to
improve or acquire job skills, or graduate study. The higher education tax cut plans passed by the House and
Senate are limited in their scope, providing some of the largest benefits to higher-income families who can
afford to save large amounts.

   HOPE Scholarship. A maximum $1,500 credit for the first two years of postsecondary education. Students
    attending on at least a half-time basis would receive a 100% credit for the first $1,000 of tuition and required
    fees and a 50% credit for up to the next $1,000. For example, a student attending a community college with
    tuition costs of$I,400 would receive a $1,200 HOPE Scholarship. Scholarships would be phased out for
    joint filers with income between $80,000 and $100,000, and for single filers with income between $50,000
    and $70,000. After 2002, the HOPE Scholarship increases to a 100% credit for the first $1,500 and a 50%
    credit for the next $1,000 of tuition and required fees.

   20% Tuition Tax Credit. Undergraduates beyond their first two years, graduate students, plus working
    people going to school part-time to improve or acquire job skills, would benefit from a 20% tax credit on the
    first $5,000 of tuition and required fees through the year 2000 and after 2000 a 20% tax credit on the first
    $10,000 of tuition and required fees. The credit would be phased out at the same income levels as HOPE.

   Education and Retirement Savings Accounts. Allows penalty-free IRA withdrawals for undergraduate,
    post-secondary vocational, and graduate education expenses. Additionally, taxpayers eligible for the child
    tax credit are given the opportunity to deposit their child tax credit plus an additional $500, in a Kidsave
    Account for the child's education, first-time home purchase or the taxpayer's retirement. Earnings would
    accumulate tax-free in the Kidsave Account and no taxes would be due upon withdrawal for an approved
    purpose.

   Employer-Provided Education Benefits. Extends permanently Section 127 of the tax code, which allows
    people to exclude $5,250 of employer-provided education benefits from their taxable income. Eligibility
    for graduate education benefits would be reinstated retroactively back to June 30, 1996, with both
    undergraduate and graduate education eligible in the future. Additionally, a 10% employer credit for small
    business training is included. This credit would apply to payments made to third parties to cover expenses
    of education for employees under employer-provided education assistance programs. The credit would be
    available to employers with average annual gross receipts of $1 0 million or less for the prior three years.

   Student Loan Interest Deduction. Allows a deduction for up to $2,500 per year of interest on education
    loans for expenses of students enrolled at an institution of higher education. The deduction would be
    allowed for the first 60 months interest is due on a loan. The deduction would phase out for taxpayers
    making between $45,000 and $65,000 ($65,000 and $85,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly). This
    deduction would be available even if the taxpayer does not itemize deductions.

   Community Service Loan Forgiveness. In most circumstances, a loan that is forgiven is considered
    income and is therefore taxable. To encourage programs that offer loan forgiveness to borrowers who take
    lower-paying, community-service jobs, loan amounts forgiven through programs run by nonprofit
    tax-exempt charitable or educational institutions, and loans forgiven under the Direct Loan Program's
    income-contingent repayment program, would be excluded from income. Currently, the exclusion
    generally covers only certain forgiveness arrangements between students and governrnent entities.

   Repeal Cap on Tax Exempt Bond Issuance by Colleges and Universities. Repeals the $150 million bond
    cap that affects private higher education institutions and certain other charitable institutions. The repeal
    would apply to tax-exempt bonds issued by these institutions to finance new capital expenditures.

                             Methodology of State-by-State Analysis

  Using a nationally-representative sample of postsecondary students and data on Pell Grant recipients, an
  estimate was derived for the proportion of the total national number of recipients of the tax benefit in 1998.
  Using that ratio, the number of recipients for each State was determined. Based on the Joint Tax Committee
. and Treasury revenue estimates of the three plans for 1999, a dollar amount for each State was derived using the
  same ratio as the State/national number of beneficiaries.

                 President Clinton's Higher Education Tax Cuts:
                       Greater Benefits for More Families

While providing the greatest help in the first two years, the Administration's plan has always gone much farther,
granting a substantial tax cut for virtually any investment in postsecondary education or training. Unlike the
Congressional plans, the President's tax credits cover more types and ages ofpostsecondary students, including:

      part-time students (less than half-time) seeking to improve or acquire job skills;

      students beyond their first two years of undergraduate study;

      graduate students.
Although the Administration, House and Senate plans all provide modest assistance for students who borrow or
families who have special education savings accounts, for many situations that families find themselves in, the
House and Senate plans provide little or no help. Consider the following:
