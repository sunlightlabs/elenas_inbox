       PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY HOLD ROUNDTABLE ON EQUAL PAY
             AND URGE PASSAGE OF PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT
                WITH NEW WAGE COLLECTION PROVISION

        At a roundtable discussion with working women and business leaders, the President and
First Lady will discuss the need to ensure that every working American receives equal pay and
equal opportunities. A recent Council of Economic Advisors report found that, although the gap
between women and men's wages has narrowed substantially since the signing of the Equal Pay
Act in 1963, there still exists a significant wage gap that cannot be explained by differences
between male and female workers in labor market experience and in the occupation, industry,
and union status of jobs they hold. The President urged prompt passage of the Paycheck
Fairness Act, which would strengthen wage discrimination laws and provide for additional
training and public education efforts on this important subject. Senator Daschle, the chief
sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, has indicated he will include a new data collection
provision in the bill. That provision will direct the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) to determine what additional data is needed to effectively and efficiently enforce the
federal wage discrimination laws, and to issue a regulation to provide for collecting this data.
Finally, the President urged Congress to provide $14 million in funds for the Equal Pay
Initiative in his Fiscal Year 2000 budget.

Paycheck Fairness Act with New Data Collection Provision

The President again will urge Congress to pass legislation called the "The Paycheck Fairness
Act," introduced. by Senator Daschle and Congresswoman DeLauro, to strengthen laws
prohibiting wage discrimination. The legislation will be reintroduced with a new data collection
provision added. The highlights of this legislation include:

·      New Pay Data Collection Provision. This provision would require the EEOC to
       complete a survey of data currently available for use in enforcing federal wage
       discrimination laws and to identify additional data collections that would enhance
       enforcement of these laws. In addition, the provision would call upon the EEOC to issue
       a regulation, within eighteen months, to provide for the collection of pay information data
       from employers described by the race, sex, and national origin of employees.

·      Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The legislation would provide full
       compensatory and punitive damages as remedies for equal pay violations, in addition to
       the liquidated damages and back pay awards currently available under the EPA. This
       proposal would put gender-based wage discrimination on an equal footing with wage
       discrimination based on race or ethnicity, for which uncapped compensatory and punitive
       damages are already available.

·      Non-retaliation provision. The bill would prohibit employers from punishing employees
       for sharing salary information with their co-workers. Many employers are currently free
       to take action against employees who share wage information. Without the ability to
       learn about wage disparities, it is difficult for employees to evaluate whether there is
                              Hex-Dump Conversion

       wage discrimination.
·      Training, Research, and Pay Equity Award. The bill would provide for increased
       training for EEOC employees to identify and respond to wage discrimination claims;
       research on discrimination in the payment of wages; and the establishment of an
       award to recognize and promote the achievements of employers in eliplinating pay
       disparities.

Roundtable with Working Women and Business Leaders
The President and First Lady will hold a roundtable discussion with working women,
including a university professor, a senior citizen, and a college basketball coach. This
roundtable will provide an opportunity for the President and the First Lady to listen to the
concerns of working women regarding the important issue of equal pay and to urge
Congress to pass the soon-to-be reintroduced "Paycheck Fairness Act."

Equal Pay Initiative
Previously, the President has announced a new $14 million Equal Pay Initiative as part of
his Fiscal Year 2000 budget. The Initiative includes $10 million for the EEOC to increase
compliance with equal pay laws by providing training to EEOC employees to identify and
respond to wage discrimination, increasing technical assistance to businesses on how to
meet legal requirements, and launching an equal pay public service announcement
campaign to inform employers and employees alike of their rights and responsibilities.
The Initiative also includes $4 million for the Department of Labor, primarily for a
program to assist contractors in recruiting and retaining qualified women in
non-traditional occupations.

                          Questions And Answers on Equal Pay
                                     April 7, 1999

Q:   What did the President announce today?

A:   The President announced a new provision to collect pay data that will be added to the
     Paycheck Fairness Act, sponsored by Senator Daschle and Congresswoman DeLauro, that
     will direct the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to determine what
     additional data is needed to effectively and efficiently enforce the federal wage
     discrimination laws, and to issue a regulation to provide for collecting this data. The
     President and First Lady also held a roundtable discussion with working women to
     highlight the need to ensure that every working American receives equal pay and equal
     opportunities. The President urged prompt passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which
     would strengthen wage discrimination laws; provide for additional training and public
     education efforts on this important subject; and ensure that pay data is collected. Finally,
     the President urged Congress to provide $14 million in funds for the Equal Pay
     Initiative in his Fiscal Year 2000 budget.

Q:   What will the new provision on data collection do?

A:   This provision would require the EEOC to complete a survey of data currently available
     for use in enforcing federal wage discrimination laws and to identify additional data
     collections that would enhance enforcement of these laws. In addition, the provision
     would call upon the EEOC to issue a regulation, within eighteen months, to provide for
     the collection of pay information data from employers described by the race, sex, and
     national origin of employees.

Q:   Why is collection of data related to wages needed?

A:   Currently, the federal government does not collect wage data that can be used to monitor
     and enforce employer compliance with laws that prohibit wage discrimination, with the
     exception of higher education. This data collection provision will provide an important
     source of data that will help to end the gender pay gap.

Q:   How large is the wage gap?

A:   According to the Department of the Labor, in 1998, the average woman who worked
     full-time earned about 75 cents for each dollar earned by the average man. For women
     of color, the gap was even wider. Based on weekly wages in 1998, the median black
     woman who worked full-time earned only 65 cents, and median Hispanic woman earned
     only 55 cents for each dollar earned by the median white man. Some wage differences
     exist due to differing levels of experience, education, and skill. However, a recent
     Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) study shows that even accounting for differences


                                               1
                          Hex-Dump Conversion

     in education, experience, and occupation, there is still a significant wage differential
     between women and men.

Q:   What about recent reports that there is no longer a wage gap?

A:   While these studies are correct that women's wages and educational attainment
     have been rising in recent years, there is still a sizeable gender wage gap that cannot
     be explained by observable characteristics. According to the Council of Economic
     Advisors, in 1997, the gender pay ratio was about 75 percent, leaving a gap between
     men's and women's wages of approximately 25 percent. The most recent detailed
     longitudinal study found that in the late 1980s about one-third of the gender pay gap was
     explained by differences in the full-time experience that women bring to the labor market
     and about 28 percent was due to differences in industry, occupation, and union status
     among men and women. Accounting for these difference raised the female/male pay
     ratio in the late 1980s from about 72 percent to about 88 percent, leaving around 12
     percent as an "unexplained" difference. Applied to 1998 data, that leaves a gap of
     about 10% still unexplained. The 98 percent figure cited by these other studies is
     based on data narrowly limited to women and men aged 27 to 33 who have never
     had children.

     A recently released report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), "A
     Study on the Status of Women Faculty in Science at MIT" also refutes the notion
     that there is no longer gender discrimination or a wage gap. The report documents
     a pattern in the M.LT. School of Science of sometimes subtle -- but substantive and
     demoralizing -- gender discrimination. Examination of data revealed that many
     tenured women faculty feel marginalized and that this marginalization is often
     accompanied by differences in salary, space, awards, resources, and response to
     outside offers between men and women faculty with women receiving less despite
     professional accomplishments equal to those of their male colleagues. The M.I.T.
     report also found that the percentage of the School of Science faculty who are
     women,8 percent, remained virtually unchanged for at least 10 and probably 20
     years. In another recent report, the American Association of University Professors
     found that although women grew from 23 percent in 1975 to 34 percent of faculty
     nationwide currently, the gap between salaries of male and female professors
     actually widened in that period. The federal government currently collects some
     wage data at post-secondary institutions, and the EEOC will look at this data in the
     course of its survey of data for use in the enforcement of federal laws prohibiting
     pay discri~ination.

Q:   What does the Paycheck Fairness Act do?

A:   The legislation, sponsored by Senator Daschle, seeks to improve the enforcement of wage
     discrimination laws and to strengthen the remedy provisions in the Equal Pay Act by
     permitting victims of wage discrimination to seek compensatory and punitive damages.

                               Hex-Dump Conversion

      Currently, women who are the victims of wage discrimination receive only backpay and
      liquidated damages, which may not fully compensate them for their loss. This change
      will mean that the penalties for sex-based wage discrimination will be the same as those
      for race-based wage discrimination. In addition, the legislation contains a non-retaliation
      provision that prohibits employers from penalizing employees for sharing information
      about their salaries with co-workers. The bill also provides for training for EEOC
      employees on matters involving the discrimination of wages, research on discrimination
      in the payment of wages, and the establishment of an award to recognize and
      promote the achievements of employers that have made strides to eliminate pay
      disparities. Finally, the new data collection provision will be added to the bill so
      that the EEOC will issue a regulation to provide for collecting pay information to
      enhance enforcement of the federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination.

Q:    What's wrong with the current scheme for collecting damages under the Equal Pay
      Act?

A:    Currently, the Equal Pay Act allows only for liquidated damages and backpay awards.
      Liquidated damages usually are awarded in an amount equal to backpay. Such awards
      may not fully compensate a woman for real losses, such as damages for pain and      .
      suffering. In addition, employees bringing a claim under the Equal Pay Act cannot
      receive punitive damages for wage discrimination, no matter how intentional and
      egregious the employer's conduct. The legislation the Administration is endorsing will
      ensure that women are fully compensated and will be able to receive punitive damages if
      an employer's conduct is particularly egregious.

Q:    Why isn't the Administration supporting comparable worth?

A:    The Daschle-DeLauro bill is a significant step forward in solving the problem of unequal
      pay. The Administration believes there is no excuse for not taking these obvious steps
      towards providing better training and fuller remedies to help ensure women receive equal
      pay, while building a consensus on other ways to make sure every person receives the pay
      they deserve. The Administration is focusing on legislation that can be passed during this
      congressional session.


Questions on the Federal Work Force

Q:    What are some of the specific accomplishments of the Clinton Administration with
      respect to women appointees?

A:    Here are some specific accomplishments:


·Appointed More Women than Any Qther President --40 percent of Administration


                                                3

appointees are women.
      ·Women Hold 29 Percent of the Top Positions --29 percent of the positions requiring
      Senate confirmation (PAS) are held by women. Additionally,
      <       35 percent of Presidential appointments, including boards and commissions, are
              held by women.
                40 percent of non-career Senior Executive Service positions are held by women.
               56 percent of Schedule C positions are held by women.
       Appointed the First Women Ever to Serve as Attorney General, Janet Reno, and
       Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. Including the Attorney General and Secretary
       of State, women make up 32 percent of the Clinton Cabinet: Alexis Herman, Secretary
       of Labor; Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services; Carol Browner,
       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Janet Yellen, Chair of the
       Council of Economic Advisors; and Charlene Barshefsky, United States Trade
       Representative all serve in the President's Cabinet.
       ·30 Percent of All of the President's Judicial Nominees Are Women.
       'Nominated the Second Woman to Serve on the Supreme Court. During his first
       year in office, President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the United States
       Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg is only the second woman to serve on the nation's
       highest court.

Q:     What is the representation of women in the federal work force?

A:     Women represented 42.9 percent of the Federal permanent workforce in 1998 compared
       to 46.3 percent of the Civilian Labor Force, a difference of a -3.4 percentage points.

Q:     What is the average salary of female political employees versus tbat of male
       appointees? How does that average compare to comparable figures in the previous
       Administration?

A:     In 1992, under President Bush, women made up 40 percent of the political ranks, and the
       average female political appointee's salary was 75 percent of the average male
       appointee's salary. In 1998, in the Clinton Administration, the percentage of women
       appointees increased to 44 percent, and the average woman's salary increased to 86
       percent of the average man's.
