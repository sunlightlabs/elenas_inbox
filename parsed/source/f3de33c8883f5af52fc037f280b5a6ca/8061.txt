TEXT:
Attached is the latest draft of the poverty memo. The main change is that
the first three pages have been substantially re-cast in an effort to
better structure the main issues for the Principals.   (We've also moved
the placement of Tables 1 and 2.)   This attachment does not include the
Guideline appendix which. will be sent under separate cover.  However, you
may want to know that the new appendix does include a range of estimates
on potential budgetary impact of using the new poverty measures.

We would like to get this background memo to the Principals as soon as
possible. Therefore, please send Ceci your comments by 3pm tomorrow; the
full memo will be sent to the Principals at 5pm.

DRAFT BACKGROUND MEMORANDUM FOR EOP PRINCIPAL'S MEETING

FROM:         Income and Poverty Measurement Working Group

Subject:      Meeting on Income and Poverty Measures

This cover memo outlines the main issues related to revising our income and poverty measures to
be discussed at the Principals meeting, and the attached background paper explains the more
technical issues. The background paper was prepared by a policy working group consisting of
CEA, DPC, NEC, and OMB. (Among the agencies, only the Deputy Assistant SecretfU)' for
Human Services Policy at HHS participated because of her expertise on poverty measurement.)

Action Forcing Event and Purpose of the Meeting

In early 1999, the Census Bureau will publish alternative measures of poverty based on the
proposals contained in the 1995 National Research Council (NRC) report, Measuring Poverty: A
New Approach. Census has asked for advice from the EOP on their proposed alternative
measures (because OMB, through OIRA's Statistical Policy Office, is the statutory arbiter ofthe
"official" poverty measurement methodology). It is important to emphasize that we are only
being asked to advise the Bureau of the Census; what it actually publishes is its decision.

There are four questions to be discussed at the meeting: 1) At what pace should the
Administration proceed toward the adoption of a new official measure of poverty? 2) Should
the Administration initially propose a preferred option or a range of alternatives? 3) Should the
new measure be benchmarked to the most current poverty rate? 4) Ifhighlighting a preferred
option is selected, what are the components of that preferred option? . In considering these
questions, it is critical that the Principals note that, at this time, we do not have definitive
analyses of the budgetary and programmatic impacts of NRC-based alternative measures of
poverty. We are unlikely to have such analyses before the Census publishes its report.

Background

The current official poverty measure dates back to the 1960s. And, although this measure has
been an important contributor to public debate and policymaking, the NRC report reflects a broad
consensus that the measure is out-of-date and in need of revision.

Poverty measurement involves two concepts: (1) a definition of family resources, and (2) a
"threshold" against which resources are compared to determine if a family is poor. Changes in
these two concepts will have a direct impact on statistics used by the public for informational and
analytical purposes. Changes will likely have an effect on both Federal program budgets and
participant eligibility as well.
                                                                            Hex-pymp Conversion

                                                                            CLOSE HOLD. Page 2

As discussed in the technical background paper, the NRC's recommended new poverty measure
has two important consequences for the poverty rate. First, it would increase the poverty rates of
all groups. For example, as shown in Table 1, in 1996 the poverty level was 13.7% using the
current measure; it would increase to 18% using the new measure .

. Second, it would substantially alter the demographic composition of the poor as set out in Table
  2. For example, the NRC measure nearly doubles the poverty rate among the elderly (from
  10.8% to 20.4%), raising the rate to nearly that of children. Other groups with relatively large
  increases are Whites and Hispanics, and married couples.

It is important to keep in mind that the NRC panel cautioned that setting the level below which a
family is considered poor is more of an art than a science. They therefore suggested a range of
alternatives and left it to policymakers to determine the most appropriate levels.

Issues for Consideration

1. At What Pace Should the Administration Proceed Toward the Adoption of a New Official
Measure of Poverty?

The most important issue to be decided is whether the Administration should attempt to adopt a
new official measure of poverty before the end of the second term. The advantage of acting
during this Administration is that the second term of an Administration with a strong economy is
an opportune time to make such a change. Also, the NAS made its recommendation three years
ago and some might question our delay in implementation. On the other hand, by proceeding
more cautiously, we would allow the community of users of poverty statistics to develop a better
understanding of the pros and cons, both analytical and programmatic, of the various alternative
measures. By establishing a more open process, we may also decrease the chance of a political
backlash and of Congressional intervention. In addition, it will take at least another 4 years to
develop fully the data needed to implement the NRC recommendations. Finally, selecting a
preferred alternative measure and analyzing its programmatic and budgetary impacts is likely to
be an iterative process that may take some time.

2. Should the Administration Initially Propose a Preferred Option or a Range of Alternatives?

Census' current plan is to publish a small number of alternatives. These would reflect the NAS
recommendation and analytically interesting variations. (There will be extensive appendices in
this report that will report a wide variety of different poverty definitions, to help demonstrate the
statistical and analytical properties of the poverty measure recommended by the NRC.)

We need to determine whether we will recommend that the Census Bureau select or highlight a
single alternative poverty measure, or present several equally in its forthcoming report. The
advantages of highlighting a single alternative measure is that it may be less confusing than
publishing multiple alternatives, and if we are correct in our choice, it may be easier for it to be
                                                                         Hex-Dump Com'~rsion
                                                                          CLOSE HOLD. Page 3

selected as the official poverty measure. In contrast, publishing a range of alternatives has many
of the same advantages of proceeding cautiously in the adoption of a new official measure of
poverty; that is, it would allow us more time to understand fully the analytical, programmatic,
and budgetary implications of the different alternative measures, preserve the Administration's
options to consider this issue further, and may be less likely to raise the ire of Congress.

3. If Highlighting a Preferred Option is Selected, Should the New Measure Be Benchmarked to
the Most Current Poverty Rate? (This is issue number 1 in the technical background paper.)

If we select a single measure, we will need to decide whether to recommend that Census
benchmark the new poverty measure to the old poverty rate in the current year (so that the
number of people classified as poor would remain the same, although the distribution would
change) or publish an NRC-like measure, which would result in a higher poverty rate (e.g., 18%
rather than 13.7% in 1996). Some argue that benchmarking to the current poverty rate would
diminish criticisms that the change is motivated by an effort to increase the estimated number of
people living in poverty, and would also focus attention on the distribution of who is poor, rather
than on how many people are poor. Others argue that since benchmarking to the current poverty
rate does not follow the NRC recommendation (which would result in a higher poverty rate), it
will be viewed as an effort to reduce artificially the estimated size of the poor population. Also,
it could be argued that benchmarking alters the composition ofthe poor. For example, the Black
poverty rate falls with benchmarking but rises with the NRC measure.

4. If Highlighting a Preferred Option is Selected, What are the Components of that Preferred
Option? .

Issues relating to the choice of components are discussed in the technical background paper.
They include: how the poverty rate should be updated over time; whether the poverty thresholds
should be adjusted for geographic variation in the cost-of-living; and how to account for medical
care expenditures. Of these, how to adjust for medical expenditures is the most controversial.
At this time, the Census Bureau is prepared to account for differences in medical out~of-pocket
(MOOP) expenditures among households in the way recommended by the NRC, namely,
subtracting them from income before a family'S poverty status is calculated. However, there is
also interest in having medical expenditures added to the poverty thresholds. (Which of these
methodologies should be used is a technical choice best left to Census.)

       TECHNICAL BACKGROUND ON INCOME AND POVERTY MEASURES


The Current Poverty Measure

The methodology by which current poverty thresholds are determined was developed in the early
1960s by Mollie Orshansky, a staff economist at the Social Security Administration. She
developed a set of poverty thresholds that vary with the number of adults, the number of children,
and the age of the family head. These thresholds represent the cost of a minimum diet
multiplied by 3 to allow for nonfood expenditures. The multiplier of 3 was chosen because the
average family in 1955 spent one-third of its after-tax income on food. Since the late 1960s, the
thresholds have been updated annually with the CPI to adjust for price inflation. Thus, the
definition of poverty has remained virtually unchanged for 35 years, despite substantial changes
in family behavior and government policy.

The NRC panel identified several weaknesses in the current poverty measure:

      The current poverty measure takes no account of changes in taxes (e.g., the expansion of
       the EITC) or in-kind benefits (e.g., Food Stamps).

      The current measure does not distinguish between the needs of working and nonworking
       families. In particular, it does not reflect the cost of child care and other work expenses
       for working low-income families.

      The current poverty measure takes no explicit account of medical care costs, which vary
       significantly across families and have increased substantially since the current poverty
       measure was developed.

The NRC Recommendations

In order to understand the NRC panel's recommended revisions, one must understand the basics
of determining poverty. A family is considered poor when its resources fall below a
predetermined poverty line or threshold. Therefore, one must develop a methodology for
estimating family resources and for defining the threshold resource level below which a family is
considered poor.

1.     Defining Family Resources

Under the current poverty calculation, the definition of family resources is cash income. The
NRC recommendations would estimate family resources as:

Family resources             Cash income + Near-money in-kind benefits - Taxes - Child care
                             costs - Work expenses - Child support payments - Out of pocket
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                          CLOSE HOLD. Page 7

                              medical care expenditures (including health insurance premiums)

The rationale for subtracting taxes, work, and medical expenses from family resources is that
these expenditures are typically not discretionary and reduce the family income available to
achieve a basic quality of life.

There is near consensus among researchers that adjusting for near-money in-kind benefits
(primarily Food Stamps and housing subsidies) and taxes would be an improvement in how
poverty is measured. There is slightly less agreement on whether child care costs, work
expen~es, and child support payments should also be deducted because an unknown proportion
of these expenses is likely discretionary. (The NRC proposes to cap the amount of child care
and work expenses that can be subtracted to deal with this problem.) As discussed below, the
adjustment for out-of-pocket medical care expenditures is more controversial.

2.     Defining a Poverty Threshold

A threshold must be determined against which to compare a family's resources. The NRC panel
 recommends basing the threshold on expenditures on "necessities" (food, shelter, and clothing)
plus a little more. Specifically, the NRC panel recommends selecting the 30th to 35th percentile
in the distribution of annual expenditures on food, shelter, and clothing among families of four
(two adults and two children), and then mUltiplying this expenditure level by between 1.15 and
1.25. Thresholds for other family sizes and types would be determined by an equivalency scale
calculation.

The NRC recommends adjusting these thresholds to take into account geographic variation in
cost of living, based on differences in housing costs by region and by city-size. It also
recommends adjusting the thresholds over time by recalculating them from expenditure data on
an annual basis.


                                    TECHNICAL ISSUES

1. Determining the level of the poverty threshold.

The NRC panel acknowledges that the actual level at which the poverty threshold is set (and
hence the final poverty rate) is inherently arbitrary and cannot be determined on the basis of
purely statistical judgements. There are two primary options:

A. The NRC alternative. As described above, the NRC panel recommends establishing a
threshold based on the 30th-35th percentile in the distribution of annual expenditures for a family
offour, with a small multiplier to account for additional small personal expenditures. As shown
in Tables 1 and 2, column 3, this would raise the 1996 poverty rate from 13.7% to 18%, and
increase poverty among all subgroups. In addition, (as described further in Option B) this
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                CLOSE HOLD. Page 8

    change will alter the composition of poverty by changing the poverty rate among subgroups.

    B. Benchmarking. The NRC panel also considered poverty estimates that benchmark the
    alternative poverty rate to equal the old poverty rate in a given year. The Census Bureau has
    done a number of such benchmarked calculations for 1996, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, column
    2. (The report issued early next year could benchmark to 1997.) Benchmarking would assure
    that the aggregate poverty rate is identical for the official and the alternative measure in the'
    benchmark year. But the distribution of poverty among subgroups within each measure would
    differ (see Table 2). In general, working families and families with large out-of-pocket medical
    expenses become poorer and nonworking families with substantial in-kind benefits become less
I   poor. This has geographic as well as subgroup poverty rate implications. Similarly, both
    historical and future trends would differ. For instance, the alternative measure is identical in
    1996 but higher in 1991. (The faster fall using the alternative measure is largely due to the
    expansion in the EITC.)

    Pros of using the NRC measure:
          Incorporates the recommendations of the NRC panel, based on their professional
          judgement from the best available evidence.

          Generates dollar threshold levels that are quite similar to the current dollar thresholds
           (although the resources to which the thresholds would be compared are.quite different).

    Cons of using the NRC Measure:
         Results in a higher poverty rate (although the trends over time are similar.)


    Pros of Benchmarking:
          May provide an easier transition to the new methodology because there will not be a
           change in the overall level of poverty. Critics, of course, will still charge that this level
           is arbitrary.

          Focuses the arguments on the relative distribution of who is poor rather than how many
           people are poor.

    Cons ofBenchmarking:
         Violates the NRC recommendation that the threshold should be based on the 30th-35th
          percentile in the expenditure distribution. In order to benchmark, the threshold falls to
          (about) the 25th percentile of expenditures on food, shelter, and clothing.


    2. Updating the thresholds over time

    Currently the poverty threshold is updated annually using the CPI_U. This, however, does not
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion .


                                                                         CLOSE HOLD. Page 9

allow for adjustments that reflect changes in underlying consumption patterns that might affect
the revised thresholds. For instance, food prices have decreased relative to other goods over
time, while housing prices have increased. There are two options:

(A) Recalculate the thresholds annually as a share of consumption on food, shelter, and clothing.
(This is recommended by the NRC panel.)

(B) Update the thresholds on a year-to-year basis using a price index (preferably one based only
on food, shelter and clothing). Implement a regular process (every 5-10 years) of reviewing the
poverty measure and recalculating the thresholds.

Pros ofRe-calculating the Thresholds:
      Regular recalculation will allow the poverty thresholds to reflect more accurately changes
       in consumption patterns and standards ofliving.
                                            ,
      Without an expectation that the thresholds will be re-calculated regularly, it may be hard
       to update them at all.

Cons ofRe-calculating the Thresholds:
     Under certain data circumstances, recalculation could move the threshold a large amount
      or in an unexpected direction. This might raise substantive and political concerns.


Pros of Updating Using the CPI:
      Using the NRC methodology, the poverty thresholds are somewhat relative (i.e., they are
       affected by changes in the distribution of household expenditures.) As a result, they are
       a moving target and do not provide an absolute standard of need. A CPI adjustment
       would make it easier to compare poverty from year-to-year against a constant standard.

      Because consumption patterns and standards of living change slowly, it may be better to
       take them into account periodically rather than annually.

      An update with a CPI for necessities only (food, clothing, and shelter) may capture most
       of the relevant changes and would make it easier in the short run to understand the
       updating procedure.

      The data may not be good enough for an annual re-calculation of the thresholds .

. Cons of Updating Using the CPI:
       Does not follow the NRC recommendations.

      Needs to be supplemented by a periodic updating and recalculation process that could
       prove difficult to implement.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                         CLOSE HOLD. Page lO


NOTE: The EOP Policy Working Group recommends Option (8).


3. Should thresholds be adjusted for geographic variation.

The NRC panel recommended adjusting the poverty thresholds for cost-of-living differences
across regions and by city size. Following the NRC recommendation, the Census Bureau
proposes to make such adjustments based on housing cost differences (which have much greater
regional/city size variation than food or clothing.)

Pros ofAdjusting for Geographic Variation in Cost ofLiving:
      Most statisticians and economists agree that such adjustments should be made if data are
       available.

        The Administrative poverty guidelines that currently exist are already adjusted for Alaska
         and Hawaii.

Cons ofAdjusting for Geographic Variation in Cost ofLiving:
     There is no one "right" way to make such adjustments and the issue could be highly
      politicized.

        The data available to make such adjustments are limited and may not be entirely reliable.

        Implementing such an adjustment in the poverty line threshold could lead to pressure to
         provide regional cost adjustments in a wide variety of other government programs, from
         Social Security benefits to tax payments.


NOTE: The EOP Policy Working Group recommends against geographic price adjustments.


    4. How to account for medical care expenditures.

Since the mid-l970s, analysts have been concerned that the official poverty rate overstates the
extent of poverty among beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance. At
the same time, the official poverty rate may understate the extent of poverty among populations
with large medical expenditures. Most analysts agree that, in principle, medical care "needs"
should be incorporated into the calculations of the threshold and family resources (i.e., families
with higher medIcal needs should have higher thresholds; those with more generous medical
benefits should be considered to have more resources; and those who must spend more to
achieve "good health" should have those expenses subtracted from their resources). However
we cannot observe a family's medical need. In addition, it is not clear that one can simply
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                                               CLOSE HOLD. Page 11

     impute the cash value of insurance benefits and add this to income; the "extra" benefits received
     from insurance to cover expensive medical services do not provide income that can be used for
     any other purpose.

     To understand the difficulties, consider including medical benefits into the income calculations.
     Adding medical benefits to income, without also adjusting the poverty threshold, has the perverse
     effect of making sicker individuals appear better off. Other proposals to adjust the poverty
     threshold (without also adjusting resources) run into similar problems.

     In the end, the NRC panel recommended subtracting all medical out-of-pocket (MOOP)
     expenses (including health insurance premiums) from income, without trying to value health
     insurance as a part of income or medical need as a part of the thresholds. Hence, family
     resources are measured net ofMOOP. Those individuals with good insurance will have few
     out- of-pocket medical expenses; those without insurance who face health problems will have
     lower measured incomes as they pay more for medical care.

     This adjustment accounts for the larger poverty rates using the NRC methodology. For example,
     in 1996 the poverty rate was 13.7% using the current methodology; it would have been 18%
     using the NRC methodology, but only 13.2% using the NRC methodology without the medical
     expenses adjustment. This adjustment nearly doubles the poverty rate for the elderly, raising it
     almost to the rate for children. This adjustment is one of the most controversial of the NRC
     recommendations.

     There is general agreement that ignoring medical care and medical expenses entirely is not a
     good idea, particularly given the rapid increase in medical costs in the past 30 years, the extent of
     uninsurance among the low-income population, and this Administration's concern with it. In
     addition, if we do not adjust for medical care (in some way) now, it may be much harder to do so
     in a few years when we will have better data (because the change will be so dramatic it will be
     viewed as another big methodology change).

     There are three approaches to incorporating medical care and expenses:

     (A) Follow the NRC recommendation and subtract MOOP from family resources. This makes
     families with unreimbursed medical expenses less well-off than other families.

     (B) MOOP could be added to the thresholds rather than subtracted from resources. (The choice
     between options (A) and (B) is a technical decision that Census should address.)

     (C) Try to impute the value of health insurance to resources, so those with insurance have higher
     resources. Health insurance should then also be imputed into the thresholds.       .

     Pros ofAdjustingfor MOOP (either options (A) or (B}):
           While not perfect, under the NRC recommended adjustment families with higher
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversicn

                                                                            CLOSE HOLD. Page 12

           unreimbursed medical expenditures will be "poorer." The NRC recommended
           adjustment would also be sensitive to changes in health care financing that would
           decrease MOOP and thereby increase disposable income and reduce poverty.

    Cons ofAdjustingfor MOOP (either options (A) or (B)):
         The data that are currently available are out-of-date (but we should have updated
          information available in a more timely fashion within another year.)

          The NRC recommended approach relies on the controversial assumption that all medical
           care expenditures are nondiscretionary. (This concern could be mitigated to some extent
           by imposing a cap on the amount of medical expenses.)


    Pros ofImputing the Value ofHealth Insurance into Resources and Thresholds:
          Provides a more complete accounting of all medical resources available to a family.

    Cons ofImputing the Value ofHealth Insurance into Resources and Thresholds:
         There is no accepted "correct" way to do this. The data here are probably more
          unreliable thaI) the data needed to impute the value of MOOP to families.

          Many analysts agree with the NRC panel that the value of health insurance is quite
           different from (say) the value offood stamps, which are far more fungible. Mixing in
           health insurance coverage with economic need causes interpretational and conceptual
         . problems to a measure of economic need.

          To date, Census has been following the NRC recommendation. Ifwe asked them to
           switch to this approach, it might require substantial additional work and seriously delay
           their report.

    NOTE: The EOP Policy Working Group recommends that Census incomorate medical care in
    some way and recognizes that the Census Bureau of prepared for option (A). However, the
    grOUP strongly recommends that Census thoroughly investigate the impact of option (B), and
    continue work on other approaches to incomorating medical care and expenditures, such as by
    valuing medical health insurance (option (C).
