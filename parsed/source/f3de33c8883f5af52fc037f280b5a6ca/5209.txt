Policy Announcements to be Made at the Conference

       We recommend that you make the following policy announcements, which focus on the
expansion of the federal hate crimes legislation, the improvement oflaw enforcement
mechanisms to fight hate crimes, and the dissemination of educational materials on this issue

        Legislation. You can announce the Administration's support for legislation to expand
the principal federal hate crimes statute. The law currently prohibits hate crimes only on the
basis of race, color, religion, or national origin. Your proposed amendment would extend the law
to prohibit hate crimes based on gender, sexual orientation, and disability. (To satisfy
constitutional concerns, the law would require proof of interstate commerce in this new class of
cases.)    Senator Kennedy and Senator Spector are expected to introduce this legislation shortly
after the Conference.

       There is some concern that extension of the statute to gender-motivated hate
                                                                                  crimes--which

       Enforcement. We also recommend that you announce a package oflaw enforcement
proposals, including:

     Creation of a Network of Local Hate Crime Working Groups. Under this proposal, each

                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                  g
       U.S. Attorney would either establish a local hate crime working group in his or her
       district, or if such a body already exists, actively participate in the group. These working
       groups--essentially federal-state-Iocal partnerships-- would include representation from
       the U.S. Attorney's office, the FBI, state and local law enforcement, state and local
       prosecutors' offices, and advocacy groups. In addition to addressing law enforcement
       strategies, the groups would seek to educate the public about hate crimes. A National
       Hate Crimes Working Group, located at the Main Justice, would coordinate the work of
       all the working groups across the country. As part of this coordinating function, the
       National Hate Crimes Working Group would distribute, on an ongoing basis, information
       on promising practices.

      Additional FBI Agents for Hate Crimes Enforcement. This proposal involves assigning
       over 30 additional FBI agents and prosecutors to the task of hate crimes enforcement.
       OMB and Justice are currently discussing whether Justice needs additional monetary
       resources to effect this policy. (DOJ has asked for about $13 million in FY99). We plan
       to try to avoid this budgetary issue by simply saying that the amount of additional .
       resources required, if any, will be settled in the normal budget process.

      Hate Crimes Training for Law Enforcement. DOJ has developed a model law
       enforcement training curriculum on hate crimes that can be incorporated into programs at
       local and state law enforcement training centers. This curriculum includes three course
       segments -- one for law enforcement officers, one for investigators, and one for others in
       the law enforcement field. You can direct DOJ to make this curriculum available for use
       across the country in 30 days.

      Make 'em Pay Initiative. HUD has developed an initiative to assist victims of hate
       crimes and discrimination in housing to seek monetary damages from the perpetrators .
     . HUD has created a unit that will bring civil suits on behalf of residents of public and
       private housing who have suffered hate crimes and other discrimination. This initiative
       will require no new money.

      Improved Reporting of Hate Crimes Statistics. The National Crime Victimization
       Survey is an annual survey conducted by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice
       Statistics to measure levels of crime through a national sampling of victims of crime. At
       present, it does not include questions about hate crime. Beginning in 1998, the
       Department of Justice will include questions related to hate crime in NCVS. The survey
       will inquire whether the victim believes the incident was bias-motivated and why. (The
       Government currently does attempt to gather hate crimes statistics, but by a notably less
       effective mechanism.) Expanded questioning regarding hate crimes will also be a part of
       a pilot project to take place next Spring to improve the NCVS.

      Education. You can also announce two new educational initiatives. First, the
Departments of Justice and Education have proposed a manual for educators on preventing youth


                                                6
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

hate crime that encourages schools to confront hate-motivated behavior among students;
promotes development of comprehensive, programmatic responses to prejudice and violence; and
makes educators aware of resources that can be used for this purpose. The Departments intend
to send this resource guide to every school in the country. Second, the Department of Justice
has created a new website, "Hateful Acts Hurt Kids," addressing prejudice, discrimination, and
related issues in an interactive, graphic format designed for children in kindergarten through fifth
grade, as well as their parents and teachers. This site will be available for viewing at the
Conference.
