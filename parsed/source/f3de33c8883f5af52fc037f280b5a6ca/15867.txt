      Governor Winter was born in Mississippi and received B.A. and LL.B degrees
       from the University of Mississippi in 1943 and 1949, respectively.

      Governor Winter served as a State Representative to the Mississippi Legislature
       from 1948 to 1964, State Tax Collector 1956 to 1964, State Treasurer from 1964
       to 1968, and Lieutenant Goverhor of Mississippi from 1972 to 1976. He was
       Governor of Mississippi from 1980 to 1984. From 1968 through 1979, and from

June 12, 1997 12:30am                       4
       the Foundation for the Mid South, the Kettering Foundation and the National

       Eudora Welty Professor of Southern Studies at Millsaps College.

      Governor Winter stood out among white politicians in Mississippi in the 1960s by
       calling for civil rights and better relations between the races. As governor, he
       won wide praise for his efforts to bring African-Americans into state government,
       appointing a number to key posts for the first time. On the third try, he      '
       succeeded in convincing the state legislature to approve an education reform
       package perceived as largely benefitting African-Americans and poorer white
       Mississippians. In his unsuccessful campaign for the Senate in 1984, Governor
       Winter summed up his term by saying that "the people of Mississippi need not
       just to 'live better' but to 'live together better'."

       a very close election for governor. In 1985 Mr. Kean was re-elected by
       approximately 69 of the vote and was quickly considered one of the rising stars
       of the Republican Party.

      As Governor, Mr. Kean served with Governor Clinton on seve'ral committees of
       the National Governor's Association and gained a reputation for being a staunch

           Program's Advisory Board.




          In addition, Kean served as a member of the Carnegie Council on Adolescent
           Development and Education, the bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax
           Reform, and on an advisory committee on regulatory reform for the Department
           of Housing and Urban Development in 1990.

          In 1988, he gave the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in
           Houston, chaired Bush's New Jersey presidential campaign, and published The
           Politics of Inclusion, a biography that encourages Republicans to embrace
           non-divisive issues and to reach out to minority communities. In addition, Kean
           asserts in his book that government should create and promote opportunity, but
           should not be relied upon to avoid a loss of independence or initiative.
           Following the election Bush asked Kean to chair his Thousand Points of Light
           effort.

          New Jersey term limit restrictions prevented Kean from running for re-election in
           1990 and he accepted the position of President of Drew University.    In 1995,
           Governor Whitman appointed him to serve as the Chairman of an advisory
           committee on school vouchers.
