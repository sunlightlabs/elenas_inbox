           Section 3(a) provides that a petition for certification of eligibility to apply for assistance is

    to be filed by a group of workers, or by their union or other representatives, such as the

    workers' firm, State agencies, and one-stop career centers, with the Governor of the State in

    which the workers' firm is located. The Governor is to immediately transmit the petition to the

    Secretary of Labor; ensure that rapid response assistance and basic readjustment services

    authorized under other Federal laws are made available to workers covered by the petition; and

    assist the Secretary in reviewing the petition by verifying information and providing such other

    assistance as the Secretary may request. The Secretary is to publish a notice in the Federal

    Register upon receipt of an petition that an investigation has been initiated. This provision is a

    hybrid of the current petition procedures under the two programs. Currently under T AA the

    petition is filed with the Secretary rather than the State and there is no requirement that the State

    provide appropriate rapid response services. Rapid response assistance and basic readjustment

    services provide critical information and services that can often facilitate coordinated planning

    and more rapid reemployment for affected workers. Therefore, it is essential that this assistance

    be included in the consolidated program. Currently, under NAFTA-T AA the petition is filed

    with the Governor, who has ten days to make a preliminary determination of eligibility, and then

    transmits the petition to the Secretary for a final determination. Rapid response assistance is

    required upon an affirmative finding. The consolidated provision relieves the burden on the


                                                      16

States of making a preliminary determination and avoids unnecessary delay in the provision of

rapid response assistance. Under the consolidated provision, the State is also to provide such

assistance in reviewing the petition as the Secretary may request, which should assist in

expediting the review process.

       Section 3(b) accelerates the time period in which the Secretary is to complete a review of

the petitions from the current 60 days after a petition is filed under TAA to 40 days after a

petition is filed under the consolidated program.

       Section 4 adds as a basis for eligibility under the consolidated T AA program job loss due

to the shift in production by the workers' firm to another country. Currently, T AA eligibility is

limited to workers who are adversely affected by imports. NAFTA-T AA eligibility is based on

workers already affected by imports from Mexico and Canada or a shift in production to either of

those two countries. The consolidated T AA program will base eligibility on workers adversely

affected by either imports from or shifts in production to any foreign country.

       Specifically, the amended section 222(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 would provide that a

group of workers filing a petition will be eligible for assistance if the Secretary determines that a

significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm or subdivision have become

separated, or are threatened with separation, and either: (1) the sales or production of the firm

have decreased absolutely, imports of articles like or directly competitive with the articles

produced by the firm or subdivision have increased, and the increase in imports contributed

importantly to the workers' separation and to the decline in sales or production by the workers'

firm, or (2) there has been a shift in production by the workers' firm or subdivision to a foreign

country of articles like or directly competitive with the articles produced by the firm or


                                                 17
                             Hex·Dump COllvcrsion
subdivision.

       Section 5 provides that the Secretary is to collect and maintain infonnation identifying the

countries to which production is shifted and, to the extent feasible, from which articles are

imported that result in certifications under this chapter and in the number of certifications

relating to each such country. The provision qualifies the collection ofinfonnation on imports

"to the extent feasible" because it is sometimes difficult to identify the primary source of

imported articles since such articles may have components produced in several different

countries or may be transshipped among countries.        These infonnation collection requirements

will result in the availability of infonnation relating to certfications based on shifts in production

to and imports from Mexico and Canada, which would be useful to the Congress and other policy

makers in assessing the adequacy of the consolidated program. It would also maintain a

commitment to account for program activity relating to trade with Mexico or Canada and would

facilitate eligibility detenninations for related programs, such as the North American

Development Bank and Community Adjustment and Investment Program.

       Section 6 would apply to the consolidated T AA program an enrollment in training

requirement for income support similar to the requirement that is currently included under

NAFTA-TAA. Under this requirement, in order to be eligible to receive income support under

the program while in training, a worker must be enrolled in training not later than either the last

day of 16th week of a worker's most recent total qualifying separation or the 8th week after a

certification of eligibility is issued. The Secretary may extend these periods by 45 days if there

are extenuating circumstances, such as a course is cancelled or the first available enrollment date

for a particular program is later. This requirement encourages workers to make training


                                                  18

     decisions early in their spell of unemployment which will accelerate reemployment and enhance

     the adjustment process.

               Section 7 specifies the conditions under which a waiver may be issued from the general

     requirement that a worker be enrolled in training to receive income support. This provision is a

      hybrid between the T AA program, which provides general waiver authority where training is

     deemed to be not "feasible or appropriate" for a worker, and NAFTA-TAA which does not allow

     any waivers of the requirements.

               Specifically, the new provision allows a waiver under the following seven conditions: (l)

     the worker has been notified that the worker will be recalled to employment; (2) the worker has

     marketable skills as determined pursuant to an assessment; (3) the worker is within two years of

     qualifying for retirement benefits under the Social Security Act; (4) the worker is unable to

     participate in training due to health (except this does not exempt the worker from available for

     work requirements otherwise applicable to the receipt of income support); (5) the first available

     enrollment date is within 45 days; (6) there are insufficient funds for training under the chapter;

     or (7) the duration of training appropriate for a worker exceeds the duration of income support

     available under TAA, and financial support for the additional period cannot be assured under

     other Federal or State programs. The Secretary is to specify the duration of each waiver and

     periodically review the waiver to ensure the basis for granting it remains applicable to the

     worker.

            These requirements are intended to ensure that the primary purpose of income support

     under the Act -- to assist workers while they are participating in training -- is maintained while

     allowing for reasonable exceptions under certain circumstances.

        Section 8 would expand the period for which a worker may continue to receive income

support during breaks in training. Currently, a worker may not receive income support during a

break in training if the break exceeds 14 days. This imposes hardships on certain workers,

particularly over the winter holidays. In addition, since training is increasingly being provided

through community colleges and other institutions with breaks scheduled longer than 14 days,

this limitation will be increasingly problematic. The amendment would extend the

break-in-training period to 30 days, which would generally accommodate training institution

schedules while preserving the linkage of income support under the program to participation in

training.

        Section 9 would provide a training cap for the consolidated program of $150 million.

Currently, the cap for the TAA program is $80 million and the NAFTA-TAA is $30 million.

The increase is intended to address the expansion of eligibility due to shifts in production, an

expected increase in the programs take-up rate due to the Department's administrative efforts to

expand outreach, and to account for the reduction in the number oftraining waivers expected

under the revised rules.

        Section 10 would eliminate a quarterly report to the Congress on training expenditures.

The report appears to be oflimited utility. The Department has been and will remain committed

to ensuring that Congress is fully informed regarding expenditures under the program, especially

where it is anticipated that the expenditures will reach the cap.

        Section 11 provides for expanded coordination between the consolidated T AA program

and the dislocated worker program administered under the Job Training Partnership Act and its

successor, the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Specifically, this section provides that the


                                                   20
                            Hex-Dump Conversion


coordination is to include common reporting systems and elements, including elements relating

to participant data and performance outcomes. This information will facilitate enhanced

cooperation between and assessments of the two programs.

       In addition, this section provides that in ensuring workers are provided

employment-related services, the Secretary is to ensure such services include services at one-stop

career centers. These centers are being established throughout the country pursuant to the

Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and will be an invaluable resource in providing information, .

services, and referrals to T AA participants.

       Section 12 provides that the Secretary may authorize funds under this chapter to be used

to provide supportive services to enable eligible workers to participate in or complete training.

These services, su.ch as transportation and child care, may be critical to facilitating a worker's

participation in training and are authorized under JTP AlWIA training programs.

       Section 13 contains additional conforming amendments relating to the repeal of

NAFTA-T AA and revised certification requirements.

       Section 14 provides that contingency funds are to be made available to the consolidated

T AA program if appropriated funds are exhausted in any fiscal year. This provision does not

supersede and is subject to the $150 million cap on training expenditures. These funds are to be

made available from funds in the Treasury that are not otherwise appropriated and will ensure

that the commitment to provide assistance to adversely affected workers is not breached.

       Section 15 would authorize appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal

years 1999-2001 for trade adjustment assistance for firms under chapter 3 of title II of the Trade

Act of 1974, which is administered by the Department of Commerce. This authorization period


                                                 21
                            TIex-Dump Conversion


 is consistent with the authorization period for trade adjustment assistance for workers under

 chapter II that is provided in section 2 of this bill.

         Section 16 establishes the Presidential Commission on Workers and Economic Change in

 the New Economy. The Commission would conduct a study of issues relating to economic

 dislocations and worker adjustment. This section provides that the study is to examine the impact

 of trade, technology, and changing work organizations; the effectiveness of existing adjustment

 programs and strategies; and the role of public-private partnerships. The Commission would be

 composed of 15 members appointed by the President and include members of Congress,

 workforce development professionals, educators, State agency heads, and business and labor

 leaders. Within 18 months of establishment, the Commission is to issue a report on the results of

 the study, including a compendium of best practices relating to worker adjustment, and

 containing any administrative or legislative recommendations.

         Section 17 provides the effective date and transition provisions. Section 17(a) provides

. that, except where otherwise specified, the provisions of the Act are to take effect on October 1,

 1999, or 90 days after enactment of this subtitle, whichever is later, in order to allow for a

 transitional period. Section 17(b) authorizes the Secretary to establish appropriate rules to

 facilitate or orderly transition from the separate TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs to the

 consolidated program.

                     .2/8/99                                      GENERAL STATEMENT
IN EXPLANATION OF SUBTITLE B                                 TRADE ADJUSTMENT
ASSISTANCE REFORM ACT OF 1999


        Subtitle B contains the "Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 1999." By
combining the best features of the existing Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and the NAFTA
Transitional Adjustment Assistance (NAFT A-T AA) programs into a consolidated T AA program,
this subtitle would provide effective, comprehensive, and timely assistance to workers adversely
affected by international trade.

        This legislation follows through and expands upon the commitment made by the
President to improve and expand Trade Adjustment Assistance to workers. The draft bill.
would authorize the consolidated TAA program for two years, through fiscal year 2001. The
consolidated program would expand eligibility to workers who lose their jobs due to shifts in
production by their firm to other countries. Currently, T AA eligibility is restricted to workers
adversely affected by imports and NAFTA-TAA is limited to workers adversely affected by
imports from or shifts in production to Mexico or Canada. This expanded eligibility will
ensure comprehensive assistance is available to workers who lose their jobs due to imports from
or shifts in production to any foreign country.

         This proposal also ensures that rapid response and basic readjustment services will be
made available to workers upon the filing of a petition for TAA eligibility. These services are
critical to facilitating rapid reemployment of workers and provide important information to those
workers relating to the resources available at the Federal, State and local level to assist them. In
addition, the legislation requires a one-third reduction in the time period for the Department of
Labor to process petitions for certification of eligibility under T AA; increases the annual cap on
training expenditures to $150 million; and provides contingency funds should the program
exhaust appropriated funds in any fiscal year.

       The legislation also harmonizes the differing rules of the programs relating to requiring
enrollment in training as a condition for receiving income support. These rules would retain the
program's emphasis on linking income support to training while allowing specified, limited
exceptions where appropriate to assist certain workers. In addition, the bill would assist workers
by expanding the period for scheduled breaks in a training program during which a worker may
continue to receive income support.

       The legislation also contains provisions enhancing coordination between the consolidated
TAA program and the dislocated worker program under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA)
and the successor Workforce Investment Act of 1998. In particular, this subtitle would


                                                23
                              11 u{oll1a{ed Records Management System
                              Hex-Dump Conversion


    significantly enhance the accountability of the consolidated program by ensuring that T AA and
    the dislocated worker program have common performance outcome measures and information,
    which would include information on the placement in employment, earnings (including wage
    replacement) and retention in employment of participants. The legislation would also require
    coordination to ensure workers have access to employment-related services available in one-stop
    career centers and would authorize the use of funds to provide supportive services .


           . The legislation also assures that information will be collected and maintained identifying
    the countries to which production is shifted and from which articles are imported that result in
    certifications and the number of certifications relating to each country. This will include
    information on the number of certifications relating to imports from or shifts in products to
    Mexico or Canada, which will assist in making eligibility determinations under related NAFTA
    programs and in assessing the adequacy of the consolidated program.


            This legislation would build on administrative efforts already undertaken by the
    Department of Labor to improve adjustment assistance to workers adversely affected by foreign
    trade. The legislation would be supplemented by the Administration's commitment to make
    funds available under the National Reserve Account in the JTP AlWIA dislocated worker
    program to address the needs of workers in firms that are secondarily affected by international
    trade -- that is suppliers to directly affected firms and assemblers and final processors of articles
    produced by such firms. These workers would be eligible to receive the same assistance available
    to workers under the consolidated TAA program.

           In addition, the legislation includes a provision extending the Adjustment Assistance for
    Firms program administered by the Department of Commerce under chapter 3 of title II of the
    Trade Act of 1974. Finally, the subtitle includes a provision authorizing a Presidential
    Commission on Workers and Economic Change in the New Economy that is consistent with the
    President's commitment.

           Together, these reforms would provide critical assistance to help workers who lose their
    jobs due to international trade to obtain reemployment and ensure that all Americans can benefit
    from economic change.
