    MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

    FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                          ELENA KAGAN

    CC:                   LORETTA UCELLI

    SUBJECT:              POSSIBLE POLI.CY ANNOUNCEMENTS


    CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

    1. Introduction of Legislation to Prohibit Discrimination Against Parents (late April/early
    May) The President proposed new federal legislation to protect parents from discrimination in
    the workplace. Senator Dodd is almost ready to introduce the President's proposal. Building
    on state law in Alaska, Michigan, New Jersey, and others, this legislation would protect workers
    from unfair assumptions about their commitment to their job that can affect hiring, advancement
    and other employment decisions. While this law would clearly not prohibit employers from
    making hiring and promotion decision on the basis of job performance, it would ensure that
    workers are not unfairly discriminated against simply because they are parents.

    2. Release New Child Care Report (Ready May 1) At our request, HHS is developing a
    report on the high cost of child care for low and moderate income working families, and their
    needs for child care assistance. The report would include information on the expense of child
    care and present data on the specific costs of child care for families at certain income levels,
    making the case for the need for child care assistance. The report would also include previously
    released data on the small numbers of low income families currently receiving subsidies. [Please
    note, report does not exist yet, but HHS has agreed to produce it.]

    3. Announce New After-School Grants (late May) (also submitted by Education team) The
    President could release $100 million in 21st Century Learning Grants for after-school programs
    across the country, the second part of the $200 million total grant distribution for FY 1999. This
    is an opportunity to highlight the after-school initiative in the President's FY 2000 budget, which
    triples funding for the program from $200 million to $600 million.

    4. New Adoption Numbers (date tbd) The President (and First Lady) could announce the
    significant increases in adoptions since 1996. We will also be able to announce the awarding of
    the financial bonuses to states for their adoption increases.
CRIME                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

The President could announce new pieces of 21st Century Crime Bill:

1. Victims/Bioterrorism (Week of April 19-24 -- Crime Victims Week and anniversary of
Oklahoma City Bombing) The President could highlight provisions in his crime bill to address
the threat of bioterrorism, and provide additional assistance to victims of crime.
        Bioterrorism: The crime bill includes new tools for law enforcement to address the
        emerging threat ofbioterrorism and prevent future bioterrorism catastrophes.
        Specifically, the bill contains new criminal and civil penalties for:
        - Possession of harmful dangerous biological agents not justified for peaceful purpose, in
        order to limit the availability of biological weapons to the general public;
        -Unregistered possession of certain biological agents to ensure that appropriate authorities
        can track who is handling the most deadly agents;
        -Reckless handling of harmful biological agents, similar to those already in place for
        radioactive materials and pharmaceutical products; and
        -Possession of selected biological agents by restricted individuals, such as felons,
        fugitives, and the mentally unstable.
        Victims: The crime bill contains a number of provisions to support victims, including
        expanded federal assistance to the victims of non-federal crimes and additional
        compensation and assistance to victims ofterrorism and mass violence. The President
        could also renew his call for the Congress to pass a Constitutional Victims Rights
        Amendment.

2. New Firearms Proposals The week before the introduction of the crime bill, the President
could unveil the new firearms proposals that will accompany that crime bill. This could be a
White House ceremony with supportive Members of Congress. These new proposals include:
       a. Making permanent the Brady waiting period requirements that expired last
       November;
       b. Closing the gun show loophole and providing for background checks at all gun
       shows;
       c. Banning the importation of all large capacity ammunition clips (including those
       originally grandfathered by the Assault Weapons Ban);
       d. Banning violent juveniles from owning guns for life;
       e. Requiring federal gun dealers to sell child safety locks with every gun sold;
       f. Holding adults who allow children easy access to firearms criminally responsible for
       their reckless actions;
       g. Limiting the purchase of handguns to one per month (We have not yet decided to
       include this provision);
       h. Enhancing certain gun penalties, providing for the forfeiture of guns used to commit
       crimes, strengthening the federal firearms licensing system and procedures, providing for
       Brady background checks to purchase explosives, and more.
We may also be able to simultaneously release a new Justice Department report detailing how
many illegal gun sales were stopped through Brady Background checks in 1998, and since the
Brady Law's enactment (probably well over 300,000). [Still needs to be confirmed with Justice.]
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion



EDUCATION

1. Release Dept. of Education's Guide to Ending Social Promotion (Ready -- pending close
of ESE A discussions) To announce the release of the Education Department's Guide to Ending
Social Promotion, and to make clear that 1) the President's call to end social promotion does not
mean simply retaining students, but providing a comprehensive approach to ensure that students
meet promotion standards the first time, and 2) his budget includes the resources -- smaller class
size, after-school, teacher quality, reading tutors -- to help states and school districts prepare
students to meet high standards.

2. Release Charter Schools Study (Ready now) This is the third year of a five year study.
The study contains updates from previous years on such issues as school size, reasons parents
give for sending their kids to charter schools, reasons for starting schools, etc. POTUS could
visit a DC charter school and 1) release the report, 2) highlight the choice $ in the FY2000
budget, 3) perhaps announce the competition for the new funds won in the FY99 budget, and 4)
reaffirm support for charter schools and refute allegations that Bill Lan Lee is using civil rights
enforcement to undermine charter schools. We have a recommendation for a charter school in
D.C. that the President could visit in conjunction with this announcement.

3. Release of Update on Tennessee Star Study on Class Size (April 29) Sen. Murray, NEA
and other education groups are planning to release this report at the National Press Club. The
Start study is a longitudinal study that is tracking the academic progress of children in Tennessee
who were assigned to small classes in grades K-3 as part of an academic reform experiment.
Earlier results from the study showed that children that were in these smaller classes did better in
the early grades, and continued their academic performance even after being returned to larger
classes.

4. Gun-Free Schools Act Data (May) The President could release data on the number of
violations of the gun-free schools act. Also, the Safe' and Drug-Free Schools Office will award
schools that have achieved significant gains in making their schools safer.

5. 45th Anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education (May 17) To commemorate the
anniversary of this 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing segregated schools, the President
could highlight a new initiative in his FY 2000 budget for interdistrict magnet schools. This
budget proposal includes at $10 million increase in the existing magnet school grant program to
develop high-quality special programs at schools that are open to all students from participating
districts to reduce racial isolation. This expansion would be targeted toward urban districts with
high concentrations of minority and poor students that partner with suburban districts. This
increase would fund 5-10 grants to states for planning and implementation activities.
The President could also highlight an initiative to help prepare disadvantaged students for AP
courses and tests, thereby increasing their access to college -- and helping to make entering
college classes more diverse. We have requested $20 million for the Advanced Placement
Incentive program, an increase of $16 million, to increase opportunities for students to enroll in
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

and complete advanced courses and train teachers for those courses. We could also highlight the
President's request of$240 million for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for
Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), and increase of$120 million, to help give an estimated
381,000 disadvantaged students the skills and encouragement they need to successfully pursue
postsecondary education. This request would support early intervention services such as
mentoring, tutoring, and career counseling in nearly 1,000 high-poverty middle schools.

6. America Counts (late May) America Counts is putting together a "National Commission on
Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century", which Senator John Glenn has agreed
to chair. This commission will review the current state of American K-12 math and science
education, and produce a report focused on specific action steps that federal, state and local
policymakers can take to address teacher supply and quality issues in math and science
education. The announcement of the full committee should be ready sometime in late May.

7. Release Department of Education Report on School Choice (Scheduled to be ready in
June, but slightly flexible) This report will describe the various options for public school choice
in districts across the country. The report could be released during a visit to a worksite, charter,
magnet or other innovative school. We could also highlight the public school choice section of
ESEA. [If the President travels to FL, MN or CA we could highlight the new initiative on
worksite schools. These are mainly K-3 schools that allow working parents to have their
children attend a school at the work site. Parental participation at these schools is particularly
high.]

HEALTHCARE

1. New Actions to Protect Blood Donors and Transfusion Recipients. (June) We could
announce new actions by the Food and Drug Administration to safeguard the safety of our
blood supply. These actions include adding new requirements for testing of blood or
plasma prior to release or shipment, requiring blood banks to take measures to prevent the
spread of Hepatitis C, such as quarantining prior collections from donors who
subsequently test positive for Hepatitis C, taking action to identify donors at increased risk
of transmitting the disease, and conducting outreach efforts to locate transfusion recipients
who may have received infected blood. These actions respond to a series of
recommendations made by the GAO, the Institute of Medicine, and the House Committee
on Government Reform and Oversight and take critical new steps towards assuring the
safety of our blood supply.

2. Patients' Bill of Rights/Presidential Rank Awards for Distinguished Executives.
(OPM has submitted a scheduling request for this but we could likely tie it in with our issues,
particularly, PBOR): The President could announce the 52 awardees from many federal agencies.
These winners are members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) whose work has improved the
programs and the federal departments where they work in innovative ways. Both the President
and Vice President have announced these awards in past years. There is already a scheduling
request in at Cabinet Affairs for April 29. OPM proposes to tie the announcement ofthe winners
with highlights of the Administration's policies -- ~, OPM's winner, Ed Flynn, helped develop
                                                                          Hex.Dump Conversion


the federal government's Patients Bill of Rights. Mr. Flynn and OPM also helped develop the
federal government's long-term care proposal. NOTE: This event could only be done in the
context of a larger Patients' Bill of Rights announcement.
CIVIL RIGHTSIIMMIGRATION

1. Asian American and Pacific Islander Executive Order (May) A proposed EO, entitled
Increasing Participation ofAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Federal Programs, is
currently pending clearance.    This EO was proposed by Asian Pacific American leaders to
address the fact that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are underserved in certain federal
programs, including health, education, housing, labor, and economic and community
development. The EO is similar to EOs addressing under-representation of African-Americans
and Latinos in federal education programs. This EO is more focused on health and human
services. The President could participate in a signing ceremony or event during May, which is
Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.

2. Public Charge Regulation Roll-Out          (May) The INS is expected is to release a
proposed regulation that clarifies the basis upon which a immigrant may be found a
"public charge" for the purposes of exclusion, adjustment of status and deportation.
Studies and anecdotal evidence have shown that legal immigrants and sometimes U.S.
citizens who are eligible to receive federal public benefits such as Medicaid and participate
in the Children Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are not applying for those benefits for
fear that they will be penalized under immigration laws. State and loca,l governments,
immigrant advocacy groups, health care organizations, Members of Congress and others
have been pressing for guidance on this issue for nearly a year and are very anxious to get
clarification as soon as possible. The President could make a public statement about the
regulation and urge Congress to enact his FY 2000 budget proposals that provide states the
option to provide health services to immigrant children and pregnant women and provides food
stamps benefits to legal immigrants.

3. Race Book Roll-Out (May?) Discussions are currently under way regarding methods to
roll-out the race book when it is completed. Under consideration are: I) White House
announcement, with simultaneous events hosted by Cabinet across the country; 2) White House
event coupled with announcement of either a White House Conference on Race or a series of
sectoral leadership conferences across the country; 3) roll-out at a White House Conference on
Race; or 4) book announcement at an out-of-D.C. location, e.g., University of Mississippi,
where they are opening the Institute for Racial Reconciliation.


TOBACCO

1. Release Report on Youth Smoking Prevention (Early May) Release new report showing
how few states are investing tobacco settlement funds to prevent youth smoking (report being
prepared by outside public health groups), using the event to call upon the Congress to ensure
settlement money is used to prevent youth smoking.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
2. Unveil new measures making the tobacco industry documents more accessible. (May)
On May 23rd, the tobacco companies are supposed to make certain specified documents
available on their web sites, according to the terms of the state settlement.

3. Statement on Full FDA Authority Over Tobacco Products (April-May-June) Make a
strong statement in support of full FDA authority on the day the Supreme Court makes a decision
on whether to review the FDA case from the Fourth Circuit. If the court takes the case,
arguments will be considered in the 1999-2000 session. Whether or not the court decides to take
the case, we should continue to push for legislation to confirm the FDA's authority over tobacco
products. While the court refusing to take the case would be a setback, it may provide us with
additional ammunition to argue for a change in statute.

4. Announce the Filing of Department of Justice Litigation Against the Tobacco Industry.
(Date tbd)


WELFAREIEMPLOYMENT

1. Welfare to Work Transportation Grants (Late April-early May) The President could
announce the awarding of$75 million in welfare to work transportation grants, using the
opportunity to promote our welfare to work spending proposals including doubling funding for
these grants in FY 2000. These will be the first grants awarded under the Administration's
Access to Jobs initiative included in TEA-2. This would ideally be announced in a state or
community who is receiving a grant.

2. Announce Federal Government's Model Plan for Employment of People with
Disabilities (May) (currently being revised). This plan, directed by the U.S. Office of
Personnel Mangament (OPM), is based on recommendations from the Presidential Task Force on
Employment of Adults with Disabilities. The Model Plan will address the following areas:
recruitment and hiring; reasonable accommodation; career opportunities; and data collection.

3. Food Stamp Regulations (May-June) Announce new Food Stamp regulations to improve
access for working families (in development; regulatory offsets needed).

4. Fathers Day Message (June 20 -- note that the·President will be out of the country on this
day) Issue guidance to states and communities on how federal programs (including T ANF,
WtW, child support, and others) can support responsible fatherhood, using the opportunity to
plug our Welfare-to-Work reauthorization initiative. There are two related conferences
occurring around this time: the National Fatherhood Institute Summit in Washington on June
14th, which will include a bipartisan group of mayors, and an International Fatherhood
Conference sponsored by the National Center for Strategic Non-Profit Leadership in San
Francisco 5/31 - 6/3. (Could make a good VP announcement.)

5. One-Stop Employment Center Event (June-July) The President could announce new
employment numbers (due out June 4/July 2nd) at a One-Stop centers created by the new
                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

     Workforce Investment Act to provide employment and training assistance.

     6. Ninth Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.       (July 26) Announcements to
     be developed.

     7. Welfare to Work Partnership Convention, Chicago, IL (August 2-4) Address the Welfare
     to Work Partnership convention in Chicago, August 2 - 4 of several thousand businesses from
     dozens of cities. The President could announce the $200 million in high performance bonuses for
     states that have done the best job placing welfare recipients in jobs and ensuring they succeed in
     those jobs, and announce the first Individual Development Account grants to help low income
     families build assets, which should be ready July 27th. If caseload reductions continue at
     current pace, the President should be able to announce that the President has cut welfare rolls in
     half since he took office. This event could serve to mark the third anniversary of the welfare
     reform law (8/22/96) and the 2nd anniversary of the Welfare-to-Work program (8/5/97).


     HOMELESS

     1. Homeless Report. (Tentatively ready in a month, likely sooner if we pushed for it.) We
     could announce the results of the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and
     Clients, which is the first-ever comprehensive survey of both clients and providers of
     homeless programs funded by the federal government. Representatives of 11,909
     programs out of an estimated 40,000 nationwide were interviewed, and 4,207 people who
     use the programs were interviewed. The survey will show that 15 percent of the homeless
     respondents have one or more children under the age of 18 with them; that 28 percent of
     respondents say they sometimes or often do not get enough to eat, compared to 12 percent
     of poor Americans; and 38 percent report alcohol use problems, 26 percent drug use
     problems, and 39 percent mental health problems, and 66 percent report one or more of
     these problems. The report does not estimate the total number of homeless persons. The
     announcement of the survey could be combined with another push for our FY2000 budget
     for HUD which includes $1.125 billion for homeless assistance. If enacted, the $1.125
     billion will be the largest ever appropriation to HUD for homeless assistance.


     FOOD SAFETY/NUTRITION

     1. Food Safety Event. (Timing: OMB wants time but could be pushed to get the rule
     out.) We can urge Congress to pass funds for our food safety initiative, support Harkin's
     bill to give USDA recall authority for tainted food, and announce a new rule regulating
     eggs to prevent salmonella. The FDA rule now at OMB (and its USDA companion already
     completed and set to go into effect in August) will require eggs to be kept at 40 degrees and
     put warning labels to consumers on each carton. There are at least 800,000 cases of
     salmonella a year and eggs are the leading culprit. They project a median savings of $700
     million in reduced health care costs (OMB analysis includes a range of $87 million to $6
     billion). The cost ofthe rule to companies is $60 million the first year, $10 million a year
                                                                                   Hex.Dump Conversion


     afterwards. USDA also has a reinventing government rule clearing OMB to move from a
     regulatory approach on sanitation of meat and poultry plants to a performance setting
     standard method which companies will like and shows we are interested in flexible means
     of achieving goals.


     2. Nutrition Executive Order. (Late May) USDA and consumer groups have urged us to
     establish an inter-agency council on nutrition. While there has been a relatively recent
     scientific recognition of the important connection between diet and disease prevention,
     (well-covered in Newsweek, Time, and elsewhere), the Administration has little
     coordination between our health and nutrition programs at HHS and USDA. If given a
     choice, the groups would prefer a WH Conference on Nutrition and have approached
     Chris Jennings about it. The Council would operate like our food safety council and hold
     public hearings, report on what we know about the topic, and recommend ways to link our
     programs at HHS and USDA better.


     NATIVE AMERICANS

     1. Native American Education Foundation. (Needs to go through OMB clearance,
     possibly ready by May). The Department of the Interior proposes legislation to establish a
     non-profit Native American Education Foundation. This legislation would create a
     foundation similar to the National Park Foundation and would permit the Foundation to
     solicit donations for the furtherance of Native American education for grades K-12. While
     there is an American Indian College Fund, there is no existing non-profit that focuses on
     this issue ofK-12 education for Native American children. The Foundation would be able
     to give funds to support projects such as developing American Indian cultural curriculum,
     research on American Indian education, and initiating model programs to improve Native
     American education. This effort would build upon the Native American executive order
     that the President signed last August. Senator Inouye has indicated that he would like to
     sponsor this legislation, and Interior expects that they will be able to garner additional
     support. This proposal has received support from the Native American education
     community, particularly from the National Indian Education Association (NIEA) and the
     American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC). OMB is worried that staffing
     the Foundation would cost money, Interior is trying to reach an accommodation.


     ENDANGERED SPECIES

     1. Endangered Species Act Delistings
     a. Bald eagle -A proposal to delist the bald eagle is set to be announced on July 4, 1999.
             Perhaps we should push to move up.
     b. Peregrine falcon -Similarly, the final proposal to delisting the peregrine falcon is set to be
     announced in August 1999.
