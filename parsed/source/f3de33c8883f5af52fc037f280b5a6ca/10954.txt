                                    FYOO Territories Issues


CHIP
    The budget would quadruple Children's Health Insurance Program funding for the
     territories with $34 m. (Congress agreed to a one year $32 m increase last year.)

Rum Tax
    The budget would give Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands the full $l3.50 per gallon of
     the tax on the islands' and foreign rum vs. $10.50 now. It estimates this at $34 m for P.R.
     and $12 m for the V.1. annually -- but the P.R. estimate is probably far too low.
     One-sixth of the additional $3/gal. P.R. revenue would be for the P.R. Conservation
     Trust.

IF NECESSARY:
     The proposal is for five years to address Ways and Means' primary objection to our
      proposal last year: a permanent increase over $10.50. It could be extended in 2004

30A
      The budget would open IRC Sec. 30A (the tax credit based on wages and other spending
       in Puerto Rico by companies based in States) to new investments and extend it past 2005.
       Estimated tax relief of $450 m over five years and $5 b over 10.

IF NECESSARY:
     Two differences from our past proposals: It (1) would not repeal a 2002 cap on the
      credit individual companies can take and (2) extends 30A to 2009 vs. indefinitely.

      Those provisions would have increased the cost to $738 m over five years and $7.7 b over
       lOin FYOO from $607 m over five and $6.2 b over 10 under our numbers -- which are
       significantly less than Joint Tax's -- in FY99. The tax relief of our FYOO proposal is the
       same as that of our past proposal in FY98.

      There was little effort in Congress on behalf of our proposal last year. Archer has refused
       to consider it.

      This proposal: preserves the primary objective of opening the credit to new investment;
       provides as much tax relief as we originally intended; may be more achievable; and keeps
       the issue alive for further extension ifthere is the will for that.

Puerto Rico R&E
      The budget would extend the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit to Puerto Rico
    . since some income from P.R. of companies based in States is now being taxed.

Guam Compact Impact
    The budget would hike reimbursement of Guam's costs due to migration made possible
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
       by the free association compacts with other Micronesian areas from $4.6 m to $10 m.
Virgin Islands Tariff Credits
      The budget would authorize tariff credits for jewelry made in the islands.

Empowerment Zones
    The budget would not include the territories in empowerment zones because they have
     greater tax incentives for investment -- Secs. 936 and 30A-- but we are considering
     including territories when those incentives expire.

Medicaid
     The budget does not propose lifting the cap on Medicaid in the territories (1) to
      concentrate on increasing CHIP and (2) due to the costs to which they do not contribute.

      Equal treatment might cost over $1 b a year.

SSI
      The budget does not propose extending SSI to the territories (1) due to the close to $1 b
       a year costs to which they do not contribute.

Education Act
     The budget does not propose equal treatment of Puerto Rico (1) because it already gets
      more than all but eight States and (2) that would give it more than all but three States.

Medicare
     We will consider changing the formula for hospital rates in Puerto Rico from SO%ofthe
      national rates/SO% local cost factors to one using a greater percentage of national rates.

Cigarette Tax
     We are considering extending the cigarette tax to the territories since (1) it is to
      discourage health damaging smoking and (2) raise revenue for health programs that
      benefit the islands.

        Revised Final 1/29/99 12:15pm


         PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
        RADIO ADDRESS ON EQUAL PAY
        THE WHITE HOUSE
        January 30, 1999

                Good morning.  Americans have always believed that people who work
        hard should be able to provide for themselves and their families.  That is
        a fundamental part of AmericaD,s basic bargain. Today, I want to talk to
        you about what we are doing to make sure that bargain works for all of our
        people, by ensuring that women and men earn equal pay for equal work.

                We are living in a time of remarkable promise. Our economy is the
        strongest in a generation -- with nearly 18 million new jobs, the lowest
        unemployment in 29 years, family incomes rising by $3,500, and the
        greatest real wage growth in over two decades. We have an opportunity
        and an obligation -- to make sure that every American can benefit from
        this moment of prosperity.

                One of the best ways to meet this challenge is by putting an end
        to wage discrimination. When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act
        35 years ago, women were joining the workforce in ever-increasing numbers


   but their work was undervalued. At the time, for every dollar a man
brought home in his paycheck, a woman doing the same work.earned only 58
cents.

        We have made a lot of progress since those days. Last June, my
Council of Economic Advisors reported that the gender gap has narrowed
considerably -- in fact, we have nearly cut it in half. Today, women earn
about 75 cents for every dollar a man earns.

        We should be proud of this progress   but 75 cents on the dollar is only
three quarters of the way there. Americans cannot be satisfied until we
are all the way there.

        One big reason why the pay gap persis'ts - - despite womenD, s gains
in education and experience -- is the demeaning practice of wage
discrimination in our workplaces. Too many employers still undervalue --
and underpay    work done by women.

        Make no mistake: When a woman is denied equal pay, it doesn't just
hurt her -~ it hurts her family, and that hurts America.  Between 1995 and
1996 alone, the number of families with two working parents increased by
nearly two million. And in over ten million families, the mother is the
only breadwinner.

        Just think what a 25 percent wage gap means in real terms.  Over
the course of a working year, it means hundreds, even thousands of bags of
groceries ... visits to the doctor ... rent and mortgage payments.  Over
the course of a working life, it can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars
    smaller pensions ... and less to put aside for retirement.

        To prepare our nation to meet the challenges of the 21st Century, we must
do more to ensure equal pay, equal opportunity, and equal dignity for
working women.

        Today, I am pleased to announce a new $14 million Equal Pay
Initiative, included in my balanced budget, to help the Department of
Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity commission expand opportunities
in the workplace for women and end wage discrimination once and for all.
with more resources to identify wage discrimination, to educate employers
and workers about their rights and responsibilities, and to bring more
women into better-paying jobs, we will be closer than ever to making equal
pay a reality for every American.

        In my State of the Union address, I called on Congress to ensure
equal pay for equal work -- and it brought members of both parties to
their feet in an unanimous show of support.   We know that equal pay is
not a political issue-- it is a matter of principle, a question of what
kind of country we want American to be today, and in the 21st Century,
when our daughters grow up and enter the workplace.

        There has been strong leadership on fair pay from members in both
houses of Congress, including Senator Harkin and Representative Norton.
Today, I calIon the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, sponsored
by Senator Daschle and Representative DeLauro -- legislation that   .
strengthens enforcement of our equal pay laws, expands opportunity for
women, and helps working families to thrive.  This should be one of
CongressD, first orders of business.

        If we meet this challenge, if we value the contributions of all
AmericaD,s workers, then we will be a more productive, prosperous and

   .   proud nation in the 21st century.

               Thanks for listening.
