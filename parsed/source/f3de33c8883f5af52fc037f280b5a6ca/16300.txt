CONGRESS TODAY (7/16)
SENATE
Passed (99-0) S. 1004 - Energy and Water FY 1998 Appropriations bill

defense funds from DoE programs to DoD programs and objects to large
increases in Corps water projects]

Began consideration of S. 955 - Foreign Operations FY 1998 Appropriations
bill
        [SAP sent 7/16: Admin. Supports]

While under consideration, the Senate took the following action on S. 955:
o       Approved (Unanimous Consent) McConnell amendment that places an
additional provision on assistance to Cambodia by conditioning assistance


to that country upon the Secretary of StateD,s confirmation that the
current Cambodian government was not installed by force or coup. Funding
for non-governmental organizations will be allowed to continue.
o        Approved (95-4) Smith amendment that makes aid to Russia
provisional upon the President reporting to Congress that a Russian bill
currently awaiting signature by President Yeltsin, which would place
restrictions on the activities of non-accredited religious groups and
foreign missionaries, had not become law, and that such restrictions were
not being enforced in Russia.
o        Approved (voice vote) McConnell amendment that restores full
funding for assistance to Egypt as an earmark. The earmark for Jordan was
retained. While he sponsored the amendment, Sen. McConnell did express
his concern over Egyptian President MubarakD,s actions (not attending the
Mid-East Peace summit in Washington, D.C. last October, calling his own
Arab round table, etc.) which were seen as significant challenges to the
Middle East peace process.
o        Approved (voice vote) Harkin amendment, which the Administration
supports, that allows resumption of TDA, IMET, and OPIC assistance to
Pakistan.
o        Approved (voice vote) Murkowski amendment that conditions funding for
KEDO upon certification by the President that N. Korea has not violated
the Military Assistance act of 1953.
o        Rejected (35-64) Allard amendment that would have reduced funding
for OPIC administrative expenses from $32 million requested by the
Administration and provided in the Senate bill to $21 million (the 1994
level) .
o        Rejected (38-60) Dodd 2nd degree amendment which would have
temporarily suspended the drug certification process for U.S. assistance
to foreign countries engaging in major drug trafficking for two years.

use the balance for deficit reduction)

While under consideration, the House took the following action on H.R.
2158:
o       Rejected (193-235) Kennedy motion to recommit the bill to
conference with instructions to increase funding for HUDD,s Community
Development Block Grants by $100 million, and include $50 million for
Brownfields.
o       Passed (voice vote) Tiahrt amendment that reduces funding for the
Americorps program within the CNCS by half, and increases funding for VA
Medical and Prosthetic Research by $25 million.
o       Withdrew the Wise amendment that would have transferred $3
million from EPAD,s Environmental Programs and Management account to the
Chemical Safety Hazard and Investigations Board.

million FEMA Windstorm research.

o       Rejected (200-227) Sensenbrenner amendment that would have
reduced NASAD,s Human Space Flight account by $100 million.
o       Withdrew the Foley/Bachus/Miller amendment that would reduce CDFI
funding to $50 million so that members could work out language agreeable
to both sides (prior to conference) .
o       Passed (voice vote) Solomon amendment that adds language
guaranteeing that VA Medical care receive $579 million, in addition to the
$16.598 billion appropriated. This language ensures that VA Medical Care


will be funded at $17.537 billion, regardless of how much VA is able to
collect in third-party fees.
