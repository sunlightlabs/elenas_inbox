MEMORANDUM FOR JUDY WINSTON AND SYLVIA MATHEWS

FROM:          Michele Cavataio for the Cabinet Affairs Working Group

SUBJECT:       Race Initiative "At the Table" Update

This memo summarizes our proposal for an At the Table-type initiative for the
President's Initiative on Race (PIR). While this proposal is a work-in-progress, this
memo outlines the development of the proposal to date: its goals, objectives, title,
resources, press strategy, participants, audience, and kick-off strategy. We would like
to have your approval to move forward. The Working Group has met three times
and involved former staff from the White House Women's Office who developed the
original concept. Our goal is to send out the first round of Administration
appointees over the Thanksgiving holiday.

There are 8 issues where we would welcome your suggestions:

1. Goals.   The objectives of this effort are to:

    Hear .about the issues that are important to the American people in their
     communities
    Inform the American people of the Race Initiative. (We will give out
     documents which highlight PIR and Administration activities and
     accomplishments on this issue to participants.)
    Activate the Administration's appointees in the PIR effort and better utilize
     them as the eyes and ears of the Administration. (They put a human face on
     the PIR, the Federal government, and this Administration that provides every
     roundtable participant with a unique and personal contact with those entities.)
    Bring information back to the Administration
    Identify community efforts and community leaders to support the PIR

2. Name of event. The Women's Office is going to restart their At the Table effort
   so they have asked that we distinguish it from the PIR effort. We have come up
   with the following suggestions for a new name which we will share with the WH
   and PIR communications staff for their input:

    One America: Bringing It Home
    Bridging Divides: President Clinton's Conversations on Race

                                                                                   1
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion'
    In the Conversation: American Voices on Race
    Voices on Race
    One America: Conversations that Bring us Together

3. Attendance.    As of June 20, 1996, the Women's Office organized approximately
   800 At the Tables, averaging 10-30 women in more than 40 states. We have not
   calculated a participant goal, but believe that the PIR roundtables could be larger
   due to the larger scope of the PIR. The PIR would seek at least as many
   roundtables with the same average number of participants. In general,
   roundtables will vary. For example, someone like Secretary Herman could
   handle a larger roundtables (30-100) in which eleoed officials (e.g., local
   officials, Senators) and others are invited. A Schedule C, on the other hand,
   would most likely have a smaller roundtable (e.g., 10) in a home. Among other
   variables, these roundtables will make a special effort to focus on youth. We
   could, for example, encourage appointees to return to their colleges and high
   schools to conduo the roundtables. The roundtables will also be non-partisan --
   Independents, Republicans, Democrats and others will be encouraged to
   participate.

   We discussed the issue of ensuring diversity among participants in each
   roundtable. While we felt that diverse participation was an advantage in the
   roundtables, we felt that we should still encourage participation with non-diverse
   groups because many neighborhoods and towns lack diversity. We agreed that
   we would encourage diversity but permit the appointees to assemble the people
   that are available to them.

4. Appointees to partidpate in the {lISt round The goal for attendance is to seek as
   many appointees as possible to participate in one or more of these sessions. We
   believe that the kick off over Thanksgiving could be a test effort using some of the
   more experienced appointees. We are planning to invite the Federal Agency
   liaisons to the PIR, surrogate speakers (appointees) who have been identified by
   Cabinet Agencies, and a few Cabinet members to participate in the first round.
   We would also like to have the President and Vice President commit to
   participating in roundtables as part of the kick off announcement. (In fact, the
   President has already done some sessions if you include the meeting with white
   ethnic groups and the coming meeting with black farmers.) We would like to
   enlist 50-100 senior appointees for the first round. We would ask them to
   assemble their own roundtables, but we would help support them by providing
   contacts and other resources. The second round, which would take place over the

                                                                              2
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


   Christmas and Hanukkah holiday, could include more SubCabinet and Schedule
   C's. The roundtables will continue after the holidays, but we believe the holidays
   will provide an opportunity for a big initial push that will generate significant
   interest and press.

5. Materials, training, and feedback report. The Women's Office put together a
   packet for At the Tables, which provided appointees a tool for setting them up,
   holding them and reporting back to the Women's Office. We believe that the
   Race Initiative can adopt all of the materials that the Women's Office used with
   some edits and additions. The main piece that is missing is a document which
   gives some guidance on how to get the conversation started and includes help on
   setting ground rules and managing conflict. Given the emotional nature of race
   issues, we believe that it is important to provide information which helps ensure
   the smoothest session possible. Included in the materials will be a form for
   appointees to report their findings, identify leaders and describe community efforts.
     These reports will be collected and synthesized into on-going reports to the
   President and could be included in the President's Report to the American People.
     We plan to provide all materials for review and obtain approval for our effort
   from the Counsel's Office.      In addition to providing materials, we would like to
   invite the appointees for a briefing / training to prepare for their roundtables.

6. Questions to pose at the roundtables. The Working Group has made some effort
   to identify suggested questions for use at the roundtables. Mter careful
   consideration, we believe that rather than have a full-fledged, interactive dialogue
   on race, the mission of the sessions should be to bring back information to the
   President about what Americans care about and want him to do about race issues.
      Thus, we believe that the dialogue should be directed by a general question
   which elicits responses from participants about their own communities and
   experiences but does not try to direct the conversation to a specific race issue or
   area. One possibility is:

          When was the last time that issues around race relations affected you or
          your community? Are you aware of any positive efforts in your
          community to address these issues? What do you want the President's
          Race Initiative to know and to focus attention on?

   Given the potential volatility of discussing race issues, an open question such as

                                                        3                      3
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

   this may take the conversation in many directions. However, the advantage of
   this sort of question is that when a dialogue becomes heated, the moderator can
   keep returning to the mission which is to bring back information and advice to
   the President.

7. Press Strategy. The press that this project is able to generate is of great value as
   we believe that it will inform many people of the existence of the PIR. The
   Women's Office received a commitment from Family Circle, which has a
   readership of 26 million, to do a feature piece on the At the Table concept. The
   PIR, which again has a broader scope, could receive significant press coverage
   with the right planning. We will work with WH, PIR and agency
   communications offices to maximize the coverage, but we will need assistance to
   ensure appropriate coverage of events.

8. Resources. At the Tables were a major project undertaken by the Women's
   Office which had a very limited staff. We understand that they had one person
   dedicated to the project full-time with other staff providing significant help at
   certain intervals (e.g, recruiting appointees through brown bag lunches at
   agencies, reviewing the incoming reports, writing reports.) We will probably
   need to dedicate one person full-time for the near-term and receive significant
   support from several offices.
