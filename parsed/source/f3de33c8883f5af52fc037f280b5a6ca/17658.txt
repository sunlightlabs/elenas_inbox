                       OPEN AND FAIR TRADE

        We need a progressive growth strategy in which we take every action possible to
       ensure that all Americans can benefit from economic change. We need to break
       out of the old arguments that say you are either for blocking change or you are
       for the market, but everyone has to fend for themselves. Government needs to
       help workers, communities and those not in the job market take advantage of the
       opportunities of expanded trade.

       THE PRESIDENT, WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, HAS DEVELOPED
       A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF INITIATIVES TO HELP ENSURE THAT ALL
       AMERICANS SHARE IN THE BENEFITS OF OPEN TRADE. This nine-part strategy
       increases funds for worker and community adjustment, while doing more to tap the untapped
       potential of our inner cities and poor rural communities.

       The plan (1) expands resources to workers who lose their jobs, (2) helps communities get back
       on their feet and (3) helps tap the untapped potential of America's poor rural and urban
       communities.

      PRESIDENT CLINTON'S STRATEGY TO HELP WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES
      SUCCEED IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY. The Clinton Administration rejects the view that in the
      new economy, workers should be "on their own." This plan -- developed with Members of Congress --
      illustrates the Administration's vision of economic growth: While we tear down foreign barriers and
      open foreign markets, we are going to work to bring more Americans into the winner's circle. In order
      to help more Americans succeed in a global economy, this plan, which will be part of the President's
      fiscal year 1999 budget, increases funds for worker and community adjustment, while doing more to tap
      the untapped potential of our inner cities and poor rural communities.

       Worker Adjustment:

       I.     Improve and expand Trade Adjustment Assistance and ensure a quick response for worker
              dislocation;

      II.     Expand dislocated worker funding by $750 million over five years -- so that funding in 2003
              would be triple what it was in the year before President Clinton took office;

       III.   Dedicate $250 million over next five years in existing funds for secondary workers -- while
              initiating an information campaign to reach out to them more effectively;

      IV.     Create a Trade Adjustment Assistance Contingency to ensure that funds are available to help
              workers who lose their jobs due to trade -- including those who lose their jobs due to future trade
              agreements negotiated under Fast-Track authority -- receive benefits;


      Community Adjustment:

      V.      Provide $250 million for community adjustment -- create an Office of Community and Economic
              Adjustment to coordinate the response to trade-impacted areas;

      VI.     Improve and expand the North American Development Bank (NADBank);

      VII.    Improve environmental protection along the border by making infrastructure financing more
              affordable;

      VIII.   Improve Export Assistance Centers so that they do more to help small businesses; and


      Tapping The Untapped Potential ofAmerica's Poor Rural and Urban Communities:

      IX.     Expand current initiatives that have proven records of helping to create jobs and opportunity for
              disadvantaged Americans.

       I.     IMPROVE AND EXPAND TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE AND ENSURE A
              QUICK RESPONSE FOR WORKER DISLOCATION. To make economic adjustment
worker and trade adjustment programs work better.

      REAUTHORIZE TAA AND NAFTA-TAA FOR TWO YEARS. Both the House
       Ways and Means and the Senate Finance Committees have approved an extension ofTAA
       and NAFTA-T AA for two years. (T AA and NAFTA-T AA expire on September 30,
       1998.) The Administration supports this reauthorization. CBO estimates the costs of the
       NAFTA-TAA extension for two years at about $102 million. While a two-year T AA
       extension costs $662 million, it does not require offsets since it is already included in the
       baseline.

      GIVE WORKERS IN FIRMS WHICH SHIFT PRODUCTION TO ANOTHER
       COUNTRY TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE. Under TAA., workers may only
       be certified for assistance if their firm is adversely affected by imports. Under
       NAFTA-T AA, workers may be certified if either their firm is adversely affected or their firm
       shifts production to Mexico or Canada. As part of the President's FY99 budget, the
       Administration would propose legislation to give workers in firms which shift production to
       another country trade adjustment assistance. Covering shifts in production under TAA, as
       well as NAFTA-T AA, would cost $69 million per year or about $345 million over five
       years.

      ISSUE GUIDELINES TO PROMOTE GREATER USE OF "RAPID RESPONSE"
       FOR WORKER DISLOCATION. Based on the recent experience with layoffs at Fruit
       of the Loom in Louisiana, the Labor Department will issue guidelines to the states
       promulgating that "rapid response" should be used for all substantial layoffs and plant
       closures. Rapid response is the initial information sharing activity (for employees, as well
       as employers) to facilitate access to all public programs -- this process helps individuals
       look for new jobs, while assessing their needs for reemployment services. The activity
       would occur as soon as the State receives a Worker Adjustment and Retraining
       Notification (WARN) notice of any substantial layoff or plant closure, or when the State
       becomes aware of such event through other sources.

      CUT CERTIFICATION TIMES BY ONE-THIRD. In order to cut the TAA
       certification time from 60 days to 40 days, the Department of Labor will take the following
       four steps: (1) reduce investigator caseload to allow for more timely follow-up in obtaining
       relevant company and customer data; (2) develop an enhanced in-house system for tracking
       import trends and performing import-impact analysis; (3) reduce the amount of time from 21
       to 14 days between the day the Labor Department requests and receives data from
       companies; and (4) reduce the response time for the customer survey from 21 to 14 days.
       Technological improvements as well as possible staffing increases will allow the
       Department to assemble, review, and analyze investigative data and information in a more
       timely manner. The total cost for these improvements would be about $2.5 to $3 million
       over five years.

                                Hex-Dump Conversion


      MODIFY WAIVER FOR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR TAA AND
       NAFT A-T AA SO THAT THEY ARE SIMILAR. TAA requires that a participant be
       enrolled in training in order to qualify for income support; however, waivers of the

                                           2
            under NAFTA-TAA. As part of the President's FY99 budget request, the
            Administration would propose to narrow waiver authority under T AA and loosen it under
            NAFTA-T AA. This would serve to both reduce the abuse of the waive provision under
            T AA and to harmonize the two programs. The costs of this proposal are undetermined,
            but it is likely revenue-neutral.

           IMPLEMENT PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR TAAINAFTA-TAA
            PROGRAMS. The Labor Department does not receive information on how workers do
            after they participate in either T AA or NAFTA-T AA programs. To ensure that the
            programs work effectively, the Labor Department is developing and implementing
            performance measures, and collecting outcome-based performance data for workers who
            receive adjustment assistance. This will permit better tracking of TAAINAFTA-T AA
            program effectiveness, and promote improved outcomes for participants. These
            performance measures will be implemented within current administrative cost and program
            budgets.

           CREATE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON "WORKERS AND ECONOMIC
            CHANGE IN A NEW ECONOMY." The Administration will create a commission on
            "Workers and Economic Change in a New Economy." This commission will study
            businesses' best practices in the areas of education and on-the-job training, and the
            opportunities for improving trade-related training programs; specificaUy examining
            the Federal-State and public-private partnerships in helping educate and train
            America's workers for the next century. The Administration will seek to include
            workforce development professionals, academics, state workforce or labor commissioners,
            union leaders, business leaders, and Members of Congress. This commission will be
            appointed by the President and will report back to him with its results by December 1,
            1998.


II.    EXPAND DISLOCATED WORKER FUNDING SO THAT FUNDING IN 2003 WOULD
       BE TRIPLE WHAT IT WAS IN THE YEAR BEFORE CLINTON TOOK OFFICE.

           $750 MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN DISLOCATED WORKER FUNDING
            OVER FIVE YEARS. In the year before President Clinton took office, the dislocated
            worker program was funded at $517 million. Since President Clinton took office,
            dislocated worker money has more than doubled, allowing some 300,000 more dislocated
            workers to receive training this year than five years ago. The Administration proposes to
            increase funding so that a total of $750 million more in dislocated worker funding is
            provided over the next five years. And that means that the resources for dislocated
            workers in 2003 will be more than triple the $517 million funding in the year before
            President Clinton took office.

III.   EARMARK $250 MILLION IN EXISTING FUNDS FOR SECONDARY WORKERS --
       WHILE INITIATING AN INFORMATION CAMPAIGN TO REACH OUT TO THEM

                                               3

   $250 MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS IN SECRETARY'S DISCRETIONARY
    FUND EARMARKED FOR SECONDARY WORKERS. In conjunction with the
    passage offast-track authority, the Department of Labor will issue a Statement of
    Administrative Action extending the Secretary's discretionary authority to use JTP A Title
    III funds to serve secondary workers in finns doing business with primary firms eligible for
    or certified for T AA. To ensure that adequate funding in available the Secretary of Labor
    will fence off $250 million over the next five years to provide job training and income
    support for secondary workers.

   CLARIFY THAT SECONDARY FIRMS CAN BE CERTIFIED FOR ASSISTANCE
    EVEN IF PRIMARY FIRM DOES NOT APPLY FOR CERTIFICATION. Some
    have expressed concern that secondary finns were being denied benefits because the
    relevant primary finn had not obtained certification. There are cases when the primary
    finn does not go through the certification process, but the secondary finn is adversely
    impacted from trade. Therefore, the Secretary of Labor will clarify that secondary firms --
    adversely affected as a result of business lost with a primary finn -- can be certified for
    assistance, even if the primary firm does not apply for T AA or NAFTAfTAA certification.
    In order to certify these firms, the Labor Department will need to do broader, two-tiered
    investigations. This will cost an estimated $5 million over five years.

   INITIATE INFORMATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE THE TAKE-UP RATE
    OF SECONDARY WORKERS. Many secondary workers do not know they are eligible
    for training and income support. This informational campaign will work to raise their
    awareness of these programs. Outreach efforts can successfully reach many workers who
    are not, but should be, receiving job training and income support. The resulting increased
    case load could require 4-5 FTEs, at a cost of $2 million over five years. The
    Administration proposes four methods to raise the secondary worker take-up rate:

    a.     The best way for the Labor Department to find secondary workers is to start with
           the primary finn and work outwards. By December 1997, the Labor Department's
           Employment Training Administration will issue guidelines to the states requesting
           that they seek information from primary firms about their suppliers during or
           immediately following the certification process. This information will fonn the
           basis of a concerted effort to identify and locate potentially eligible secondary
           workers.

    b.     By December 1997, the Labor Department will issue a set of guidelines so that
           direct contact with potentially eligible secondary finns and their workers is made.
           The Labor Department will also disseminate fact sheets and posters to these
           secondary businesses, and will make information available to personnel offices.
           The Labor Department will also set up a bilingual web site to help contact
           secondary workers.

    c.     The Labor Department will distribute information to State Employment Service and
           Unemployment Insurance offices where workers go to file unemployment benefits.

    d.     In order to increase the take-up rate among secondary workers, the Labor
           Department would run a public education campaign using public service


                                        4
                 for the bidding process will be in place by December 1997 and the competition will
                 begin soon thereafter. In seeking bids for the project, the Department will include
                 in the specifications a requirement that the firm have experience with the Hispanic
                 m~dia in the region and will ask bidding firms to submit evidence of prior
                 successful public education campaigns.



IV.   CREATE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE CONTINGENCY TO ENSURE THAT
      ALL WORKERS WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS DUE TO TRADE -- INCLUDING THOSE
      WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS DUE TO TRADE AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED UNDER
      FAST-TRACK AUTHORITY -- RECEIVE BENEFITS.

         CREATE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE CONTINGENCY. While the
          Administration believes that trade agreements are beneficial for the country -- with more jobs
          being created on net than lost -- we understand the concerns of those who believe workers will
          be adversely affected by these agreements. Thus, to be certain that no one is left behind, we
          are proposing a Trade Adjustment Assistance Contingency that automatically will make
          additional adjustment assistance available for workers who have lost their jobs due to trade --
          including those people who lose their jobs due to trade agreements negotiated under fast-track
          authority. Additional funds will be made available in increments if adjustment assistance
          demands ever exceed the estimate in our budget. While we fully expect this contingency will
          not trigger on, with this safety net added to the Trade Adjustment Assistance program there
          should be no question that resources will be there if the need ever arises.

      CREATE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT TO
      COORDINATE RESPONSE TO TRADE-IMPACTED AREAS.

          EXPAND COMMUNITY ADJUSTMENT BY $250 MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS --
           CREATE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT TO DEAL
           WITH TRADE-IMPACTED REGIONS. DOD's Office of Economic Adjustment
           (OEA) was the Administration's first point of contact with communities experiencing a
           military base closure or defense plant closing. Learning from the defense conversion
           experience, we would create an OEA-type body -- the Office of Community and Economic
           Adjustment -- to coordinate the Administration's response to trade-impacted regions by
           working with Labor, Commerce, SBA, HUD, Treasury, and other government entities. This
           group would provide planning grants and expertise to help communities develop
           comprehensive economic adjustment strategies. They also would bring the appropriate
           state, local and federal groups to the table to provide adequate resources for implementing
           plans. The expert staff at OEA could be detailed to this body to help trade-impacted regions
           and workers. Moreover, to ensure there is proper funding for regions adversely impacted by
           trade, the Administration will expand the Economic Development Administration (EDA)'s
           Title IX budget. In 1997, Title IX had$27 million in funding to help areas with sudden and
           severe economic dislocation, such as major plant closings. The Administration will propose
           $50 million per year -- or $250 million over five years -- in community adjustment funding,
           more than doubling EDA's Title IX budget eachyear, while creating an Office of
           Community and Economic Adjustment. This will allow for comprehensive economic
           development assistance to regions adversely impacted by trade, or other severe economic
           dislocations.


VI.   IMPROVE AND EXPAND NADBANK. The Administration proposes a three-point plan to
      improve and expand the North American Development Bank (NADBank):

          EXPAND FINANCING FOR THE NADBANK CAIP. The Administration proposes
           expanding paid-in capital for the North American Development Bank (NADBank)
           Community Adjustment and Investment Program (CAli by $37 million -- a full 160
           percent increase over existing funds. These new funds will allow the Bank to leverage
           private capital markets to provide over $150 million in additional financing to
           trade-affected communities. The additional resources could finance new actitities, such
           as permitting the CAIP to provide matching grants, permitting more affordable financing
           for business development in trade-impacted communities, and to develop a
           micro-lending program to address the specialized needs of dislocated workers by
           encouraging small start-ups. The CAIP could also use the additional funding to expand
           its direct lending program by providing direct loans or innovative credit enhancements
           through intermediaries to assist a wide range of commercial and nonprofit borrowers who
           would otherwise lack access to commercial lending institutions.




                                              6
              increase awareness about its programs and improve accessibility for trade-impacted
              communities. To that end, the CAIP will work to refine the criteria of the direct lending
              program to better address community needs and disseminate them widely through a
              variety of media, including by developing a bilingual Web Site with detailed explanations
              of the direct lending criteria and application forms.     In addition, CAIP would work
              with trade-impacted communities to provide technical assistance in the development of
  B           strategic plans to help identify opportunities and attract investment.
  ~
             PUERTO RICO ELIGIBILITY. Efforts must be made to permit communities within
              the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that have been adversely impacted by trade and
              production shifts associated with NAFTA to access CAIP resources. To that end, the
              CAIP Finance Committee will develop a marketing plan identifying the appropriate
              authorities and community development organizations in Puerto Rico that should be
              provided with extensive information about CAIP eligibility requirements and programs.
              CAIP staffwill work directly with Department of Labor (DOL) and Economic
              Development Administration (EDA) staff to identify communities in Puerto Rico that may
              be eligible for assistance through CAIP as well as EDA and workers who may be helped
              through NAFTA-TAA. In these eligible communities, CAIP will hold round tables with
              community groups, bankers, elected officials, and community leaders to market the
              program.


VII.   IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ALONG THE BORDER. The
       Administration will improve environmental protection along the border by making infrastructure
       financing more affordable for poor communities, strengthening community environmental
       capabilities and accelerating project approvals.

             MAKING ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE MORE AFFORDABLE.
              The North Amencan Development Bank (NADBank) and the Border Environment
              Cooperation Commission (BECC) will take steps to address the needs of poor
              communities: NADBank is establishing co-financing arrangements with U.S. and
              Mexican grant programs to provide affordable financing for border environmental
              infrastructure. We will seek appropriations of $250 million for this program over the
              next three years. NADBank is working on a proposal to help smaller U.S. communities
              access the tax-exempt bond market by establishing reserve funds for debt servicing in
              cooperation with the State Revolving Funds. This would leverage $4 million per year in
              NADBank financing to make available an additional $16 million per year for smaller
              border communities. Finally, BECC and NADBank will establish a program to assist
              residents in poor communities to finance residential hook-ups of water and wastewater
              services by providing lines of credit (through a public utility or other intermediary) to
              fund the costs of such services.




                                                  7
                developing new programs to provide technical assistance to border communities for
                environmental infrastructure development and management. In cooperation with the EPA,
                BECC is establishing a Project Development Assistance Program (PDAP) to help border
                communities develop environmental infrastructure project proposals. This Program will
                commit and disburse up to $10 million to communities by the end of the year. NADBank
                has established an Institutional Development Program (IDP) to help communities on both
                sides of the border achieve effective and efficient operation of their water, sewage and
                solid waste management services. So far, NADBank has approved $1.8 million in
                technical assistance for 12 projects, and we will seek to double total IDP resources to $4
                million.

               ACCELERATING PROJECT DEVELOPMENT: NADBank and BECC have
                developed a work plan for accelerating project development. Their 1997-99 work plan
                has identified more than 30 projects and potential projects with a total cost of more than
                $500 million. They will also take steps to expedite project approvals, especially for
                smaller border communities: Small projects (typically costing $100,000 or less) will be
                eligible for expedited processing, provided they are sponsored by an appropriate Federal
                or state agency (e.g., the Texas Water Development Board). Similar projects that meet
                BECCINADBank requirements for project quality and review will be considered for
                certification as a group and financed through a NADBank line of credit with an
                appropriate Federal or state agency.

VIII.       IMPROVE EXPORT ASSISTANCE CENTERS SO THAT THEY DO MORE TO
            HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. There are over a hundred Export Assistance Centers
            located across the United States helping businesses export American goods abroad. Small
            businesses are an essential part of America's export strategy, accounting for almost 96% of all
            exporters, but only 30% of the value of exports. As part of our National Export Strategy, we
            will:

                  INCREASE BOTH THE NUMBER OF RURAL BUSINESSES AND SHARE
                   OF SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES RECEIVING EXPORT
                   ASSISTANCE. By the end of 1999, the Export Assistance Center Network will
                   increase by 20 percent the number of small and medium-sized firms receiving export
                   assistance in the United States. To ensure this increase, the Export Assistance Center
                   Network will do more to fully engage the programs of all its strategic partners to reach
                   out to those businesses which have not ventured into foreign markets. Many small
                   businesses in poorer rural communities have not realized their full export potential.
                   To ensure more is done for rural small businesses, the Export Assistance Center
                   Network will increase its focus on manufacturers and service companies located in
                   rural areas -- with the goal of increasing by 20 percent the number of rural businesses
                   who report exporting successes through the Export Assistance Network.

                  ENHANCE AND REGULARIZE TRAINING FOR EXPORT ASSISTANCE
                   CENTER STAFF. The Department of Commerce will enhance and regularize the
                   training of all Export Assistance Center staff, improving customer service. Part of
                   this training will be increasing the familiarity of the Export Assistance Centers field
                   staff with all Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) agency programs,
                   particularly in the trade finance area.

                                                     8
       CREATE JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR DISADVANT AGED AMERICANS. In
       order to create jobs and opportunity for disadvantaged Americans, the Administration proposes
       to:

               MAKE FLEXIBLE FUNDING A VAILABLE FOR SECOND-ROUND URBAN
                                              EMPOWERMENT ZONES. The
                                              Administration would request $100 million
                                              per year in flexible grant funds for
                                              second-round urban EZs. This funding
                                              could be used for a wide range of
                             ement System     activities, including economic
      Automated Records ~ana%                 development and housing projects,
           ump Conversl0n                     project-based rental assistance, and job
      Hex-DUU'
                                              training. Providing flexible grant funding
                                              for the second-round of urban
                                              Empowerment Zones would cost $500
                                              million over the next five years.


             EXPAND THE YOUTHBUILD PROGRAM. YouthBuild provides high school
              dropouts 16-24 with general academic and job skills training, as well as apprenticeships
              constructing and rehabilitating affordable housing. The FY 1998 appropriation for
              YouthBuild is $35 million. This proposal would provide, beginning in FY 1999, an
              increase of $10 million per year -- or $50 million over five years -- for Y outhBuild (above
              the FY 98 level).

             CREATE OPPORTUNITY AREAS FOR OUT-OF-SCHOOL YOUTH. The
              Administration requested and continues to advocate strongly for $250 million in
              competitive grants to selected high-poverty urban and rural areas, including designated
              EZs and ECs, to increase out-of-school youth employment. The House
              Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill includes $100 million in funding for FY
              1999; the Senate bill $250 million (also advance funded). The Administration will work
              to ensure that the out-of-school youth program receive $250 million per year, or $1.25
              billion over five years.

             $500 MILLION IN WELFARE-TO-WORK TRANSPORTATION FUNDS. The
                    r\.dministration requested $100 million for an unspecified number of projects.
                    The initial House bill provided $42 million for 10 projects. The Senate transit
                    legislation reported by the Banking Committee fully funds the President's
                    request. To help move people from welfare-to-work, the Administration will
                    continue working to secure full funding for welfare-to-work transportation
                    funds. The Administration will work to ensure that welfare-to-work
                    transportation funds receive $500 million over the next five years.

             $225 MILLION FOR CDFIs TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT
              IN DISTRESSED URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. The Community Development
              Financial Institution (CDFl) fund is designed to expand the availability of credit,


                                               9
    urban and rural communities. The Administration requested $125 million for CDFls,
    but the Treasury-Postal conference report provided $80 million for FY98. The
    Administration will propose a $45 million increase over the conference report in our
    next budget -- that's $225 million over five years for CDFIs.



   ENHANCE AND BUILD ON TAX PROVISIONS FOR EQUITY INVESTORS IN
    SSBICs. The Administration is committed to ensuring the success of the initiatives
    contained in the President's 1993 Economic Plan to encourage investments in
    specialized small business companies (SSBICs). The Administration would work with
    Congressman Jefferson and Congressional tax-writing staffs to enhance the
    effectiveness of these provisions through proposed modifications. These proposed
    modifications would cost on the order of$50 million over five years.
