                   OPTIONS FOR HEAD START REAUTHORIZATION

The FY99 Pre'sident's budget increases Head Start $3.8 billion over the five year period FY99 to
FY03. This funding level is sufficient to meet the President's goal of serving 1 million children
by 2002, including 80,000 children in Early Head Start. The budget provides for a full inflation
adjustment and "quality" set-aside in FY99. However, because outyear policy was deferred to the
reauthorization cycle, less than the full current law amounts for the traditional COLA or set-aside
are in the budget for the outyears. The amounts for quality and COLA for FY 2000 to 2003 are
between $40 to $260 million.

Policy was deferred because the effectiveness of the quality set-aside and COLA in raising
quality is not clear. HHS argues that the salary and benefit increases and the new staff paid for
with the "quality" money help to improve student-to-teacher ratios and increase staff retention,
and that these are proxies for quality. However, important points to consider when discussing
Head Start quality are:

      There is no evidence indicating that these funds have lowered student-to-teacher ratios or
       improved staff retention. Furthermore, there is a significant body of research showing
       that improved teacher salaries do not result in improved educational outcomes for
       children.
      The Head Start Performance Standards set required student-to-teacher ratios that are
       designed to ensure a uniform level of program quality. These standards can be met
       within current funding levels.
      Head Start providers currently earn $9 to $16 per hour, well above the average child care
       worker's hourly wage of $6 to $7.
      COLA increases have been given in Head Start every year of the Clinton Administration.
         Given the size of the base appropriation, even freezing participation requires a COLA
       increase of over $100 million annually. Grantee staffs in other programs in HHS'
       Administration for Children and Families, and very few social programs, if any, receive
       COLAs by statute. In particular, neither the COPS program nor the new Class Size
       Reduction Initiative include provisions that provide automatic COLAs.
      Even if these funds do improve quality, one can argue that there is still no need to
       continue the set-aside because these funds have permanently increased the average amount
       spent per child. Since 1993, this Administration has invested over $600 million in new
       quality activities. When we consider that each year these funds go into the base and then
       get inflated in subsequent years, we have cumulatively spent over $1.2 billion on quality
       activities since 1993. Therefore, there are already sufficient funds in the base to continue
       activities previously funded with the "quality" investment set-aside.

The debate comes down to one of slots versus automatic set-asides, and as the discretionary caps
become tighter in the outyears, it becomes increasingly necessary to prioritize.
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

Providing the current law COLA and set-aside would add $1.6 to $1.8 billion to the cost of Head
Start expansion from FYOO to FY03. Roughly $550 to $750 million is due to the set-aside; $900
to $1,000 million is due to the COLA; and the remainder is due to interactions between the
COLA and the set-aside. The costs are high because there is a compounding effect, i.e., each
year the current law COLA and quality set-aside go into the base and then get inflated in 
subsequent years.

OPTIONS

Option 1

       Authorize appropriations for quality set-aside and COLA at the Administration's
       dil?cretion, not to exceed the levels currently authorized.
       Require HHS to use part of the quality funds to track the use of quality dollars and
       evaluate the effects of these investments on outcomes for children.

       Pros:     Provides flexibility to make funding decisions on a year-by-year basis,
                 resulting in potentially large savings. This flexibility allows the Secretary the
                 choice of maintaining the FY99 budget path.
                 Results in valuable information on meritorious uses of the quality set-aside.

       Cons: .   Some argue that this option may upset Congressional consensus on Head
                 Start; may be seen as an inconsistent position on quality, thereby jeopardizing
                 the Child Care Initiative; and can be seen as compromising the President's
                 commitment to Head Start.
                 Puts pressure on the Administration to debate this issue every year when
            \    making funding decisions.                                            .


Option 2

      Structure quality set-aside so that it continues to be 25 percent of the Head Start increase,
       but provide quality funds for one-time expenditures, such as facilities improvements,
       salary bonuses based on merit, purchase of educational materials, playground
       equipment, teacher training, transportation services, etc. Since funds go for one-time
       purchases, the amounts do not need to go into the base.
      Require grantees to apply for quality funds on a competitive basis.
      Remove requirement that at least 50 percent of quality funds mustgo to salary and benefit
       improvements.
      Require HHS to use part of the quality funds to track the use of quality dollars. and
       evaluate the effects of these investments on outcomes for children.
      Authorize appropriations for a COLA at the Secretary's discretion, not to exceed the
       levels currently authorized.
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

Pros:   By redirecting quality funds to one-time improvements/purchases, eliminates
        need for quality funds to go into the base and get inflated. The increase over
        the FY99 budget caused by this policy 톓s $600 million less than the increase
        caused by providing the current law COLA and quality set-aside.
        Results in obtaining timely information on actual uses and net impact of the
        quality set-aside.
        Provides opportunity to refine the quality set-aside and target dollars to
        activities that have more clear cut benefits.
        Rewards grantees that propose uses for quality funds that have proven merit.
        Maintains quality investment as a set-aside equaling 25 percent of the
        program's increase.
        Provides flexibility to make funding decisions regarding the size of the COLA
        on a year-by-year basis.

Cons:   Makes public the concern with the current structure.
        Flexibility to lower COLA may be seen as a threat to teacher retention.
        Removes guarantee that every grantee will receive quality funds.
        Elimination of compounding effect for quality set-aside reduces rate of long
        term Head Start spending, considered by some to be an independent goal.
