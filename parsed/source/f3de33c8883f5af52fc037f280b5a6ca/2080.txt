                               TEEN PREGNANCY EVENT

                            DATE:            May 2, 1997
                            LOCATION:        Roosevelt Room
                            TIME:     2:00 pm - 3:00 pm
                            FROM:            Bruce Reed/Elena Kagan


I.    PURPOSE

      To demonstrate the Administration's commitment to reducing teen pregnancy and to
      highlight the one year anniversary of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy
      and their first 12 honorees. The event also recognizes the month of Mayas Teen
      Pregnancy Prevention Month.

II.   BACKGROUND

      The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy is a private nonprofit organization
      dedicated to preventing teen pregnancy. It formed in response to President Clinton's
      challenge, issued in his 1995 State of the Union address, that "parents and leaders across
      the country ... join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy." May 1997
      marks the campaign's first anniversary.

      Following his State of the Union comments, the President held a meeting at the White
      House with a group of prominent teen pregnancy prevention experts and advocates to
      discuss what could be done to combat the problem. From that meeting came a private
      sector planning effort that led to the creation of the national campaign.

      The campaign is chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean. Its Board of
      Directors includes Whoopi Goldberg, Katherine Graham, the Hon. Nancy
      Kassebaum-Baker, the Hon. Warren B. Rudman, and William Galston. Isabel V.
      Sawhill, President of the campaign, was an Associate Director of the Office of
      Management and Budget during President Clinton's first term.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

Today, at an earlier event on Capitol Hill, the campaign distributed three reports. The
first, Whatever Happened to Childhood chronicles the problem of teen pregnancy in the
United States. Using mostly previously released data, the report finds that: 1) although
we are making some progress, there is much more work to do and, 2) despite consistent
community-based efforts, the evidence has not born out a simple solution to the problem
so we must continue to be creative, innovative and persistent in our efforts. A second
report, Snapshots from the Front Line, provides examples of ways that communities are
working to prevent teen pregnancy, highlighing some oftoday's honorees. The
campaign is also distributing a previously released report No Easy Answers: Research
Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy, which concludes that there are no
single or simple approaches known to markedly reduce adolescent pregnancy, but that
nearly all sex education program produce some socially desirable outcomes (such as an
increase in knowledge) and that programs that focus on sexuality do not increase sexual
activity.

At the close of the program you will recognize 12 honorees chosen by the Campaign who
will be seated in the front row. Each represents prevention approaches that are lowering
teen pregnancy rates and strengthening communities. The honorees' work embodies
several key themes that are essential to preventing teen pregnancy:
       Emphasizing values and self-esteem in working with adolescents;
       Forging partnerships with the corporate sector;
       Focusing the community on a "unity of goal" to prevent teen pregnancy
        even when there are conflicts over program approaches;
       Encouraging adult-child communication;
       Involving youth in the discussion;
       Emphasizing the importance of male involvement in prevention;
       Recognizing the importance of program evaluation; and
       Involving the media in reducing teen pregnancy.

In your remarks, you will discuss two new teen pregnancy prevention grant programs and
new findings from a study of childbearing and family planning released yesterday by the
Department of Health and Human Services.

Grants: In Los Angeles yesterday (May 1), Secretary Shalala announced the two new
community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote responsible behavior.
One program will be aimed at teenage girls and the other at teenage boys. Both grow out
of HHS' new Girl Power! Campaign which is aimed at enhancing self-esteem, promoting
good health, and preventing unhealthy behaviors among girls 9 to 14 years old. Each of
the grant programs will total about $1 million per year and involve public-private
partnerships organized by individual communities.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

           HHS Study: The Secretary also discussed a newly released study which shows that teen
           sexual activity declined from 55 to 50 percent during the 1990s after increasing steadily
           for more than two decades. The decline is small -- 10 percent -- but significant because it
           shows that the long-term increase in teenage sexual activity may finally be over. This
           data is part of a new study of child bearing and family planning covering all women
           15-44.
