The final FY99 budget represents a significant step forward for America, protecting the surplus until
Social Security is refonned, forging a bipartisan agreement on funding the International Monetary Fund,
and putting in place critical investments in education and training, from smaller class sizes to after-school
care, and from summer jobs to college mentoring. While the final budget is clearly a win for President
Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Congressional Democrats, there is still more work to do to prepare
America for the 21 st century. Unfortunately, Republicans blocked school modernization, Patients Bill of
Rights, comprehensive tobacco legislation, child care investments, and campaign finance refonn.

Saving Social Security First. The President's commitment to           SaJ4~~ffiPfe~Wne!f~OPirst held the
line against several Republican efforts to drain the surplus.

Investing in Education and Training. While House Republican tried to slash their education budget
by over $2 billion, President Clinton and Congressional Democrats delivered on their education agenda:
         More High-Quality Teachers With Smaller Class Sizes: $1.2 billion for the first year of the
         President's new initiative to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades to a

         teachers and will insure that students will receive more individual attention, a solid foundation in
         the basics, and greater discipline in the classroom.
         After School Programs: $200 million to expand programs and serve a quarter of a million

Much Work Still Left to Do:
In the waning days of the session, the President and Congressional Democrats prevailed in making critical
investments to advance the President's comprehensive education agenda. Much work remains for the future
because Republicans in Congress killed, at least for now, critical priorities, including:

x     School Modernization. Beginning with his State ofthe Union address, the President fought all year
      to modernize our schools. His fully paid for tax credits would have leveraged nearly $22 billion in
      bonds to build and renovate schools. In the final days of the budget negotiations, Republicans in
      Congress refused to even meet on the critical issue of school construction.

      Patients Bill of Rights. President Clinton repeatedly urged the Congress to pass a strong,
      enforceable patients' bill of rights that would assure Americans the quality health care they need.
      Congressional Republicans killed this year's effort to pass a Patients Bill of Rights.

      Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation. This year, President Clinton made passage oflegislation to
      reduce youth smoking a top priority, in order to stop kids from smoking before they start through a
      significant price increase, measures to prevent tobacco companies from marketing to children, and
      critical public health prevention and education programs. Congressional Republicans opted to act as
      politicians instead of parents, and killed this year's effort to pass bipartisan comprehensive tobacco
      legislation to reduce youth smoking.

      Campaign Finance Reform. At the beginning of the year, the President made passage of bipartisan,
      comprehensive campaign finance reform a priority for his Administration. After months of delay, the
      House of Representatives overcame defenders of the status quo and passed the Shay-Meehan bill.
      However, the Senate Republicans killed this historic legislation.

      Child Care Initiative. In his State of the Union, the President proposed an historic child care
      initiative to make child care better, safer and more affordable for America's working families. The
      President's proposal included $7.5 billion over 5 years for child care subsidies for low-income
      working families and tax credits to help 3 million working families pay for child care. The
      Republicans refused to support these critical investments.

      Work Incentives Bill for People with Disabilities. At the commemoration of the Americans
      with Disabilities Act last July, the President endorsed the bipartisan Jeffords-Kennedy bill that
      enables people with disabilities to go back to work by providing an option to buy into Medicaid
      and Medicare, as well as other pro-work initiatives. This bill was on the list of top
      Administration priorities in the final budget negotiations, but rejected by Republicans. The
      President will continue to fight to give people with disabilities the opportunity to
      work --including the critical health insurance that makes work possible.

x     Speeding Toxic Cleanups. President Clinton called for an additional $650 million -- a 40 percent
      increase -- to accelerate Superfund cleanups with a goal of completing a total of 900 cleanups by
      2001. The Republican majority refused these funds, threatening to delay cleanup at up to 171 sites
      across the'country,


                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dwnp Conversion
        CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS WIN ON THE BUDGET
                                         October 15, 1998


Saving Social Security First
In his State ofthe Union address, President Clinton asked a basic question -- "what should we do
with this projected surplus?" -- and gave an historic four-word answer: "Save Social Security First."
 With our fiscal house in order, marked by the first budget surplus in a generation, President Clinton
is determined to seize this unique opportunity to strengthen this most important program for
generations to come. Protecting the surplus is a key step towards enacting Social Security reform.
President Clinton defeated repeated efforts to squander the surplus and, at the end ofthis Congress,
it remains intact.                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
Invests in Education and Training
In the face of House Republican efforts to slash their education budget by more than $2 billion,
President Clinton and Vice President Gore delivered on their education agenda:

NEW EDUCATION AND TRAINING INITIATIYES IN FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT:

       More High-Quality Teachers With Smaller Class Sizes. In his State of the Union address,
       President Clinton said, "Tonight, I propose the first-ever national effort to reduce class size in
       the early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers." Throughout
       the year, Republicans failed to consider this important initiative. The final budget provides
       $l.2 billion for the first year of the President's new initiative to hire 100,000 new,
       well-prepared teachers, to reduce class sizes in the early grades to a national average of 18.

       GEAR-UP: College Mentoring Initiative To Help Up to 100,000 Students Prepare for
       College. In his State of the Union address, President Clinton urged Congress "to support
       our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children, starting
       in the 6th grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that
       they, too, will be able to go on to college." The President proposed $140 million to get this
       effort started, but the House appropriations bill denied funding and the Senate provided only
       $75 million. The final budget provides $120 million for this new initiative which was
       authorized as part of the higher education legislation enacted on October 7th. GEAR-UP
       will expand mentoring efforts by States, and provide new grants to partnerships of middle
       schools, institutions of higher education, and community organizations, to provide
       intensive early intervention services to help prepare up to 100,000 students at
       high-poverty middle schools for college.

       Child Literacy Initiative to Help Children Read Well By the End of the Third Grade.
       In 1996, President Clinton proposed an America Reads Challenge to help three million
       children improve their reading skills. In 1997, he insisted that the new initiative be
       included as part of the Balanced Budget Agreement. With this budget; he has won the
       $260 million that he proposed to help ensure that all children can read well and
       independently by the end of third grade. The budget includes the legislation creating
       a program that is consistent with the President's America Reads proposal. The new
       program will provide competitive grants to States to (1) improve teachers' ability to
       teach reading effectively; (2) promote family literacy programs to help parents be their
       child's first teacher; and (3) improve the quality of tutoring programs by supporting
       Youth Opportunity Areas To Help Increase Job Opportunities for 50,000 Youth in
       High-Poverty Communities. Authorized in the Workforce Investment Act, President
       Clinton's Youth Opportunity Grants to direct resources to high-poverty areas, including
       Empowennent Zones and Enterprise Communities, to provide comprehensive services
       designed to increase employment and school completion rates for disadvantaged youth. The
       President's FY99 budget included $250 million for this new innovative program. While the
       House Republican budget did not fund this critical initiative, the final agreement includes the
       full $250 million request, which will help provide job training and social services to 50,000
       youth.

       New Learning Anytime, Anywhere Initiative. The President's FY99 budget included a
       new initiative to enhance and promote distance learning opportunities -- learning outside the
       usual classroom settings, via computers and other technology -- for all adult learners. The
       final budget includes $20 million for the Education and Labor Departments to implement this
       new initiative to demonstrate new high-quality uses of technology for distance learning in
       post-secondary education and training, and to help provide more accurate labor market
       infonnation.

       Teacher Recruitment and Preparation -- $75 million. On October 7th, President Clinton
       signed legislation that had incorporated the President's Teacher Recruitment and Preparation
       proposal. While House Republicans did not fund this important initiative, the final budget
       provides $75 million, which will help recruit and prepare thousands ofteachers to teach in
       high-poverty urban and rural communities and will strengthen teacher preparation programs
       across the country.

       Training New Teachers to Use Technology Effectively. President Clinton's FY99 budget
       requested $75 million to train new teachers in how to use technology to improve student
       achievement. The House and Senate Republicans denied the request. The final agreement
       includes the full $75 million the President requested.

     Hispanic Education Action Plan To Attack Unacceptably High Drop-Out Rate.
     Because the high-school drop-out rate of Hispanics is unacceptably high, President
     Clinton's FY99 budget included the first-ever Hispanic Education Action Plan. As
     part of this plan, the President proposed significant increases in Title I funding and a
     number of other programs that enhance educational opportunity for Hispanic
     Americans. The final budget includes increases of $524 million for these programs;
     for example, it provides a $301 million increase for Title I; $600 million for TRIO
     college preparation programs, an increase of $70 million over FY 1998, which will
     provide support services for over 700,000 students; and $50 million for Bilingual
     Education Professional Development -- double the FY 1998 level-- to begin to provide
     20,000 teachers over five years with the training they need to teach Limited English
     Proficient students.
                                                               Automated Records Management System

       Expanded After-School Programs To Serve A Quarter of A Million Children. In his
       State ofthe Union address, President Clinton asked Congress to "dramatically expand our
       support for after-school programs." The President and Vice President proposed $200 million
       for after-school programs in their FY99 budget. While the House Republican budget did not
       fund $140 million of the President's and Vice President's request, which would have denied
and Vice President's initiative, which will serve a quarter of a million children each year.

Expanded Head Start. President Clinton proposed a $313 million increase for Head Start
to add 30,000 to 36,000 new slots for children, continuing on the path to serving one million
children by 2002. The House Republican budget did not provide the President's increase
and would have denied up to 25,000 children Head Start slots if enacted. The final budget
includes the President's full increase for Head Start, which is funded at $4.660 billion.

Summer Jobs Protected for Half a Million Youth. While House Republicans attempted to
eliminate the successful Summer Jobs program, President Clinton prevailed with his request
for $871 million in funding, which will finance up to 530,000 summer jobs for disadvantaged
youth.

Expanded Educational Technology -- Connecting Our Children to the Future. President
Clinton's and Vice President Gore's budget requested $721 million -- a $137 million increase
-- for educational technology to ensure that every child has access to computers, the Internet,
high-quality educational software, and teachers that can use technology effectively in the
classroom. The House Republican denied the President's and Vice President's request for a
funding increase, cutting funding $43 million below last year. The final agreement includes
$698 million -- a 20-percent increase over the $584 million funding level in FY98, including
the new $75 million initiative for training new teachers and $10 million for new grants to
pUblic-private partnerships in low-income communities to provide residents access to
computer facilities for educational and employment purposes. Education technology has
always been a top priority for the President and Vice President; since 1993, they have created
the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund and increased overall investments in educational
technology by thirty-fold, from $23 million to $698 million this year.

Protected Goals 2000 to Promote High Academic Standards. President Clinton created
Goals 2000 in 1993 to promote high academic standards for all students and proposed a
modest expansion in this year's budget. While the House Republican budget tried to cut the
program in half, the final budget includes $491 million which will help all 50 States continue
raise academic standards and help at least 12,000 schools implement innovative and effective
education reforms.

Improved Child Care Quality. In his State ofthe Union, the President proposed an
historic child care initiative to make child care better, safer and more affordable for
America's working families. While the budget does not include critical investments in
subsidies and tax credits to help working families pay for child care, it does include the
President's request of $182 million to improve the quality of child care.

Expanded Work Study To Help Nearly One Million Students Work Their Way
Through College. President Clinton's FY99 budget included a significant expansion of the
Federal Work Study program. The final budget agreement provides $870 million -- a $40
million increase over the FY 1998 level of $830 million -- which will allow nearly one
million students to work their way through college and keeps us on track to the President's
goal of one million students in work study by the year 2000.

Expanded Job Training To Help 666,000 Dislocated Workers. President Clinton's

       House froze job training funds for dislocated workers, the final agreement includes $1.4
       billion which will help some 666,000 dislocated workers get the training and reemployment
       services they need to retum to work as quickly as possible. This represents an increase of
       $55 million -- to help 27,000 dislocated workers -- compared to FY98. Since 1993,
       dislocated worker funding has been expanded by 171 percent -- helping to well more than
       double the number of workers served.

       Expanded Charter Schools to Promote Creation High-Quality Public Schools.
       President Clinton's FY99 budget included $100 million for Charter Schools to keep us on
       track toward the President's goal of creating 3,000 high-quality public charter schools that
       will educate more than half a million students by early in the next century. Charter schools
       are public schools started by teachers, parents and communities, that are given flexibility in
       decision-making, in exchange for high levels of accountability for results. The final budget
       provides $100 million -- the President's 25-percent increase -- for Charter Schools and will
       give parents and students more choice, better schools, and greater accountability for results in
       public education.

       Assistance to Help Over 400,000 More Students in Distressed Communities Learn Basic
       Skills. President Clinton proposed a $392 million increase in Title I funding to help
       students in high poverty communities receive the extra help they need to master the basics to
       reach high academic standards. The House Republican budget proposed a freeze in Title I
       funding. The final budget provides a $301 million increase, from $7.375 billion in FY98 to
       $7.676 billion in FY99. This funding will support educational services for nearly 11 million
       students, over 400,000 more than last year.

       Largest Maximum Pell Grant Award Ever. Last year, President Clinton signed into law
       the largest one-year increase in Pell Grant scholarships in 20 years. This year, the final
       budget provides $7.7 billion for Pell Grants, an increase of$359 million over FY98,
       increasing the maximum Pell Grant award from $3,000 to $3,125 -- that's the largest
       maximum award ever, 36-percent higher than it was in 1994. This year, approximately 4
       million students will receive Pell Grant awards.

       Extends Trade Adjustment Assistance (T AA). President Clinton proposed extending
       TAA and NAFfA-TAA in his FY99 budget in order to provide training and income
       support to workers adversely impacted by trade. The final budget extends these
       important programs through June 30, 1999.

Moves Forward On The Environment
In the final budget, President Clinton won important increases to combat water pollution, protect
national parks and other precious lands, restore salmon and other endangered species, and develop
clean energy technologies. At the same time, President Clinton forced Congress to drop
special-interest riders that would have cut roads through wilderness, forced overcutting on our
national forests, crippled wildlife protections, and blocked common-sense actions to address global
warmmg.

       Clean, Safe Water for America. The final budget provides $1.7 billion -- an additional
       $230 million or 16-percent increase from last year -- for the President's Clean Water Action.
       Plan, a five-year initiative to help communities and farmers clean up the almost 40 percent of
                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                  4               Hex-JJwl1j,l Conversion
     budget provides states $2.15 billion in financing for clean water construction projects.
     Preserving Precious Lands. An additional $325 million for FY99 -- a $55 million increase
     from last year -- through the Land and Water Conservation Fund will be used to acquire
     dozens of natural and historic sites around the country, including critical winter range for
     Yellowstone bison, New Mexico's Baca Ranch and the last remaining private stretches ofthe
     Appalachian Trail.

     Protecting Endangered Species. The final budget provides an additional $32 million in
     FY99 -- a 23-percent increase from last year -- providing funds for protection and recovery of
     endangered and threatened species, as well as enhancements for important habitats.

     Leading the Fight Against Global Warming. The final budget provides over $1 billion--
     a 26-percent increase from last year -- to support research investments that will reduce
     greenhouse gas emissions, oil consumption, and energy costs for consumers and businesses
     by promoting in~reased energy efficiency and clean energy technologies.

     Defending Our Environment Against Stealth Attacks. President Clinton forced
     Congress to drop special-interest riders that would have rolled back hard-won environmental
     protections. Anti-environmental language in the budget bills would have:

            Forced overcutting of timber on national forests and accelerated logging of Alaskan
            rain forest.

            Allowed intrusive helicopter landings in Alaska wilderness and the first road ever
            carved through a designated wilderness area.

            Hindered salmon restoration in the Pacific Northwest, and allowed harmful
            commercial fishing in wilderness waters of Glacier Bay National Park.

            Blocked common-sense actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and barred the
            Administration from informing the public about the threat of global warming.

            Placed restrictions on the use of brownfields funds that would have denied
            municipalities the funds they need to undertake clean-up at brownfield sites.

Responds to the Farm Crisis at Home...
     Emergency Farm Assistance. President Clinton vetoed the Agriculture Appropriations bill
     on October 8th "because it fails to address adequately the crisis now gripping our Nation's
     farm community." The final budget includes a significant increase in total emergency
     assistance to fanners and ranchers compared to the bill the President vetoed -- about $6
     billion in the final budget versus $4.2 billion in the vetoed bill, that's 40 percent more
     assistance than the bill the President vetoed. The final bill increased the amount for crop
     loss compensation by_$228 million, and increased the amount for economic loss
     compensation by $1.4 billion, bringing the amounts for these to $2.6 billion and about
     $3 billion, respectively.

                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

      Full IMF Funding To Help Address International Financial Crisis. With America's
      fiscal house in order, the United States is now the bulwark of economic stability in the world.
       Some other nations around the world, however, are experiencing major economic upheaval,
      hurting our exports, farmers, and ranchers. A strong International Monetary Fund is a
      stabilizing force in the world economy and is a critical piece of President Clinton's strategy
      to protect the international financial system -- and therefore the U.S. economy -- against the
      risk of new, escalating, or spreading crises. President Clinton fought for and won full
      funding of$17.9 billion for the IMP -- a critical part of his strategy to help address the global
      financial crisis and to keep our economy strong. A stronger IMF will give the U.S. and its
      allies new flexibility in developing responses to protect the world from the spread of the
      financial crisis.

      Fully Funds President Clinton's Child Labor Initiative. In his State ofthe Union
      address, the President pledged to send legislation to Congress to fight abusive child lallor and
      proposed making the United States the world leader in supporting programs to reduce
      abusive child labor, with a lO-fold increase in our commitment to the International
      Programme for the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC), from $3 million to $30 million a
      year. While the Senate, with the strong leadership of Senator Harkin, fully funded the
      President's request, the House failed to do so, providing only $6 million. In the final
      budget, Congress agreed to the President's full request of$30 million for IPEC. The
      budget also fully funds the President's $9 million request for domestic enforcement and
      a migrant youth job-training demonstration.

Moves People from Welfare to Work and Empowers Communities
President Clinton and Vice President Gore are committed to tapping the potential of
America's urban and rural communities. This budget moves forward on their vision to help
revitalize America's communities:

      50,000 Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers. President Clinton's FY 1999 Budget
      included $283 million for 50,000 new vouchers exclusively for people who need housing
      assistance to make the transition from welfare to work. The original House bill
      included $100 million, while the Senate provided only $40 million. The final budget
      includes President Clinton's full request of $283 million for 50,000 welfare-to-work
      housing vouchers.

      Flexible Funding for Empowerment Zones. President Clinton and Vice President Gore
      requested mandatory funding for second-round urban and rural Empowerment Zones. The
      final budget includes $60 million in this flexible discretionary funding for the next round of
      Empowerment Zones and 20 new rural Enterprise Communities.

      Extended Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit. This tax credit encourages employers to hire,
      invest in training, and retain long-term welfare recipients. The credit is for 35 percent
      of the first $10,000 in wages in the first year of employment and 50 percent of the first
      $10,000 in the second year. President Clinton proposed to extend the credit in his
      FY99 budget and the final budget includes an extension through June 30, 1999.
                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                  6              HeX-Dun·.., COilvmion
requested a major expansion of the CDFI program to continue building a national network of
community development banks. The original House bill froze CDFI funding at $80 million,
while the Senate cut funding to $55 million. The final budget increases CDFI funding from
$80 million in FY98 to $95 million in FY99 -- a 19-percent increase.

Public Housing Reform. This legislation makes the President's landmark housing reform
a reality. This bipartisan bill will allow more economic integration and deconcentration in
our Nation's public housing, encourage and reward work, provide protections for those most
in need, and put the Nation back into the housing business with the first new housing
vouchers in five years.

FHA Loan Limit Increased. President Clinton's FY99 budget included an increase in the
FHA loan limit to expand homeownership opportunities to more Americans. The final
budget includes an increase in the FHA loan limit, raising the limit from $86,317 to
$109,032 in the lowest cost areas and from $170,300 to $197,621 in the highest cost areas.

Extended Work Opportunity Tax Credit. This tax credit encourages employers to
hire individuals who have traditionally had a hard time securing employment.
Targeted groups include disadvantaged youth, including those living in empowerment
zones and enterprise communities, welfare recipients, and qualified veterans. The
maximum credit paid to the employer is as much as 40 percent of an individual's first
$6,000 in wages. The President proposed to extend this credit in his FY99 budget and
the final budget includes an extension through June 30, 1999.

"Play-by-the-Rules" Homeownership Initiative. President Clinton's FY99 budget
included $25 million for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation to start the
"Play-by-the-Rules" homeownership initiative, which would make homeownership more
accessible to 10,000 families who have good rental histories, but are not adequately served in
the housing market. The final budget includes $25 million for this new initiative.

Increased Funding for Homeless Assistance. The President proposed a major expansion
ofHUD's continuum of care program, designed to help homeless persons obtain health care,
jobs, and permanent housing. The final budget includes $975 million in funds for the
homeless -- a $152 million, or 18 percent, increase over last year.

HUD Fair Housing. The President proposed a major expansion ofHUD's Fair Housing
programs, as part of his "One America" initiative. The final budget expands HUD's Fair
Housing programs from $30 million in FY98 to $40 million in FY99. That 33-percent
increase includes $7.5 million for a new audit-based enforcement initiative proposed by the
Administration.

Regional Opportunity Counseling. The Administration requested funds to help counsel
Section 8 certificate and voucher holders on their full range of housing options. While the
Senate did not include any funding for this initiative, the final budget includes $10 million
for this voluntary effort to expand the housing and employment opportunities available to
low-income families.
                                                                  Automated Records \fanagement System

       million and the Senate provided $40 million, the final budget includes $42.5 million -- an
       increase of over 20 percent.

       Cleaning Up Brownfields. The Administration proposed $91 million for EPA's
       brownfield activities, such as grants for site assessment and community planning. The final
       budget includes the President's request of $91 million.

       Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Expansion. President Clinton's FY99
       budget included an expansion ofCDBG. The final budget increases funding for CDBG
       from $4.675 billion in FY98 to $4.750 billion in FY99 -- that's a $75 million expansion this
       year.

       Increased Help For Communities Suffering From Sudden and Severe Economic
       Dislocation. President Clinton's FY99 budget included a 10-percent increase in funds for
       EDA so that they can better respond to sudden and severe economic dislocation. The final
       budget increases funding for EDA from $361 million to $393 million -- that's a 9-percent
       expansion this year.

       Expansion of NADBank. The Administration proposed providing the North American
       Development Bank's (NADBank) Community Adjustment and Investment Program $37
       million of paid-in capital, which would allow the Bank to leverage private capital markets to
       provide additional financing to trade-affected communities. The final budget includes $10
       million of paid-in capital for the NADBank.

       $75 Million for Welfare-to-Work Transportation Funds. While the House and Senate
       provided $50 million -- the minimum amount "guaranteed" in the transportation bill -- the
       final budget includes $75 million for this competitive grant program. These funds will
       assist states and localities in developing flexible transportation alternatives, such as van
       services, to help former welfare recipients and other low income workers get to work.

       Individual Development Accounts. Since 1992, President Clinton has supported the
       creation of Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) to empower individuals to save for a
       first home, post-secondary education, or to start a new business. Congress recently passed
       legislation authorizing IDAs, and the final budget includes $10 million to get this program
       offthe ground.

       Heating and Cooling Assistance for Low-Income Families Protected. More than five
       million low-income families receive help to pay for home heating costs through this
       program, yet the House Republicans tried to eliminate it. The final budget includes the
       President's full request for funding to help low-income families pay for home heating and
       cooling assistance.

Advances a Strong Health and Technology Research Agenda
For six years in a row, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have proposed substantial
increases in the Federal government's research and development portfolio to build a healthier, more

                                                  8                   Automated Records Management System

prosperous, and productive future. In FY 1999, the President proposed, within the first balanced
budget in a generation, the largest commitment to key civilian research in the history of our country
as part of the "Research Fund for America." Congress agreed to support significant increases in
R&D, including:

       Expansion of National Science Foundation. President Clinton proposed a major
       expansion of research and development funds for the National Science Foundation (NSF).
       The final budget includes a 7-percent increase -- from $3.4 billion in FY98 to $3.7 billion in
       FY99 -- in the NSF research budget to support science and engineering research across all
       fields and disciplines. NSF supports nearly half of the non-medical basic research
       conducted at universities.

       Expansion of National Institutes of Health for Biomedical Research. President Clinton's
       FY99 budget included the largest-ever dollar increase in funds for the National Institutes of
       Health (NIH). The final budget includes almost $2 billion expansion ofNlH research
       funding -- a 14-percent increase. Scientists are on the cusp of important new breakthroughs
       in biomedical research, which could revolutionize the way medical experts understand, treat,
       and prevent some of our most devastating diseases. This increase will enable scientists to
       pursue a wide range of cutting edge research from Alzheimers to AIDS to genetic discoveries.


       Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. President Clinton proposed to extend the
       research tax credit because it provides incentives for private sector investment in
       research and innovation that can help increase America's economic competitiveness and
       enhance U.S. productivity. The final budget extends this research tax credit until June
       30,1999.

       Expansion of Energy Department Science Budget. President Clinton's FY99 included an
       8 percent increase in the Department of Energy's science budget, including support for the
       National Spallation Neutron Source. The final budget fully funds the President's request.

       Funds Next Generation Internet. In his State of the Union address, President Clinton
       said, "I ask Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet... And the
       next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to a thousand times faster than today."
       The final budget includes more than $100 million funding for the Next Generation Internet, a
       Federal R&D initiative which will connect more than 100 universities at speeds that are up to
       1,000 times faster than today's Internet, and establish the foundation for the networks and
       applications (e.g. telemedicine, distance learning) of the 21st century.

       Expansion in Advanced Technology Program (ATP). President Clinton's FY99 budget
       proposed an expansion of ATP to promote cutting-edge high-technology projects. While the
       Senate froze funding at the FY98 level and the House cut funding by $13 million, the final
       budget increases ATP funding to $204 million -- an $11 million increase over last year --
       which will allow for about $70 million in new awards to develop high-risk technologies that
       promise significant commercial payoffs and widespread economic benefits.

U     New Efforts to Prevent and Treat HIV/AIDS. The Congress has responded to the President's
      and Vice President's request to substantially increase efforts to prevent and treat HIV/ AIDS.
      Congress has provided $1.4 billion for Ryan White Care Act activities. This funding level
      includes a 61-percent increase for the AIDS drug assistance program, which provides funds
      to States to help uninsured and underinsured people with life-saving treatments for
      HIV/AIDS. In addition, Congress provided about $630 million for HIV prevention
      activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

U     Historic $130 Million Effort to Address HIV/AIDS in Minority Community. Minority
      communities make up the fastest growing portion of the HIV/AIDS caseload (44 percent of
      all new HIV cases). In FY99, there will be an unprecedented $130 million investment,
      including that will improve prevention efforts in high-risk communities, and expand access to
      cutting edge HIV therapies and other treatment needed for HIV/AIDS.

U      Critical New Investments to Protect Public Health at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
      The Congress has responded to President Clinton's request for a $2.4 billion investment -- a
      $222 million increase -- in public health at the CDG This critical investment will address a
      host of public health challenges, including fighting emerging infectious diseases, combating
      new resistance to anti-biotics, and improving prevention for some of our nation's leading
      killers, such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and heart disease.

U     New Efforts to Improve the Quality of Health Care. Congress has responded to the
      President's request for a $25 million investment in new research at the Agency of Health
      Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to research on the quality, costs, and outcomes of the
      health care delivery system. Identifying critical health care problems llnd educating health
      plans, medical professionals, patients, and advocates about solutions can lead to important
      improvements in the quality of health care.

U     Increasing Funding to Provide Health Insurance to Low-Income Children in Puerto
      Rico and the Territories. Thousands of uninsured children in both Puerto Rico and
      the other territories will now be eligible for meaningful health care coverage for the
      first time under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The territories
      were currently on schedule to receive an inadequate and inequitable $10.7 million in
      FY99. Today, the Congress responded to the President's request and provided the
      territories with an additional $32 million in FY99 for their new CHIP programs that
      will meet the needs of their uninsured children.

U     Funding the President's Commitment to Eliminate Racial Health Disparities.
      Minorities suffer from higher rates for a number of critical diseases. For example, African
      Americans under the age of 65 have twice the rate of heart disease as whites, and Native
      Americans suffer from diabetes at nearly three times the average rate. The Congress has
      taken a critical first step in investing in the President's multi-year proposal to eliminate racial
      health disparities in six health areas, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, and

    communities to develop new strategies to address these disparities and has granted the
    President's request for increases in other critical public health programs, such as heart
    disease and diabetes prevention at CDC, that have proven effective in attacking these
    disparities.

U   Lead Poisoning Prevention. The President requested a $25 million increase in funding
    for HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control, in order to reduce the threat posed by
    childhood lead poisoning and other housing-related environmental health hazards.
    While the Senate did not provide any additional funding, the final budget includes a
    $20 million increase for lead poisoning prevention.


Other Highlights ...
    Reduces Backlog and Expands Alternative Dispute Resolution at Equal Employment
    Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The President's FY99 budget included $279 million
    -- a $37 million increase over the previous year -- to significantly expand EEOC's alternative
    dispute resolution program and reduce the backlog of private sector discrimination
    complaints. The final budget fully funds the President's request -- providing the first real
    increase for EEOC in several years.

    President Clinton's Food Safety Initiative. The final budget provided approximately $79
    million in new funds for the President's Food Safety Initiative to help implement a
    far-ranging plan to improve surveillance of food borne illnesses, education about proper food
    handling, research, and inspection of imported and domestic foods. The new funds are part
    of an Administration-wide effort, led by the Department of Agriculture and the Department
    of Health and Human Services, to create a seamless, science-based food safety system.

    More Police on the Streets. In 1994, President Clinton fought for and won a commitment
    to put 100,000 police officers on the street. The final budget includes funds for 17,000
    additional Community Oriented Police Services (COPS) Program police officers toward the
    President's goal of 100,000 cops on the beat by 2000.

    Increasing Law Enforcement in Indian Country. The final bill includes $20 million in
    FY99 for more police officers and public safety initiatives in the approximately 56
    million acres of Indian lands serving more than 1.4 million residents.

    Brings Financial Stability to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The final budget
    includes $50 million that will allow TVA to better provide for the citizens of the seven
    states -- Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and
    Virginia -- that it serves. The agreement will let TVA refinance part of its debt to
    compensate for the loss of Federal funds for its non-power programs. The final
    budget also prevents TVA from losing the Land Between the Lakes Recreation Area.

             DESPITE ALL THE PROGRESS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET,
                  THERE Is STILL MUCH WORK LEFT TO Do

    In the waning days of the session, the President and Congressional Democrats prevailed in
    making critical investments in advancing the President's agenda. However, much work remains
    for the future because Republicans in Congress killed, at least for now, critical priorities,
    including:

    JC     School Modernization Tax Credits. Beginning with his State of the Union address, the
           President fought all year to modernize our schools. His fully paid for tax credits would
           have leveraged nearly $22 billion in bonds to build and renovate schools. In the final
           days of the budget negotiations, Republicans in Congress refused to even meet on the
           critical issue of school construction.

           Patients Bill of Rights. President Clinton repeatedly urged the Congress to pass a
           strong, enforceable patients' bill of rights that would assure Americans the quality health
           care they need. Congressional Republicans killed this year's effort to pass a Patients Bill
           of Rights.

    JC     Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation. This year, President Clinton made passage of
           legislation to reduce youth smoking a top priority, in order to stop kids from smoking
           before they start through a significant price increase, measures to prevent tobacco
           companies from marketing to children, and critical public health prevention and
           education programs. Congressional Republicans opted to act as politicians instead of
           parents, and killed this year's effort to pass bipartisan comprehensive tobacco legislation
           to reduce youth smoking.

    JC     Campaign Finance Reform. At the beginning of the year, the President made passage of
           bipartisan, comprehensive campaign finance reform a priority for his Administration. After
           months of delay, the House of Representatives overcame defenders ofthe status quo and
           passed the Shays-Meehan bill. However, the Senate Republicans killed this historic
           legislation.

           Child Care Initiative. In his State of the Union, the President proposed an historic
           child care initiative to make child care better, safer and more affordable for America's
           working families. The President's proposal included $7.5 billion over 5 years for child
           care subsidies for low-income working families and tax credits to help 3 million working
           families pay for child care. The Republicans refused to support these critical
           investments.

          Speeding Toxic Cleanups. President Clinton called for an additional $650 million -- a
          40 percent increase -- to accelerate Superfund cleanups with a goal of completing a total
          of 900 cleanups by 2001. The Republican majority refused these funds, threatening to
          delay cleanup at up to 171 sites across the country.
    JC    Work Incentives Bill for People with Disabilities. At the commemoration of the
                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion




              Americans with Disabilities Act last July, the President endorsed the bipartisan
              Jeffords-Kennedy bill that enables people with disabilities to go back to work by
              providing an option to buy into Medicaid and Medicare, as well as other pro-work
              initiatives. This bill was on the list of top Administration priorities in the final
              budget negotiations, but rejected by Republicans. The President will continue to
              fight to give people with disabilities the opportunity to work --including the critical
              health insurance that makes work possible.

              Education Opportunity Zones. President Clinton, in his budget, called for Education
              Opportunity Zones to help high-poverty urban and rural communities increase student
              achievement by raising standards, improving teaching, ending social promotions, and
              turning around failing schools. The Republican majority refused to provide the
              requested $200 million in funds, which would have helped about 50 high-poverty,
              low-achieving, urban and rural school districts.

         JC   Minimum Wage. President Clinton and Congressional Democrats called for a $1
              increase in the minimum wage over two years -- to raise the wages of 12 million workers.
               For someone who works full-time, this minimum wage increase would have meant
              an additional $2,000 per year. However, 95 percent of Senate Republicans voted to
              kill the President's minimum wage increase.

              Medicare Buy-In. President Clinton proposed providing new options for
              Americans ages 55 to 65 to obtain health insurance, including buying into Medicare.
               This policy would not have hurt the Medicare Trust Fund. The Republican
              majority killed this new initiative that would have helped provide health care to
              hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Americans.
