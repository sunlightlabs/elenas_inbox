    PRESIDENT CLINTON UNVEILS NEW EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM AT THE 17th ANNUAL
      LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIREFIGHTERS

Today, President Clinton addressed the International Association of Firefighters and announced new steps
and highlighted our continuing efforts to provide firefighters and other first responders the tools they need to
help defend against terrorist attacking using chemical and biological weapons, including: investing an
additional $11 million this year in new, rapid medical response teams trained to respond to a biological or
chemical weapons emergency; awarding $21 million in grants to help communities training firefighters and
other emergency personnel to respond to bioterrorist attacks; and providing $73.5 filion to communities
purchasing protective gear and specialized communications equipment for first responders, such as
emergency medical personnel, policemen, and firefighters. This announcement provides additional detail on
the President's FY 2000 budget proposals, which provide $1.4 billion for weapons of mass destruction
preparedness programs.

THE THREAT OF TERRORIST ATTACKS USING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUcnON
America's unrivaled military superiority means that potential enemies are more likely to resCU'to terror rather
than conventional military assault. Adversaries may be tempted to use the deliberate release of chemical or
biological agents to target our cities and citizens. The development of new technology makes it easier than
ever before for terrorist to produce and disseminate information about agents that can potentially be used in
a bioterrorist attack.

STRONG NEW EFFORTS TO HELP FIRST RESPONDERS COMBAT CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL
TERRORISM
Today, the President announced new steps and highlighted Olr continuing efforts to combat the threat of a
chemical or biological terrorist attack, including:

       Investing an additional $11 million in Metropolitan Medical Response Systems in FY 1999.Today, the
        President will announce that the Department of Health and Human Services plans to invest an
        additional $11 million in FY 1999 in new rapid medical response teams trained to respond to a
        biological or chemical weapons emergency. The Metropolitan Medical Response Systems enhance
        local HAZMAT and emergency response systems by providing onsite victim extraction, antidote
        administration, decontamination, primary care, emergency medical transportation, and hospital based
        medical care and crisis counseling. This new allocation of funding inreases the current FY 1999
        funding level by almost 400 percent, and will support the development of teams in an additional 12
        cities. Today's action takes a significant step towards the Administration's goal of establishing these
        teams in the most densely populated metropolitan areas nationwide.

       Providing fU{1ds to train emergency personnel to respond to chemical and biological terrorist attacksThis
        month, the Department of Justice will award the first funds from their $21 millio initiative to
        combat weapons of mass destruction, designed to help states and local communities train local
        emergency response personnel (including firefighters) about how to respond to bioterrorist and
        other terrorist attacks. This program provides $16million to train emergency response personnel
        about how to respond to a chemical or biological weapons attack. An additional $5 million is
        provided to local communities to support chemical and biological weapons awareness training.

       Funds available to help communities purchase new protective equipment for emergency response
        personnel during a chemical or biological terrorist attack. In April, the Department of Justice will
        make $69.5 million available through grants to States and municipalities to procure personal
        protective equipment, as well as chemicaljbiologicaljradiological agent detection, decontamination,
        and communications equipment to be used in the event of a terrorist attack. An additional $4 millin
                       Hex-Dump ConversJon
     will be used to address the critical communications needs of first responders, including firefighters
     and other emergency services personnel, in the field.

BUILDS ON THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S STRONG COMMITMENT TO PREPARING FOR A
CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS ArrACK

    Safeguarding our citizens from the threat of deadly weapons.The President's FY 2000 budget makes a
     significant investment in new programs to combat unconventional threats. The $1.4 billion dedicated
     to weapons of mass destruction preparedness includes the dedication of an additional $40 million in
     research and development funding for new vaccines and other therapeutics, including smallpox and
     anthrax, for eventual use in the national medical stockpile; a 23 perent increase in funding for
     improvements in the public health surveillance system, including funding for a network of regional
     labs to provide rapid analysis of select biological agents, and $16 million to develop Metropolitan
     Medical Response Systems, medcal teams who respond to biological and chemical weapons
     emergencies, in 25 additional cities.

    Training over 15,000 firemen and other first responders in 52 cities. The Department of Defense has
     trained over 15,000 firemen and other first responders in 52 cities to respond effectively to
     bioterrorist and chemical weapons attacks. The Pentagon also expects to train first responders in 16
     more cities before the end of FY 1999. The President's FY 2000 budget invests an additional!>31.4
     million to fund these training activities in an additional 20 cities.

    Providing funds to train firefighters and other first responders in their communitiesThis year, the
     Federal Emergency Management Agency will spend $4million to help States enhance the ability of
     fire departments and other agencies providing emergency services to respond to a terrorist attack. In
     addition, FEMA will also provide $8 million to States for terrorism related training exercises and
     planning activities.

    Soliciting input from stakeholders and working with communities to improve domestic preparednessIn
     August 1998, the Attorney General met with firefighters, emergency rescue and HAZMAT experts,
     emergency medical seIVices personnel, public health providers, law enforcement, and local
     emergency managers, who urged the Administration to establish a "one stop shopping" network to
     improve domestic preparedness for terrorist attacks. In response to their concerns, the Admiistration
     annouced plans for the National Domestic Preparedness Office in October 1998, which coordinates
     Federal, state, and local activities to ensure the effective use of the resources dedicated to our national
     security.

    Leadership from the top. Last May, President Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 62,
     which defines the Administration's policies on weapons of mass destruction preparedness and
     defenses against other unconventional threats. At that time, he also deignated the first National
     Coordinator to bring together the Federal government's various programs on unconventional threats.
     Soon the President asked for, and recieved, a special budget amendment to begin increasing funding
     for programs to combat biologiml terrorism. In January, the President announced that his budget
     calls for over $10 billion in counterterrorism and related programs, including about $1.4 billion for
     weapons of mass destruction programs.

I.    PURPOSE

      To thank the International Association of Fire Fighters for their support, and commend
      them for their bravery, loyalty, and dedication to public service.

      You will also announce new efforts to provide firefighters and other first responders the
      tools they need to help defend against terrorist attacking using chemical and biological
      weapons, including: new investments in rapid medical response teams trained to respond
      to a biological or chemical weapons emergency; awarding grants to help communities
      training firefighters and other emergency personnel to respond to bioterrorist attacks; and
      providing funds communities purchasing protective gear and specialized communications
      equipment for first responders, such as emergency medical personnel, policemen, and
      firefighters.

II.   BACKGROUND

      The International Association of Firefighters

      You will address over 700 participants in the 17th Annual Legislative Conference of the
      International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). IAFF represents more than 225,000
      professional career fire fighters and emergency medical personnel. In addition, the
      association represents state employees (such as the California Forestry fire fighters),
      federal workers (such as fire fighters on military installations), and fire and emergency
      medical workers employed at certain industrial facilities. It is affiliated with the
      AFL-CIO and the Canadian Labor Congress. IAFF members protect more than 85
      percent of the lives and property in the United States, and are the largest providers of
                Hex-Dump Conversion

pre-hospital emergency care in the U.S. Since its founding in 1918, the IAFF has
worked to: create important fire fighting health and safety regulations; enact federal
benefits for survivors of fire fighters killed or totally disabled in the line of duty; enhance
public safety through national standards; improve the levels of training and education for
fire and emergency personnel; and establish training programs for hazardous materials
emergencies.
