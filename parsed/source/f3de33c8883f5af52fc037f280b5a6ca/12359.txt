4/21/99               CLINTON-GORE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
                           REFORMING WELFARE

          On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and
          Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, fulfilling his longtime commitment to 'end
          welfare as we know it. ' As the President said upon signing, "... this legislation
          provides an historic opportunity to end welfare as we know it and transform our
          broken welfare system by promoting the fundamental values of work,
          responsibility, and family. "


                    TRANSFORMING THE BROKEN WELFARE SYSTEM

         Overhauling the Welfare System with the Personal Responsibility Act: In 1996, the
          President signed a bipartisan welfare plan that is dramatically changing the nation's
          welfare system into one that requires work in exchange for time-limited assistance. The
          law contains strong work requirements, performance bonuses to reward states for moving
          welfare recipients into jobs and reducing illegitimacy, state maintenance of effort
          requirements, comprehensive child support enforcement, and supports for families
          moving from welfare to work -- including increased funding for child care. State
          strategies are making a real difference in the success of welfare reform, specifically in
          job placement, child care and transportation. In April 1999, the President unveiled
          landmark new welfare regulations that will promote work and help those who have left
          the rolls to succeed in the workforce and stay off welfare.

         Law Builds on the Administration's Welfare Reform Strategy: Even before the
          Personal Responsibility Act became law, many states were well on their way to changing
          their welfare programs to jobs programs. By granting federal waivers, the Clinton
          Administration allowed 43 states -- more than all previous Administrations combined --
          to require work, time-limit assistance, make work pay, improve child support
          enforcement, or encourage parental responsibility. The vast majority of states have
          chosen to build on their welfare demonstration projects approved by the Administration.

         Welfare Rolls Decline as More Recipients go to Work: In April 1999, the President
          released state-by-state data (from December 1998) showing that welfare caseloads are at
          their lowest level in 30 years and that the welfare rolls have fallen by nearly half since he
          took office. Since January 1993, 29 states have had caseload declines of more than half
          and nationwide the rolls have fallen by 46 percent, from 14.1 million to 7.6 million.
          This historic decline occurred in response to the Administration's grants of federal
          waivers to 43 states, the provisions ofthe new welfare reform law, and the strong
          economy. Information released by the Department of Health and Human Services also
          shows that the percentage of welfare recipients working has tripled since 1992, that an
          estimated 1.5 million people who were on welfare in 1997 were working in 1998, and
          that all states met the first overall work participation rates required under the welfare
                      Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
                 MOVING PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

   Mobilizing the Business Community: At the President's urging, the Welfare-lo-Work
    Partnership was launched in May 1997 to lead the national business effort to hire people
    from the welfare rolls. The Partnership began with 105 participating businesses, and in
    his 1999 State ofthe Union address, the President announced that the Partnership has
    grown to over lO,OOO businesses. Since 1997, these businesses have hired over 4lO,000
    welfare recipients, surpassing the challenge the President set in May of 1998. The
    Partnership provides technical assistance and support to businesses around the country,
    including: its toll-free number 1-888-USA-JOB1, a web site, a quarterly newsletter, and a
    "Blueprint for Business" hiring manual. The Partnership also published "The Road to
    Retention," a report of companies that have found higher retention rates for former
    welfare recipients than for other new hires, and strategies they used to achieve this
    success.

   Connecting Small Businesses with New Workers: The Small Business Administration
    is addressing the unique and vital role of small businesses who employ over one-half of
    the private workforce, by helping small businesses throughout the country connect with
    job training organizations and job-ready welfare recipients. In addition, SBA provides
    training and assistance to welfare recipients who wish to start their own businesses.
    SBA provides assistance to businesses through its 1-800-U-ASK-SBA number, as well
    through its network of small business and women's business centers, one-stop capital
    shops, district offices, and its website.

   Mobilizing Civic, Religious and Non-profit Groups: Vice President Gore created the
    Welfare-to-Work Coalition to Sustain Success, a coalition of national civic, service, and
    faith-based groups committed to helping former welfare recipients succeed in the
    workforce. Working in partnership with public agencies and employers, Coalition
    members provide mentoring, job training, child care, transportation, and other support to
    help these new workers with the transition to self sufficiency. Charter members of the
    Coalition include: Alpha Kappa Alpha, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Baptist
    Joint Committee, Goodwill, Salvation Army, the United Way, Women's Missionary
    Union, the YMCA, the YWCA, and other civic and faith-based groups.

   Doing Our Fair Share with the Federal Government's Hiring Initiative: Under the
    Clinton/Gore Administration, the federal workforce is the smallest it has been in thirty
    years. Yet, this Administration also believes that the federal government, as the nation's
    largest employer, must lead by example. In March 1997, the President asked the Vice
    President to oversee the federal government's hiring initiative in which federal agencies
    committed to directly hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients in the nexl four years. In
    April 1999, the President announced that the federal government has hired 12,000 welfare
    recipients, meeting the goal nearly two years ahead of schedule. As a part of this effort,
    the White House pledged to hire six welfare recipients and has already exceeded this
    goal.

   Funds to Help Move More People from Welfare to Work: Because of the President's
    leadership, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act included $3 billion for Welfare-to-Work grants
    to help states and local communities move long-term welfare recipients, and certain
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
    non-custodial parents, into lasting, unsubsidized jobs. These funds can be used for job
    creation, job placement and job retention efforts, including wage subsidies to private
    employers and other critical post-employment support services. The Department of
    Labor provides oversight, but most of the dollars are placed through the Private Industry
    Councils, in the hands of the localities who are on the front lines of the welfare reform
    effort. In addition, 25 percent of the funds are awarded by the Department of Labor on a
    competitive basis to support innovative welfare-to-work projects. The President
    announced the first round of 49 competitive grants in May, and the Vice President
    announced the second round of75 competitive grants in November 1998. In January
    1999, the Department of Labor announced the availability of $240 million in competitive
    grants for FY 1999. These funds will support innovative local welfare-to-work strategies
    for noncustodial parents, individuals with limited English proficiency, disabilities,
    substance abuse problems, or a history of domestic violence.

    The President's FY 2000 Budget requests $1 billion to extend the Welfare-to-Work
    program to help 200,000 long-term welfare recipients and noncustodial parents in
    high-poverty areas move into lasting unsubsidized employment. The initiative would
    provide at least $150 million: to ensure that every state helps fathers fulfill their
    responsibilities by working, paying child support, and playing a responsible part in their
    children's lives. Under this proposal, states and communities would use a minimum of
    20 percent of their formula funds to provide job placement and job retention assistance to
    low-income fathers who sign personal responsibility contracts committing them to work
    and pay child support. This effort would further increase child support collections,
    which have risen 80 percent since the President took office, from $8 billion in 1992 to
    $14.4 billion in 1998. Remaining funds will go toward assisting long-term welfare
    recipients with the greatest barriers to employment to move into lasting jobs. The
    reauthorized program also would double the Welfare-to-Work funding available for
    tribes.

   Tax Credits for Employers: The Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit, enacted in the 1997
    Balanced Budget Act, provides a credit equal to 35 percent of the first $10,000 in wages
    in the first year of employment, and 50 percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the second
    year, to encourage the hiring and retention oflong term welfare recipients. This credit
    complements the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides a credit of up to $2,400
    for the first year of wages for eight groups of job seekers. The Omnibus Budget Act of
    1998 included an extension through June 30, 1999 and the President's FY 2000 Budget
    proposes to extend both credits for an additional year.

   Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers: In 1999, the President proposed and Congress
    approved $283 million for 50,000 new housing vouchers for welfare recipients who need
    housing assistance to get or keep ajob. Families will use these welfare-to-work housing
    vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable
    housing that will eliminate emergencies which keep them from getting to work every day
    on time. Nearly all of these vouchers will be awarded to communities on a competitive
    basis, to communities that create cooperative efforts among their housing, welfare and
    employment agencies. The President's FY 2000 Budget provides $430 million for
    75,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers, including $144 million in new funds for
    25,000 additional vouchers.
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
   Welfare-to-Work Transportation: One of the biggest barriers facing people who move
    from welfare to work -- in cities and in rural areas -- is finding transportation to jobs,
    training programs and child care centers. Few welfare recipients own cars. Existing
    mass transit does not provide adequate links to many suburban jobs at all, or within a
    reasonable commute time. In addition, many jobs require evening or weekend hours
    that are poorly served by existing transit routes. To help those on welfare get to work,
    President Clinton proposed a $100 million a year welfare-to-work transportation plan as
    part of his IS TEA reauthorization bill. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st
    Century (TEA-21) authorized $750 million over five years for the President's Job Access
    initiative and reverse commute grants. Of this amount, $50 million is guaranteed
    funding in FY 1999, rising to $150 million in 2003. The Omnibus Budget Act included
    $75 million for this program in FY 1999 and the Department of Transportation is
    currently reviewing applications for this first year funding. The President's Budget
    proposes to double funding for FY 2000, bringing the program to the authorized level of
    $150 million. The Job Access competitive grants will assist states and localities in
    developing flexible transportation alternatives, such as van services, for welfare recipients
    and other low income workers.

   Investing for the Future: In 1992, the President proposed to establish Individual
    Development Accounts (IDAs) to empower low-income families to save for a first home,
    post-secondary education, or to start a new business. The 1996 welfare reform law
    authorized the use of welfare block grants to create IDAs. And last year, the President
    signed legislation creating a five-year demonstration program. Households that are
    either eligible for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or qualify for the Earned
    Income Tax Credit and have a net worth below $10,000 are eligible to participate in the
    demonstration. The FY 1999 budget includes $10 million to launch this initiative, and
    the President has proposed to double the commitment to $20 million in FY 2000.


    PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TO LOW-INCOME WORKING FAMILIES

   Health Care for Low-income Families Who Work: In August 1998, the President
    eliminated a vestige of the old welfare system by allowing all states to provide Medicaid
    coverage to working, two-parent families who meet State income eligibility requirements.
     Under the old regulations, adults in two-parent families who worked more than 100
    hours per month could not receive Medicaid regardless of their income level. Because
    the same restrictions did not apply to single-parent families, these regulations created
    disincentives to marriage and full-time work. Prior to eliminating the rule entirely, the
    Administration allowed a number of states to waive this rule. The new regulation
    eliminates this requirement for all States, providing health coverage for more than
    130,000 working families to help them stay employed and off welfare.

   Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA): TMA provides time-limited Medicaid
    coverage to low-income households whose earnings or child support would otherwise
    make them ineligible for welfare-related Medicaid under state income eligibility
    standards. The President's FY 2000 Budget would reduce burdensome reporting
    requirements, including TMA eligibility procedures in the current Medicaid eligibility
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
    redetennination process. The budget also exempts those states that have expanded
    Medicaid coverage to families with incomes up to 185 percent ofthe federal poverty level
    from burdensome_TMA reporting requirements, providing states with additional
    incentives to provide critical health care services.

   Helping States Help Low-Income Families: In March 1999, the Administration released
    new guidance encouraging States to reach out to children and families who are no longer
    eligible for cash assistance but are still eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. It also establishes
    that states must provide Medicaid applications upon request and process them without
    delay. The guidance reiterates state responsibilities to establish and maintain Medicaid
    eligibility for families and children affected by welfare refonn, and provides creative
    examples of the best way to liberalize eligibility.


                    PROMOTING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

    Increasing Parental Responsibility and Enforcing Child Support: Tougher measures
     under the Clinton Administration resulted in a record $14.4 billion in child support
     collections in 1998, an increase of $6.4 billion, or 80 percent since 1992. Not only are
     collections up, but the number offamilies that are actually receiving child support has
     also increased. In 1997, the number of child support cases with collections rose to 4.2
     million, an increase of 48 percent from 2.8 million in 1992.
    ~        A new collection system, proposed by the President in 1994 and enacted as part of
     the 1996 welfare refonn law, has located over 1.2 million delinquent parents in its first
     nine months of operation. With approximately one-third of all child support cases
     involving parents living in different states, this National Directory of New Hires helps
     track parents across state lines.
    ~        In June 1998, the President signed the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, a law
    based on his 1996 proposal for tougher penalties for parents who repeatedly fail to
    support children living in another state or who flee across state lines to avoid supporting
    them.
    ~        Paternity establishment, often the crucial first step in child support cases, has
     dramatically increased, due in large part to the in-hospital voluntary paternity
    establishment program begun in 1994 by the Clinton Administration. In 1997, the
    number of paternities established or acknowledged rose to a record 1.3 million, two and a
    halftimes the 1992 figure of512,000.
    ~        Finally, President Clinton has taken executive action, including: collections from
     federal payments such as income tax refunds and employee salaries, and steps to deny
     federal loans to delinquent parents. The federal government collected over $1.1 billion
    in delinquent child support from federal income tax refunds for tax year 1997, a 70
    percent increase since 1992.

   Breaking the Cycle of Dependency -- Preventing Teen Pregnancy: Significant
    components of the President's comprehensive effort to reduce teen pregnancy became law
    when the President signed the 1996 Personal Responsibility Act. The law requires
    unmarried minor parents to stay in school and live at home or in a supervised setting;
    encourages "second chance homes" to provide teen parents with the skills and support
    they need; and, provides $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education
                                                                    .   ~~mf)ConvelSion

    actlVltIes. Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has supported innovative and
    promising teen pregnancy prevention strategies, including working with boys and young
    men on pregnancy prevention strategies. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen
    Pregnancy, a private nonprofit organization, was formed in response to the President's
    1996 State of the Union. In 1997, the President announced the National Strategy to
    Prevent Teen Pregnancy. The first annual report on this Strategy reported that
    HHS-supported programs already reach at least 31 percent or 1,470 communities in the
    United States. Notably, data shows we are making progress in reducing teen pregnancy
    -- teen births have fallen six years in a row, by 15 percent from 1991 to 1997. And,
    teen pregnancy rates are at their lowest level in 20 years.
                                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

                RESTORING FAIRNESS AND PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE

     The President made a commitment to fix several provisions in the welfare reform law that had
     nothing to do with moving people from welfare to work. In 1997, the President fought for and
     ultimately was successful in ensuring that the Balanced Budget Act protects the most vulnerable.
       In 1998, the President continued his proposals to reverse unfair cuts in benefits to legal
     immigrants. The Administration's FY 2000 budget would build on this progress by restoring
     important disability, health, and nutrition benefits to additional categories oflegal immigrants, at
     a cost of $1.3 billion over five years.

           Disability and Health: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Noncitizen Technical
            Amendment Act of 1998 invested $11.5 billion to restore disability and health benefits to
            380,000 legal immigrants who were in this country before welfare reform became law
            (August 22, 1996). The President's FY 2000 Budget would restore eligibility for SSI
            and Medicaid to legal immigrants who enter the country after that date if they have been
            in the United States for five years and become disabled after entering the United States.
            This proposal would cost approximately $930 million and assist an estimated 54,000
            legal immigrants by 2004, about half of whom would be elderly.

           Nutritional Assistance: The Agricultural Research Act of 1998 provided Food Stamps
            for 225,000 legal immigrant children, senior citizens, and people with disabilities who
            enter the United States by August 22, 1996. The President's FY 2000 Budget would
            extend this provision by allowing legal immigrants in the United States on August 22,
            1996 who subsequently reach age 65 to be eligible for Food Stamps at cost of $60
            million, restoring benefits to about 20,000 elderly legal immigrants by 2004 ..

           Health Care for Children and Pregnant Women: Under current law, states have the
            option to provide health coverage to immigrant children and pregnant women who
            entered the country before August 22, 1996. The President's FY 2000 Budget gives
            states the option to extend Medicaid or CHIP coverage to low-income legal immigrant
            children and Medicaid to pregnant women who entered the country after August 22,
            1996. The proposal would cost $325 million and provide critical health insurance to
            approximately 55,000 children and 23,000 women by FY 2004. This proposal would
            reduce the number of high-risk pregnancies, ensure healthier children, and lower the cost
            of emergency Medicaid deliveries.

          Helping People Who Want to Work but Can't Find a Job: The Balanced Budget Act, as
           amended by the Agricultural Research Act, also restored $1.3 billion in food stamp cuts.
           The welfare reform law restricts food stamps to 3 out of every 36 months for able-bodied
           childless adults, unless they were working. Acknowledging that finding a job often takes
           time, the BBA provided funds for work slots and food stamp benefits to help those who
           are willing to work but, through no fault of their own, have not yet found employment.
           In addition, the BBA allows states to exempt up to 15 percent of the food stamp recipients
           (70,000 individuals monthly) who would otherwise be denied benefits as a result of the "3
           in 36" limit.
