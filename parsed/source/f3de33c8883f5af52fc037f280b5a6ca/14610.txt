       WHITE HOUSE PROPOSED LANGUAGE ON REASONABLE EFFORTS
                       ADOPTION 2002 REPORT


      Clarifying "Reasonable Efforts": (d) A proposal to clarify the "reasonable efforts"
       requirement and other law as it relates to permanency and safely;

PROPOSED ACTION STEPS

To ensure the protection of children by clarifying or proposing changes to legislation regarding
"reasonable efforts," reunification of children with their families, and termination of parental
rights:

      The Department will issue administrative guidance within 60 days that clarifies the
       "reasonable efforts" provision of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. This clarification
       will advance the goal of giving every child in our nation's public child welfare system a
       safe and pennanent home by making it clear that in determining whether and when to
       remove a child from his or her family, whether and when to reunify the family, and
       whether and when to seek an alternative pennanency plan, the child's health and safety
       shall be the paramount concern.

      Members of Congress have developed a number of proposals to address this issue, and
       the Department will work with them to achieve statutory changes reinforcing this
       administrative clarification.

      The Department in particular will work with Congress to more clearly and appropriately
       define the circumstances in which "reasonable efforts" to reunify a family should not be
       undertaken. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended by
       Congress in 1996, already requires that, as a condition for receiving funds under the Basic
       State Grant Program:

       1)     the State may not mandate the reunification of a surviving child with parents
              found to have aided, abetted or committed:

              --murder
              --voluntary manslaughter
              --serious bodily injury to their children; and

       2)     conviction of any of the above mentioned felonies constitutes grounds for the
              termination of parental rights.

       The Department will work towards amending the Title IV-E provision of the Social
       Security Act by incorporating an expanded version of this list of circumstances in which
       reunification is not appropriate.

           The Department will also issue model guidelines for State legislation that will advance
            the goal of giving every child in our nation's public child welfare system a safe and
            pennanent home by making it clear that in determining whether and when to tenninate
            parental rights, the child's health and safety should be the paramount concern.

     DISCUSSION

     Since 1980, Federal law has required that "reasonable efforts" be made both: 1) to prevent the
     unnecessary removal of children from their families; and 2) to reunify children, when possible,
     who have been placed in foster care, with their families. The goal of this provision was to
     reduce the phenomenon of children languishing unnecessarily in foster care. The Federal
     "reasonable efforts" requirement has been both heralded as being essential to effective child
     welfare practice and criticized for being unclear and a barrier to child safety and permanence.

     Consultation with the field revealed that there is wide variation in how current "reasonable
     efforts" law is interpreted by caseworkers, agencies, and judges around the country. There was a
     strong consensus that some clarification of the reasonable efforts requirements is needed to allow
     for better, more timely decision making in individual cases, although there were divergent
     opinions on what degree of specificity would be useful from the Federal government.

     The proposals outlined above will send a clear message that Federal law requires that the health
     and safety of children shall be the paramount concern in making decisions about whether and
     when to remove children from families, whether and when to reunify the families, and whether
     and when to seek alternative permanency plans. They also will make clear to the States the
     Administration's view that the child's health and safety should be paramount in determining
     whether and when to terminate parental rights.
