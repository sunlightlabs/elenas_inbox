MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

THROUGH:              SYLVIA MATHEWS AND BRUCE REED

FROM:                 STEVE SILVERMAN
                      DIANA FORTUNA
                      BIBB HUBBARD

DATE:                 October 17, 1997

CC:                   ANN LEWIS AND THURGOOD MARSHALL

This is to update you on Administration progress in the six months since the Philadelphia service
summit and to provide a strategy for the next six months. Attached you will find 1) a review of
your accomplishments to date; and 2) a six month proactive strategy.

The six month anniversary is October 27, and we expect continuing press attention in the coming
weeks. General Powell and America's Promise (the non-profit organization continuing the
summit's work) will commemorate the six-month anniversary by releasing an "Update to the
Nation" on November 25, perhaps at the National Press Club. Prime Time Live will interview
Powell about the anniversary. Jonathan Alter of Newsweek is working on a comprehensive
update that is expected to be influential.

Contrary to reports in this week's Time and Sunday'S Boston Globe, you and the Administration
have made significant progress since the event in Philadelphia. You have highlighted the
summit's five goals for children in several speeches; you have followed through on your major
announcement on AmeriCorps scholarships; you have announced a variety of policy initiatives
that relate directly to the summit's goals; and Cabinet agencies have begun to follow through on
their commitments. The Corporation for National Service is very actively involved in summit
follow-up work, as Harris Wofford travels the country to participate in and plan dozens of
follow-up summits.

Although America's Promise has not yet been able to develop measures of the summit's success,
your work at the summit has clearly contributed to a spirit of service and volunteerism that is
developing every day in communities around the country. And, while challenges of this
magnitude are not without difficulties (e.g., organizational difficulties at America's Promise,
cynical media, heightened expectations, and measurement questions), you and the Administration
have every right to be proud. By any measure, you have effectively follow-up on your service
commitments and will continue to do so.
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

After a bumpy start, America's Promise appears to be moving toward a stable organizational
structure. This week, Peter Gallagher became the third CEO of America's Promise, replacing
Ray Chambers, who remains very involved. Gregg Petersmeyer, who ran President Bush's
volunteer office, manages the communities team, and Tim Hanlon, a former advisor to President
Bush, handles Communications. They manage a staff of 50-60 that continues to grow.

As you have noted, it is critical for the Administration to connect our on-going policy initiatives
to service and to the summit's five goals for children wherever possible (i.e., America Reads,
children's health, welfare to work, racial reconciliation, education technology). Moreover, real
progress has been made on projects directly related to service, including AmeriCorps
Scholarships, high school service scholarships, and cabinet agency summit commitment
implementation.

We should remain proactive over the next six months, continuing to demonstrate the
Administration's commitment to service through Presidential speeches, several events,
participation in mini-summits, agency commitment follow-up, new policies related to service and
children, and direct service program enhancement. As set forth here, your record of
accomplishment on service is profound. In the coming weeks, we will ensure that all interested
media and constituencies are briefed about your record.

Administration Accomplishments Since the Presidents' Service Summit

President Clinton is deeply committed to the goals of the Presidents' Summit for America's
Future held in Philadelphia last April. Service and the well-being of our nation's children
have been at the center of the President's agenda since he took office.

The President is committed to moving forward with America's Promise and other partners
to attain the summit's goals for children --a caring adult, a safe place, a healthy start, a
marketable skill, and a chance to serve. Since April, the President has continued. to
emphasize the importance of service to audiences, including the Business Roundtable, the
Conference of Mayors, the Welfare-to-Work Partnership, and the radio address, and has
recognized major corporate commitments. At the same time, the Administration has been
moving forward on all five goals.

The Spirit and Work ofthe Summit Continues
Since the summit, America's Promise and the Corporation for National Service have
continued the work that began at the summit --working with communities at the
grass-roots level and securing commitments from corporate and non-profit America
toward the five goals. America's Promise, the independent organization founded to follow
up on the summit, has garnered over 200 new commitments since the summit, some very
substantial. Over 150 cities and states are holding "mini-summits" around the country,
with the help of America's Promise and the Corporation for National Service. America's
Promise is encouraging communities to become "communities of promise" that take
responsibility for reaching children at risk. The President has met with General Powell to
discuss progress since April and talk about future directions.

The President's Corporation for National Service is also helping corporations and
non-profits implement their summit commitments at the local level. Viacom is deploying
its employee volunteers through AmeriCorps. The Corporation's Learn and Serve
America program is helping in the delivery of eye exams and glasses to over 40,000 needy
children promised by Vision Service Plan. The Corporation's National Senior Service
Corps is helping the National Education Association-Retired meet its commitment to
deploy thousands of retired teachers as tutors for America Reads. AmeriCorps*VIST A is
working with IBM to bring technology to community organizations.

The Administration is Moving Ahead on the Summit's Goals
Since April, we have continued our work on the summit's five goals. Several of the
following initiatives were announced at the summit itself by the President or by federal
agencies.

AmeriCorps Scholarships:
We have increased opportunities for young people to serve their communities. At the
summit, the President issued a challenge to service and religious organizations that we
would provide 50,000 new AmeriCorps scholarships over the next 5 years to organizations
                                           . Hex-Dump Conversion
that offer young people the chance to serve. The response since then has far exceeded our
expectations. Seventy-seven organizations answered that challenge, offering to sponsor
10,000 new AmeriCorps members. In June, 8,900 scholarships were approved, well ahead
of our first-year plan for 5,000 scholarships. (Summit goal 5, among others.)

National Service Scholars:
This summer, we launched a new effort to recognize and foster outstanding community
service among our nation's youth. We awarded scholarships to over 1,600 high school
students with exemplary service records in the first year of the National Service Scholars
program. A host of leading community organizations stepped forward to raise the local·
match for the scholarships, including the Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions, Veterans of Foreign
Wars, the American Legion, Elks, and Women's Clubs. Each high school principal was
invited to nominate a junior or senior for the scholarship. For next year, we have secured
funding that will allow the program to expand to 10,000 high schools --almost half of all
high schools in the nation. (Summit goal 5.)

Children's Health:
The Balanced Budget Act included a huge investment of $24 billion in children's health
care, the single largest investment in health care for children since 1965. This Children's
Health Initiative will give many more children the "healthy start" that the Summit
recognized as so important. In June, the President announced that Kaiser Permanente is
committing $100 million to provide health coverage for uninsured children in California,
complementing the Administration's efforts. The Administration is also focusing on outreach
to families who may not know their children are eligible for Medicaid or other health
insurance. (Summit goal 3.)

Welfare to Work:
Since May, the Vice President has been leading the Coalition to Sustain Success, a new
partnership of civic organizations that is working with state and local government to
mentor families seeking to leave welfare for work and provide them with networking and
support. In addition, the Welfare to Work Partnership has mobilized over 2,500
businesses to hire welfare recipients, so that those parents can move into the economic
mainstream and improve their children's future. The Partnership is helping companies all
across the nation hire people off welfare by providing information on best practices through a
Blueprint for Business and other information available on their toll-free hotline and web page, as
well as working closely with community and business leaders in a number of cities to promote
innovative and effective welfare to work initiatives. (Several summit goals.)

Loan-Forgiveness for Community Service:
The President's proposal for loan forgiveness for those who perform community service
was enacted as part of the balanced budget. To encourage private universities and
non-profit organizations to offer loan forgiveness to borrowers who take lower-paying
service jobs, the President proposed and won a provision that would not subject such loan
forgiveness to taxation. (Summit goal 5.)
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

America Reads and AmeriCorps:
The Department of Education and the Corporation for National Service have begun to
implement the President's America Reads initiative this year, while seeking resources from
Congress for full-scale implementation in 1998-99. Hundreds of colleges and universities
have committed to provide tens of thousands of work-study students as reading tutors in
the current school year as part of America Reads, the national literacy campaign to ensure that
every child can read well and independently by the third grade.
AmeriCorps members are working in 94 programs across the country to tutor and mentor,
set up after-school and summer programs, and recruit parents and community volunteers
as tutors. ,The Corp.oration is also launching a new "Seniors in Schools" initiative in nine
cities to use older volunteers as literacy tutors in some of the nation's poorest elementary
schools. In the District of Columbia, over 1,000 college students, volunteers, seniors, and
parents will tutor f"trst grade children in 16 of the neediest schools in the city. (Summit
goal 4.)

White House Conference on Child Care:
On October 23, the President and First Lady will host this event as part of an
Administration focus on how to ensure high quality and affordable child care.       This
effort builds on our earlier emphasis on the importance of early learning. (Summit goals
1,2, and 4.)

Commitments by Federal Agencies:
Federal agencies are following through on the more than 40 commitments they made at the
summit, including mentoring and tutoring and launching new partnerships with
corporations and nonprof"tts. They are also continuing to launch new initiatives and
partnerships to reach the summit's goals. Here are some examples of agency progress:

          Department of Justice: The Department of Justice has convened a new
          public/private Mentoring Alliance to promote the Summit's mentoring goal,
          disseminate information about best practices, and determine how best to link
          volunteers with the children who need them. Members inclu!ie Big
          Brothers/Big Sisters, One to One, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and Save
          the Children. In addition, DOJ has followed through on its commitment to
          more than double the number of sites for its Juvenile Mentoring Program.
          (Summit goal 1.)

          DOJ also completed its commitment to expand its Drug Education for Youth
          (DEFY) summer camp program that promotes positive life choices for
          children between the ages of 9 and 12. After the summer program, the
          children are linked with mentors from the local U.S. Attorney's off"tce, police
          department, or university. DOJ's new Youth Network provides a forum for
          young people and community organizations to exchange ideas on juvenile
          violence and delinquency prevention. (Summit goals 1 and 2.)

          Corporation for National Service: The Corporation for National Service is
                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

taking the lead to meet the Summit's goal of engaging an additional 2 million
young people in community service. (Summit goal 5.) It is also developing
a new initiative "To Learn and Grow" to expand and improve the quality of
afterschool programs (Summit goal 2).

Department of Education:         This summer, the summer reading program
Read*Write*Now! reached over 1.5 million children through over 500,000
reading partners, fulfilling the Department's commitment. (Summit goal 4.)

Health and Human Services: In June, HHS Secretary Shalala launched a
new partnership with the Girl Scouts, to teach girls about the dangers of
substance abuse and other risky behaviors, featuring a new patch that Girl
Scouts can earn by completing the program. (Summit goals 1 and 3.)

Department of Defense: The Army has modified its leave policy to make ~t
easier for military and civilian personnel to volunteer in schools. Pursuant
to its commitment, the Department of Defense is increasing high school
enroUment in Junior ROTC Career Academies, an alternative to the regular
high school JROTC program designed to address the special needs of at-risk
youth. (Summit goals 1,2, and 4.)

Department of Agriculture:      In September, the Vice President and
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman convened a National Summit on Food
Recovery, to develop a national strategy to increase gleaning efforts by
one-third by the year 2000. (Summit goal 5.)

Department of Transportation: DOT has launched its new effort, the Garrett
A. Morgan Technology & Transportation Futures Program. To date, DOT
has heard from over 200 partners who want to join its effort to reach one
million students by the year 2000. The program will offer these students
better math, science, and technology skills and information about careers in
technology and transportation. (Summit goal 4.)

Partnerships with Schools: The Social Security Administration, the
Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and
the Department of Transportation are among the agencies now forging new
partnerships with schools. (Summit goals 1 and 4.)
                                                            Hex-Dwnp Conversion

THE NEXT SIX MONTHS

We should remain proactive over the next six months, continuing to demonstrate the
Administration's commitment to service through Presidential speeches, several events,
mini-summit participation, agency commitment follow-up,· service-relate policy
development and direct service program enhancement. As set forth here, your record of
accomplishment on service is profound. Between now and October 26, we will work to
ensure that all appropriate media and constituencies are briefed about your record.

SIX MONTH STRATEGY ON SERVICE INITIATIVES

We should remain proactive over the next six months, continuing to demonstrate the
Administration's commitment to service through Presidential speeches, several events,
mini-summit participation, agency commitment follow-up, service-related policy
development and direct service program enhancement.

There are a number of promising opportunities for events and announcements that will
allow us to show significant progress by next April, one year after the Summit.

I.     Six-Month Anniversary October 26-28
America's Promise is now planning to downplay the six-month anniversary because
much of their empirical and anecdotal evidence is not ready for release yet. So, rather
than hold a press conference at the National Press Club and release a report, General
Powell will have one interview from Prime Time Live.

In the days leading up to the Summit, we propose briefing all the key reporters on your
accomplishments and developments listed above. Moreover, during the America Reads
event and the OLC speech, you will have a chance to highlight this success.

II.    Participation with America's Promise
We meet regularly with representatives from America's Promise and are working closely
together in order to promote the goals of the Summit -- especially goal five, to serve.
Below are activities at America's Promise that we are involved in.

Mini-Summits:
You, the Vice President, Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Gore should participate in one of the
several hundred mini-summits being held in communities and regions around the country.
 We are working closely with General Powell's staff to determine the most appropriate
summit for you and the other principals -- including your cabinet -- to participate in over
the next six months. Harris Wofford will continue to travel extensively to these
mini-summits. The Corporation for National Service is part of the planning team for
many of the state and local summits.
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

Meeting with General Powell:
You and the Vice President should meet with General Powell again, as you did in July, .
for a briefing on Summit follow-up. White House staff will continue to meet regularly
with America's Promise officials to keep abreast of developments and to keep America's
Promise up to speed on Administration service related activity. In this regard, we should
ask America's Promise to report to you on their progress since the summit. It will be
useful to continue to foster these positive relationships.

America's Promise Video:
On behalf of America's Promise, the John Schreiber Group is producing a television
special to highlight the daily risks facing millions of American children and youth and the
numerous programs, corporations and individuals that have responded through the efforts
of the Summit and America's Promise. The John Schreiber Group has requested photos
of the President for the special. We supplied them with a photo taken at the Summit in
Philadelphia and are waiting for them to send us a copy of the program for counsel's
approval.

III.    Administration Policies with Service Themes
As has been noted, your interest in service did not commence or conclude with the advent
of the Service Summit. Over the years, you have promoted service as a way of life and
as one of your major themes. Your signature program -- AmeriCorps-- is a testament to
that commitment. As we go forward, there are opportunities to continue and enhance the
ongoing service related initiatives and to announce new ones. Below are some thoughts
on possible next steps towards promoting community service.

Children's Health Outreach:
We are working with states and community groups to ensure that eligible children are
emolled in Medicaid and the new child health program. Through America's Promise,
we could ask all the organizations that made commitments to the summit to embark on a
major effort to reach these children. Gen. Powell has been interested in this issue.

Work Study:
We could push college presidents to convert a greater portion of college work-study jobs
into community service. Jonathan Alter of Newsweek is pushing this idea, along with
the notion that colleges should have welfare recipients do the work now done by students
in work-study programs.

Teen Pregnancy and Service~
A new study shows that engaging in community service is at least as effective as other
methods of teen pregnancy prevention. We could design an event with the National
Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and the Corporation for National Service.

Policy Events Focussed on Summit's Goals:
You could appear at one or more event centered on one of the five goals of the summit.
Opportunities are many, and they could include an event with the Department of Justice's
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

new Mentoring Alliance, which is working toward the summit's first goal. Another
option is the launching of the Corporation for National Service's Seniors for Schools:
America Reads initiative, which uses older volunteers as literacy tutors in elementary
schools. The Corporation says such an event could take place in October or November.

President's Initiative on Race:
There is a possibility that the topic of your first town hall on Race in early December will
revolve around service themes. Additionally, we will reach out to America's Promise to
see how we can integrate the goals of the race initiative with the Summit·related activities
taking place in cities and states across the country.

IV.    Service Projects Moving Forward
The Corporation for National Service is making significant progress in pushing goal five
of the Summit and continues to gain national support for AmeriCorps and it's other
important programs. Additionally, within the White House, we are thinking about ways
to promote citizen service nationally.

AmeriCorps:
Harris Wofford has put together a draft legislative proposal to reauthorize the Corporation
for National Service's programs, including AmeriCorps. This would be the first
reauthorization of these programs, which are now operating without authorization.
Ideally, we would like to reauthorize these programs through the end of your term or
beyond. Either through an event or an accompanying letter from you, we could use this
as an opportunity to reflect on the contribution AmeriCorps has made in the past five
years, including its key role in mobilizing volunteers.

It appears that the antipathy toward Corporation programs has lessened significantlY'since
the summit. This year's appropriations battle has not seen an assault on the
Corporation's core programs, as previous years have. The remaining battle is over what
level of funding the Corporation will secure for the America Reads program. We have
asked the Corporation to wait on this proposal until appropriations are finished. Wofford
is pushing hard to send our draft legislation to the Hill before Congress leaves for the
year.

Expansion of High School Service Scholars Program:
Next year we can expand our program of $1,000 scholarships for exemplary high school
service to 10,000 high schools, a significant increase from the 1,700 schools that
participated in the first year of the program. There are approximately 24,000 high
schools in the U.S.. The Corporation for National Service is planning a major
promotional campaign to generate more interest in this program, including getting local
sponsors to provide matching funds. You could send a letter to all high school principals
urging them to become involved and nominate a student from their school.

Mentoring through the Inter-NetIVirtual Reference Desk:
OSTP, in conjunction with Cabinet Affairs, DPC and the Corporation, is promoting this
                                                             Hex.Dump Conversion


initiative. The goal is to allow all qualified and interested individuals to volunteer their,
time to answer the questions of the k·12 community which relate to the federal
government. The project builds on national initiatives of the Administration including a
call for increased volunteerism and community service.

Mentoring Projects:
White House staff and the federal agencies are investigating opportunities to tutor young
people through America Reads, Everybody Wins and other appropriate programs.

The White House Service Web Page:
The Office of Communications, under the direction of Kevin Moran, is developing a
clearinghouse of community service opportunities for White House staff.

Strengthening The Clinton Administration's Commitment to Service Presidential
Memorandum:
Shortly, we expect to recommend an Presidential Memorandum directing federal
departments and agencies to explore additional measures to expand service opportunities
for Federal employees.

Other Service Ideas:
We are continuing to search for .opportunities to highlight citizen service. For example,
there may be opportunities in St. Louis or Sacramento to do a service related event.
Another idea is to have you host a meeting with representatives of companies, volunteer
groups, recipients of mentoring, non·profits and community leaders to get a report from
the field on how things are going. There would support the anecdotal information, like
the story General Powell related to you, about Sioux Falls, South Dakota and the
groundswell that is taking place. This would contrast with the "inside the beltway" view
offered by some reporters.

Reinstate Daily Points of Light Awards:
As yo~ know, Harris Wofford has recommended that we reinstate the Daily Points of
Light Awards .. a high priority for President's Bush. The awards would be generated
jointly from the Corporation for National Service and the Points of Light Foundation.

Martin Luther King Day of Service:
Martin Luther King Day is designated as a day of service .. "a day on, not a day off'.
Rev. King was an advocate of service. You, the Vice President and/or the First Lady
could join some of the service activities planned for that day. .     .
