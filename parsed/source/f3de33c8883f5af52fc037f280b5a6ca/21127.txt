               S. 2334 -- FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING,
                AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
                  (Sponsors: Stevens (R), Alaska; McConnelI (R), Kentucky)


       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on S. 2334,
the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 1999,
as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to accommodate many of the
President's priorities within the limited 302(b) alIocation available, and commends the
Committee for its support of key funding priorities such as the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary investments in
programs funded by this bill. As a result, a number of key programs are seriously under-funded.
 To have an effective foreign policy, a strong national security policy, and to promote continued
economic prosperity, it is essential that additional resources be made available to the
Subcommittee. In addition, there are a number of objectionable restrictions on funding in the
bilI and a significant number of earmarks that, combined with the reduced funding level, would
seriously limit the Administration's ability to conduct foreign policy. For these reasons, if the
bill were presented to the President in its current form, the President's senior advisers would
recommend that he veto the bill. We hope to reach consensus on these issues as the bill moves
forward.

         This legislation is a critical element of America's national security budget. At the dawn
of a new century, America faces unique challenges and unprecedented opportunities to strengthen
our national security, enhance our global leadership, extend the reach of our democratic values,
and deepen our own prosperity. The challenges we face are formidable. If this bill in its
current form were to become law, however, it would erode our ability to promote critical
American interests at home and abroad effectively. The responsibility of safeguarding our
national security and exercising U.S. leadership cannot be secured within the resources available
to the Subcommittee. We urge the Congress to provide the resources needed to keep America
safe, strong, and prosperous.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level for the programs funded
through this bill is to offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas. The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that conform
to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings through user fees and certain mandatory
programs to help finance this spending. In the Transportation E~uity Act Congress --e/mrif System
                                                                   AUtomated Recor<lS'Manag
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We want to work with the Congress on
mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be used to increase funding for
high-priority discretionary programs, including those funded by this bill.

International Monetary Fund

        The Administration welcomes and commends the Committee's efforts to provide funding
for both the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) New Arrangements to Borrow and quota
increase. The Administration believes that the immediate approval of these requests is
necessary to provide the IMF with the resources it needs to protect the international financial
system -- and therefore the U.S. economy -- against the risk of new, escalating, or spreading
crises. As recent events, including the new stabilization program for Russia, clearly
demonstrate, the IMF's need for additional resources grows more urgent by the day.

       The Administration is concerned, however, with some of the provisions of the
Committee-reported bill as currently drafted. The Administration is in agreement with many of
the underlying objectives as policies that the United States should vigorously promote at the IMF
and looks forward to working with the Congress to address these issues in a manner consistent
with our goals.

New Independent States

        As recent events have indicated, the incomplete peaceful transition of the New
Independent States (NIS) to stable, market-based democracies is vital to the U.S. national
security. The Congress has shared this view and provided considerable support for this program
in the past. The current political/economic situation in Russia indicates how great the stakes are
for the United States to continue to help Russia achieve this peaceful transformation. The
enormous economic potential of the Caspian Basin represents great opportunities to advance our
mutual goals. The Administration commends the Committee for providing resources above the
House level. However, the cuts embodied in the Committee's funding level for USAID
assistance programs to the NIS would result in a funding level that is $30 million below the FY
1998 level and $185 million below the request.

         These cuts would make it extremely difficult to push for market reforms and support
democratic forces across the region. Further, the prohibition on all assistance to Russia -- not
just the government -- pending certification of termination of all nuclear reactor and ballistic
missile technology cooperation with Iran, is so rigid as to impede the Administration's ability to
ensure that termination. This would hold programs designed to foster the private sector across
Russia hostage to Government policy in Moscow. In addition, the numerous country earmarks
would make it more difficult for the Administration to shift assistance to take advantage of new
opportunities such as the election of reform-minded governments, peace agreements settling
ethnic disputes, or helping leverage reforms by coordination of our assistance with international
financial institutions. The Administration strongly favors repeal of continued restrictions on
U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan. These restrictions operate as a disincentive to securing peace in


                                                 2                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

Middle East Assistance

        The Administration welcomes the efforts of the Committee to work with us in
encouraging changes in traditional levels of assistance to countries in the Middle East. We
believe that Israel's initiative to reduce Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance provides an
important basis on which to build future assistance programs that meet our needs in the Middle
East and beyond. However, due to the very constrained funding levels for international affairs
programs, the Administration has proposed an accelerated approach to the reduction of Israel's
ESF. We would encourage the Senate to give strong consideration to such an approach as the
bill proceeds through the process.

        We are very concerned about the deletion of current authority to allow the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) to maintain an office in Washington, D.C. This would severely
undermine our ability to facilitate dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians at what is an
extremely sensitive juncture of the peace process. Finally, we favor maintaining a Foreign
Military Financing funding level of $1.3 billion for Egypt in FY 1999.

Export-Import Bank

       The Administration appreciates the Committee's effort to increase the funding for the
Export-Import Bank (Ex-1m Bank) substantially. The funding increase represents a vote of
confidence in the Bank's mission to sustain U.S. jobs and exports that would not otherwise go
forward. However, the bill falls short of the level needed to meet anticipated u.S. exporter
demand in FY 1999.

        The Administration is concerned with the language prohibiting disbursements of Ex-1m
Bank credits to programs or enterprises that are majority owned or managed by State entities.
The Administration wants to promote private sector development in Russia and other NIS
countries. The Administration shares the Committee's goal of supporting private sector
businesses in the region and would like to work with the Committee to develop responses to the
difficult issue of how to work with governments in the transition period from command to free
markets. However, the proposed language would imperil almost $4 billion in u.S. exports tied
to current and probable transactions, provoking substantial litigation and undermining the
credibility of Ex-1m Bank's financing support for u.S. exporters.

        The Administration is opposed to an amendment that may be offered that would require
the Ex-1m Bank to approve transactions that did not conform to its environmental guidelines if a
foreign government offered -- or indicated -- support for the transaction. This "least
common-denominator" amendment could effectively eliminate the guidelines, as virtually every
case involving the guidelines is potentially subject to foreign competition. Both in the 0-8 and
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States has
made real progress in getting other countries to take a serious look at the impact of export credit
financing on the environment. If the Ex-1m Bank's environmental guidelines are eliminated due

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex·Dump Convenion
significantly threatened and progress on these issues would be substantially hindered.

Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR)

        The Administration is concerned with the $46 million, or 21 percent, cut to the $216
million request for NADR, but greatly appreciates the Committee's support for the Korean
Peninsular Energy Development Organization. Unfortunately, the NADR reduction undermines
the multi-prong effort that NADR supports to reduce the proliferation threat to u.S. national and
global security. Lack of funding for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Preparatory
Commission would harm U.S. national security interests as it would eviscerate planned
improvements in our ability to monitor nuclear testing worldwide. The recent Indian and
Pakistani tests are a stark reminder of the importance of this monitoring. As well, we would be
forced to reduce support for demining efforts, NIS science centers, and other related activities.
The Commission and its International Monitoring System should be funded, regardless of
ratification of the CTBT.

Global Environment Facility

        The Administration is concerned with the refusal of the Committee to fully fund the
request for the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which is helping to reduce long-term
environmental risks that will affect all Americans. The full $300 million request for GEF (of
which $192.5 million is for arrears) is needed to assure that GEF does not run out of resources in
FY 1999. Concerns that funding GEF would prejudge debate on the Kyoto Climate Protocol are
misplaced: the new replenishment agreement is funded at the same level as the prior one, and
GEF will continue with precisely the same broad work program that it had prior to Kyoto. The
GEF is among the best vehicles that the U.S. has to encourage developing countries to shoulder
greater responsibility for protecting both the local and global environment. Under the terms of
the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act, the Senate can fully fund the arrearage request without
making reductions to other programs funded in the bill. It is manifestly in our interests to clear
our arrears and keep GEF running, and the Administration strongly urges the Senate to restore
funding for this critical program.

Economic Support Fund

        The Administration is concerned with the overall funding level for the Economic Support
Fund (ESF). At the Committee mark, the Fund would be cut by 50 percent of the funds
necessary to support economic and political stability in Latin America, as well as other emerging
democracies in Africa and Asia. We strongly encourage the Senate to support a higher funding
level for the ESF as the bill moves forward.

        Excessive conditions on aid to Haiti, even with a national security waiver, would
undercut our efforts to achieve a democratic, self-sustaining Haiti with an honest, independent
judiciary.


                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                4                Hex-Dump Conversion

         The Committee has reduced the $83 million request for Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)
by 17 percent. PKO provides vital assistance and support for many important national security
and foreign policy activities, including commitments in Bosnia and Haiti, conflicts in Africa,
and potential trouble spots such as in the Balkans. This reduction would limit the President's
ability to respond to these and other evolving events.

Central and Eastern Europe

         The Administration appreciates the continued support of the Senate for our efforts to
achieve a lasting peace in the Balkans. The assistance programs are essential to meet the goals
of the Dayton agreement, including the ability of refugees and displaced persons to return to their
homes, reintegration of multi-ethnic communities and institutions, and helping the citizens of the
region decide their futures through free and fair elections. The II-percent reduction to the
request for assistance to Bosnia is of concern because it would reduce our ability to react to
unforeseen problems or opportunities. This lack of flexibility could impair our ability to reach
the goals outlined above and, in tum, would pose a potential problem in terms of reducing our
troop levels, a goal shared by the Administration and the Congress. Finally, restrictions in the
bill intended to prevent war criminals from benefitting from U.S. assistance, though
well-intentioned, would prove extremely difficult to administer. We look forward to working
with the Senate to make this language more workable.

        Additional reductions in the assistance program for the rest of the region are problematic
as well. These reductions come at a time when we are working to phase out assistance. FY
1999 is planned to be the last year for new funding in Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia, and the
year in which we planned to begin capitalizing a joint public-private partnership to help sustain
democracy after U.S. bilateral assistance is phased out.

 African Development Fund

        The Administration is deeply concerned with the $150 million cut to the request for the
African Development Fund, which provides resources for the poorest countries in SubSaharan
Africa, including the entire request to fund the annual commitment of$67 million and $83
million in arrears. Funding the request is necessary to support the reform measures underway
for the past three years at the African Development Bank and Fund. The Administration
strongly urges the Senate to restore funding for this critical program.




                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                 5                     . Hex-Dump Conversion

        The Administration is very concerned with the Committee's failure to fund the
Community Adjustment and Investment Program (CAIP), a program initially funded through the
North American Development Bank, a multilateral development bank. The CAIP was
established to help communities affected by adverse trade patterns associated with
implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. To date, the program has
assisted in more than 120 loans in 20 States, leveraging private sector financing of over $70
million. The $37 million requested would significantly bolster CAIP's ability to continue this
work, as well as to support technical assistance, grants, and micro-lending. The Administration
strongly urges the Senate to restore funding for this innovative program.

Asian Development Fund

       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Asian Development
Fund, reflected in the $187 million funding of arrears. Nevertheless, the Committee's mark
excludes the $100 million request to fund our annual commitment to the Asian Development
Fund; thus, it would result in substantial net new arrears to the Fund. The Administration is
committed to clearing up current arrears and to avoiding the creation of new arrears. The Asia
Development Fund has played an important role in addressing the Asian economic crisis. The
Administration strongly urges the Senate to fund the Administration's request of $150 million
towards arrears and $100 million towards the annual commitment.

Peace Corps

        The Administration is deeply concerned with the $49 million cut to the request for the
Peace Corps. This reduction, to a level $5 million below the FY 1998 funding level, would not
only preclude the Peace Corps initiative to fund 10,000 volunteers by the year 2000, but would
require the Peace Corps to reduce costs equivalent to closing six country programs and reducing
the number of volunteers by 500. The Administration strongly encourages the Senate to support
a higher funding level for the Peace Corps.

Treasury Debt Restructuring

        The $25 million funding level for international debt restructuring is inadequate to finance
anticipated debt restructuring for some of the poorest countries in FY 1999, especially debt relief
proposed under the President's new Africa Initiative. The Administration's $72 million request
was made on the basis of debt reduction anticipated for up to 14 countries to receive debt relief
through the Paris Club group of official creditors or through the Africa Initiative's bilateral
concessional debt reduction component. If this $25 million funding level were enacted, the
Administration would be unable to provide debt relief to a number of sub-Saharan African
countries likely to be eligible under the Africa Initiative.



                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                 6              Hex-Dump Conversion

        While the Administration appreciates the Committee's provision (after permitted
transfers) of an amount for USAID Development Assistance very close to the President's request,
we are concerned about the multitude of earmarks, which would make it difficult to fully fund
the shared assistance priorities of the President and Congress in regions such as Africa and Latin
America. In particular, while the Administration is committed to helping Indonesia through its
current economic crisis, we are concerned that the Committee's earmark for Indonesia, by
reducing the President's flexibility, may actually impede our efforts to respond most effectively
to the changing nature of the Asian economic crisis. The Administration is concerned about
new onerous language related to climate change, including additional procedural requirements
and the omission of existing language that provides "notwithstanding" authority for activities
intended to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

International Narcotics Control

       The Administration is deeply concerned about the $53 million reduction to the $275
million request for International Narcotics Control. Such a reduction would negatively impact
country programs, especially in the Andean region, that are aimed at reducing the supply of
cocaine. The reduction would force the redirection of available resources to cocaine producing
countries at the expense of heroin reduction efforts in Southeast Asia.

International Organizations and Programs

        The Committee bill reduces the request for International Organizations and Programs by
$44 million, which would limit significantly u.s. ability to participate and support a number of
international organizations, particularly those involved with global environmental activities.

u.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Operating Expenses

         The Administration appreciates the Committee's effort to provide a small increase above
the FY 1998 enacted level for USAID Operating Expenses. However, we are concerned that
this level will not allow USAID to complete the Year 2000 conversion and implement other
necessary management improvements while implementing the President's initiatives in Africa
and Latin America and effectively managing its ongoing programs, including congressional
priorities in areas such as infectious diseases and child survival. Therefore, we urge the Senate
to provide additional funding for USAID Operating Expenses.

u.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Operating Expenses: Inspector General

       The Administration appreciates the Committee's effort to provide a small increase above
the FY 1998 enacted level for Operating Expenses for the Office of the USAID Inspector
General. However, we are concerned that this level will not provide sufficient funding to allow



                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                7                 Hex·Dump Convmion



    the Inspector General to carry out fully his increased audit responsibilities under the GPRA and
    GMRA while also responding to the increased costs of providing security for USAID in the
    Ronald Reagan Building. ·Therefore, we urge the Senate to provide additional funding for the
    USAID Inspector General.

    U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Credit Programs

            The Administration is concerned that the Committee has reduced the requested subsidy
    amount for the Urban Environment (UE) credit program and has not provided transfer authority
    for USAID's Development Credit Authority (DCA). As the Congress and the Administration
    agreed in the FY 1998 appropriations legislation, US AID has taken substantial steps towards
    developing the capacity to manage both its existing and future credit portfolios. We urge the
    Senate to restore the transfer authority for the DCA and increase funding for the UE program.
    Failure to do so would limit the ability of US AID to use credit to promote development in urban
    areas and to encourage the development of needed private sector financial mechanisms.

    Overseas Private Investment Corporation

            The Administration is pleased the Committee has provided full program funding for the
    Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). However, we are concerned with the
    provision of the bill that would withhold one-half of the agency's administrative budget. The
    Administration is working closely with the Committee to resolve any outstanding issues and
    notes that withholding funds would impede the agency's efforts to support American business
    and promote U.S. foreign policy.

    African Development Foundation

            The Committee has reduced the $14 million request for the African Development
    Foundation (ADF) by 43 percent.· Through its grants program, ADF supports community-based,
    self-help initiatives in Africa. This reduction would severely limit the ability of the Foundation
    to respond to the development needs at the grassroots level in Africa. The Administration urges
    the Senate to fund this program at the requested level.

    Year 2000 Conversion

             The need to conform with Year 2000 (Y2K) conversion requirements mandates the
    additional investments in information technology and credit management that are included in the
    requests for USAID Operating Expenses, Peace Corps, and the other agencies funded in this bill.
     It is essential to make Y2K funding available quickly and flexibly. We appreciate the action of
    the Senate Appropriations Committee to provide an emergency fund in the Treasury/General
    Government bill for such purposes. We urge Congress to leave as much as possible of the
    reserve unallocated so that funds are available to address emerging needs.




                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Rex-Dump Con_on
