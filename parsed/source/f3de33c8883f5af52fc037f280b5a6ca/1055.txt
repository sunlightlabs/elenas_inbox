              A BALANCED BUDGET THAT REFLECTS AMERICA'S VALUES.
              President Clinton's budget demonstrates that we can move the country beyond the
              false choices of the past -- and that we can finish the job of balancing the budget, to
              lower interest rates and keep tpe economy growing, while still investing in key
              priorities such as education that help the American people thrive and our economy
              grow.

A DETAILED PLAN TO BALANCE THE BUDGET IN 5 YEARS.
    Protect and Strengthen Medicare & Medicaid. Extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund well into
     the next century. Protect the fundamental guarantee of health benefits for the disabled, nursing home
     residents, & strengthen health coverage for children.           .
    Invest in Education -- our nation's number 1 priority for preparing for the next century.
    Strengthen environmental protections.
    Build on the Vice-President's efforts to make our government work better and cost less.
    Provide middle-class tax relief to pay for education, health care, to help raise a child and buy and
     sell a home.

BUILD ON PRESIDENT CLINTON'S RECORD ON DEFICIT REDUCTION.
    We have cut the deficit by 63% after it had quadrupled during the previous 12 years.
    We now have a smaller deficit as a share ofGDP than any other major country in the world.
    FY98 budget builds on this progress and reaches balance by 2002 while investing in the future.

MEETING REPUBLICANS HALFWAY ON MEDICARE.

On difficult issues such as Medicare reforms, the President shows that he is serious about reaching a bipartisan
agreement to balance the budget.
    The President's Balanced Budget uses responsible Medicare policies to strengthen the life of the
     Trust Fund without placing unnecessary burdens on beneficiaries. The President's plan achieves
     $100 billion of savings over S years ($138 billion over 6 years) through several reforms including reducing
     reimbursement to managed care. The plan also guarantees the solvency of the Part A trust fund until 2007
     while maintaining choice and the high-quality of Medicare services.

TAX CUTS FOR FAMILIES WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST.

The President's budget provides about $100 billion of tax cuts over the next five years to help families:
          Raise their children ($SOO per child),
          Send them to college ($1 ,SOO HOPE Scholarship and $10,000 tuition tax deduction),
          Save for the future (penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for education and first homes; tax-free
           savings for education through combined use of the tuition tax deduction and education IRA);
          Buy and sell their homes by the exclusion of $500,000 of capital gains on the sale of the home,
          Move from welfare to work with tax incentives to businesses, by allowing employers a SO% credit
           on the first $10,000 of annual wages that they pay to long-term welfare recipients.
          And tax incentives to boost investment in distressed areas and promote hiring of the economically
           disadvantaged.
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
INVESTING IN THE FUTURE. The President's budget maintains our critical priorities by increasing our
investments in health care, education and training, the environment and science and technology. It also
establishes new initiatives important new initiatives to help prepare America for the 21 st century.

     Health Care:
            Helps an estimated 3.3 million families, including 700,000 children, keep their health care
             coverage for up to six months until their breadwinners find new jobs.
            Provides health insurance coverage for millions of children who are uninsured.
            Invests more in the Ryan White AIDS program and in biomedical research at NIH to find
             ways to prevent and treat diseases.
            Establishes a new Alzheimer's respite benefit within Medicare and provides for an annual
             mammogram without copayments.

     Education and Training:
           Increases funding for Head Start by 55%, from $2.8 billion in FY93 to $4.3 billion in FY98.
           Increases GOALS 2000 funding by 26% to help states raise educational achievement.
           Doubles funding to $500 million next year for the Technology Literacy Challenge and a related
             program to help ensure that all children are technology literate by the tum of the century.
           Includes the largest increase in the maximum Pell Grant scholarship in two decades, a $1. 7
             billion increase in aid over FY97, and expanded eligibility for at least 348,000 more students.
           Creates the America Reads Challenge to help insure that all children can read well and
             independently by the end of third grade ($2.75 billion over five years.)
           Creates a $5 billion new school construction fund over four years to spur $20 billion in school
             construction and renovation.

     Environment:
           Funds the Kalamazoo Initiative to protect communities from toxic pollution by the 2000.
           Increases funds for the National Park System to help improve park facilities and further protect
            our national and cultural treasures.

     Crime:
           Funds 17,000 more police, helping to move towards the President's goal of 100,000
          new police by the year 2000.
           Increases funds for the Drug Courts initiative, for drug testing, for the Safe and Drug-Free
            Schools initiative and other programs to fight drugs.
           Funds 7,359 Border Patrol agents -- 85% more than in FY93 -- to control illegal immigration.

A BALANCED BUDGET PLAN THAT CLOSES LOOPHOLES AND SPECIAL INTEREST
PROVISIONS.

To protect priorities like Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment, the President believes we should
also be closing loopholes and special interest provisions.
            The President's budget proposes approximately $34 billion of business tax base broadeners, tax
             loophole closers and tax compliance measures for FY 1998-2002.

LET'S BUILD ON OUR PROGRESS.

We have cut the deficit by 63%. Deficit reduction has reduced interest rates, and spurred strong investment and
the creation of over 11 million new jobs. Now, we must work together to achieve a real and solid balanced
budget that keeps America strong and growing.

                       SUMMARY OF TAX CUTS IN THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET

 $100 BILLION IN TAX CUTS. President Clinton's 1998 budget provides nearly $100 billion of tax cuts
 through FY 2002, including a child credit for middle-income families; tax cuts for education and training;
 expanded IRAs; targeted home-ownership tax cut; and tax incentives to boost investment in distressed areas and
 to promote hiring of the economically disadvantaged.

 MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUTS ($90.8 BILLION). These proposals will help middle-class families pay the
 bills, raise their children, send them to college, upgrade their skills, and save for retirement.
  Tax Credit for Dependent Children ($46.7 billion): Phased-in $500 tax credit for dependent children.
  Education and Training Tax Incentive ($38.6 billion): HOPE Scholarship tax credits of up to $1,500 per
    year, for first two years of post-secondary education; a $10,000 tax deduction for post-secondary education and
    training; income exclusion for forgiveness of certain student loans; and extending the exclusion for
    employer-provided educational assistance, reinstating exclusion for graduate courses, and providing small
    businesses a 10% income tax credit for employee education expenses.
  Expand Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) ($5.5 billion): Double, over time, the income limits on
    deductible IRAs; expand penalty-free withdrawals to cover post-secondary education, unemployment
    expenses, and first-time home purchases; and add new "special" back-loaded IRAs.

 TARGETED HOME-OWNERSHIP TAX CUT ($1.5 BILLION). Allow exclusion of $500,000 ($250,000
 singles) of capital gains from selling a home. This would exempt over 99% of home sales from capital gains
 taxes and dramatically simplify taxes and record-keeping for over 60 million homeowners.

 T AX INCENTIVES FOR DISTRESSED AREAS ($2.4 BILLION)
  "Brownfields" Initiative: Allow immediate expensing of certain costs to encourage firms to clean up
   abandoned, contaminated industrial properties in distressed urban & rural areas.
  Incentives to Empower Communities: Stimulate revitalization of economically distressed urban & rural
   communities by designating 20 additional Empowerment Zones and 80 additional Enterprise Communities,
   providing new tax incentives, additional small business expensing, and new private activity bonds.
  Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Tax Credit: Provide $100 million of credits to be
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
WELFARE-TO-WORK INITIATIVE ($0.6 BILLION). To encourage hiring oflong-term welfare recipients,
provide a new welfare-to-work credit through September 30, 2000. It would allow employers a SO% credit on
the first $10,000 of annual wages that they pay to long-term welfare recipients for up to two years. Also expand
the Work Opportunity Tax Credit to include certain able-bodied adults, ages 18-S0.

SMALL BUSINESS AND FARM ESTATE TAX RELIEF ($0.7 BILLION). To address cash-flow problems
that may arise upon the death of a farmer or small business owner, increase the amount of property eligible for a
favorable interest rate on deferred tax from $1 million to $2.S million.

OTHER INITIATIVES. Extend for one year expiring tax provisions (R&E credit, Work Opportunity Tax
Credit, others) ($2.7 billion). Modify statutes of limitations on tax refunds to treat the disabled fairly ($0.05
billion). Revitalize DC with tax incentives ($0.26 billion) and provide a more efficient and effective tax
incentive for Puerto Rico ($0.417 billion). Allow FSC software benefits for computer software licenses ($0.S6
billion).

President Clinton's balanced budget balances our values and protects our priorities. It achieves $100
billion in real scorable savings over 5 years, places no undue burdens on beneficiaries, modernizes and
improves the program, and extends the life of the Medicare Trust Fund to 2007. This plan meets
Republicans halfway -- and they have responded in a constructive and positive manner. The President
looks fonvard to working with both Congressional Democrats and Republicans in a bipartisan process to
protect Medicare.

The President's plan reforms and improves Medicare by:
            Extending the life of the Medicare Trust Fund to 2007.

            Bringing the program into the 21st century by:
                   =>     Providing more choice by establishing new private health plan options.
                   =>     Establishing market-oriented purchasing for Medicare including new
                          prospective payment systems and competitive bidding authority and centers of
                          excellence to improve quality and cut back on costs.
            Adding Medigap protections to increase the security of Medicare beneficiaries.

The President's plan explicitly:
                   Saves $34 billion by reducing reimbursement to managed care through a phased
                    in reduction in HMO payment rates and an indirect reduction in HMO payments
                    associated with the traditional fee-for-service cuts.

                   Saves $33 billion in hospital expenditures through reductions in hospital
                    updates, capital payments etc.

                   Saves about $14 billion over 5 years through the transition to and
                    establishment of a new prospective payment system and other programmatic
                    changes in reimbursement to home health care.

                   Saves about $7 billion over 5 years through the transition to and establishment
                    of a new prospective payment system and other programmatic changes in
                    reimbursement to nursing home facilities.

                   Saves about $7 billion over 5 years through a modification of physician
                    updates.

                   Saves about $9 billion over 5 years through new provisions to combat fraud
                    and abuse.

                   Saves about $10 billion over 5 years by extending current law that sets the Part
                    B premium at 25% of program costs.

                   Invests $15 billion over 5 years in preventive health care to improve seniors'
                    health status, in establishing a new Alzheimer's respite benefit starting in 1998
                    and in buying down excessive outpatient copayments to the traditional 20%
                    level.

                                      REDUCTION


 CUT THE DEFICIT BY 63 PERCENT. President Clinton has reduced the budget deficit by 63 percent--
  from $290 billion in FY 1992 to $107 billion in FY 1996. [Based on data from OMB, FY 1998 Budget, February 1997.)

 LOWEST DEFICIT SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S. The deficit has fallen from 4.7 percent of GDP in FY
  1992 to 1.4 percent in FY 1996 -- the lowest for any year since 1974. [Based on data from OMB, FY 1998 Budget,
  February 1997.)

 LOWEST DEFICIT OF ANY MAJOR ECONOMY. The total U.S. deficit in 1996 as a percentage of the
  economy was lower than for any other major country. [OECD, Economic Outlook, December 1996.)

 MAKING GOVERNMENT MORE EFFICIENT. Federal employment has fallen by 275,000 from its
  1993 base. Federal employment as a share of total employment is the smallest it has been since the early
  1930's. [Based on data from OMB, FY 1998 Budget, February 1997.)

AS A RESULT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT, ECONOMIC
PERFORMANCE HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY:

      INVESTMENT BOOM. Deficit reduction has lowered interest rates and spurred investment.
       Equipment investment has grown by 10 percent per year under President Clinton -- faster than any
       Administration since John F. Kennedy was President. [Based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis,
       Department of Commerce.)

      EMPLOYMENT BOOM. Since January 1993, the economy has added more than 11 million new jobs
       -- a faster rate of job growth than under any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920's. [Based on
       data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor.)

      THE LOWEST COMBINED RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION SINCE
       JOHNSON. The combined rate of unemployment and inflation has been lower under President Clinton
       than for any Administration since Lyndon Johnson was President. [Based on data from the Bureau of Labor
       Statistics, Department of Labor.)

THE EXPERTS AGREE THAT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN REMARKABLE;

...j   Money Magazine: President Clinton has "presided over the kind of economic progress any
       Republican President would be proud to post." IMoney Magazine, August 19961

        Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve: "It's been a remarkable period of steady
       growth, low inflation and low unemployment." 18/3/961

         Allen Sinai, a leading economic forecaster: "When the history book on this business cycle upturn
       is written, it will go down as the best ever, compared with other post-World War II upturns."

SPENDING IS LOWER TODAY UNDER REAGAN OR BUSH:

    FEDERAL SPENDING WAS LOWER IN 1996 -- AND IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN
     LOWER IN 1997 -- THAN IN ANY YEAR SINCE 1979. Federal outlays as a share ofGDP
     were lower in 1996 than in any year since 1979. And current projections suggest no increase in
     outlays as a percent of GDP during 1997. Outlays under President Clinton have been a smaller
     share of GDP than under Reagan or Bush. [Based on data from OMB, FY 1998 Budget, February 1997.]
    SINCE PASSAGE OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S 1993 DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE,
     EXPECTED GOVERNMENT SPENDING BETWEEN 1993 AND 2002 HAS FALLEN BY
     MORE THAN $1.4 TRILLION. The President's budget will cut net spending by an additional
     $275 billion by 2002 -- for a total spending cut between 1993 and 2002 of more than $1. 7 trillion.
     That's about $25,000 for a family offour. [Based on data from OMB, FY 1998 Budget, February 1997.]

    GROWTH IN TOTAL FEDERAL SPENDING HAS BEEN LOWER UNDER CLINTON
     THAN UNDER REAGAN OR BUSH. Real Federal outlays have grown by 0.7 percent per year
     under President Clinton -- lower than under President Bush (2.6 percent per year) or President
     Reagan (2.6 percent per year). [Based on data from OMB, FY 1998 Budget, February 1997.]

    WHILE MAINTAINING CRUCIAL INVESTMENTS IN PEOPLE, REAL
     DISCRETIONARY SPENDING HAS FALLEN UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON -- A
     BETTER RECORD THAN UNDER REAGAN OR BUSH. Real discretionary outlays have
     fallen by 2.5 percent per year under President Clinton -- lower than under President Bush or
     Reagan. [Based on data from OMB, FY 1998 Budget, February 1997.]

    NON-DEFENSE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IS NOW A SMALLER SHARE OF THE
     ECONOMY THAN IN 8 OF THE 12 YEARS UNDER REAGAN OR BUSH. Non-defense
     discretionary outlays are now lower than in 8 of the 12 Reagan-Bush years. With the President's
     balanced budget plan, non-defense discretionary outlays will fall by 9 percent in real terms between
     1997 and 2002. [Based on data from OMB, FY 1998 Budget, February 1997.]

      THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET ASSUMP1i1~p'Canver! on
     ESTABLISHING A CREDIBLE RECORD OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS

       A RECORD OF CREDIBLE FORECASTS. For the past four years, the Clinton Administration
        has used middle-of-the-road economic forecasts for budgetary purposes. For four years in a row,
        growth has been higher and the deficit has been smaller than we had projected.

       ACTUAL DEFICITS HAVE BEEN SMALLER THAN WE PREDICTED. Between FY 1994
        and FY 1996, the actual deficit has on average been about $50 billion lower than we had
        projected the year before. CBO has been less accurate: their estimates have been off by $59
        billion on average.

       THE 1996 DATA CONFIRM THE CREDIBILITY OF OUR FORECASTS. The most
        recently available economic data confirm the credibility of our forecasts. Our estimates of
        growth and the deficit for 1996 were too cautious -- and turned out to be more accurate than the
        Congressional Budget Office's forecasts.

                      In last year's budget, we projected that real growth during 1996 would be 2.2
                       percent. But the advance GDP data released in February indicate that growth in
                       1996 was 2.5 percent (on a year-over-year basis). While both the Administration's
                       forecast and the CBO's forecast were conservative, ours was more accurate (CBO
                       had predicted 2.0 percent). Over the past four years, our real GDP forecasts have
                       been more accurate than CBO's.

                      The FY 1996 deficit was smaller than we had projected. Our projection for the FY
                       1996 deficit was $170 billion in February 1994 and $197 billion in February 1995.
                       CBO's projections were $177 billion in February 1994 and $211 billion in February
                       1995. The actual deficit was only $107 billion. Again, while both the
                       Administration and CBO forecasts were conservative, ours were more accurate.

       NO MORE ROSY SCENARIOS. As in each of the four years that we have been in office, our
        estimates of growth in 1996 were thus too low and our estimates of the deficit too high --
        confirming that the Clinton Administration does not use rosy scenarios for its budget projections.

       MAINSTREAM PROJECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE. Our forecasts for the next 5 years are
        also mainstream and conservative. For key budgetary variables such as GDP growth (2.2 percent
        per year) and GDP inflation (2.6 percent per year), our assumptions match those of the Blue Chip
