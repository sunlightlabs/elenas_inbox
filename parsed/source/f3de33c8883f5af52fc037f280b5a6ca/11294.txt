TEXT:
I bolded the new part.  Please note   that the NYT story (and possibly
others) are erroneously citing some   of the straw purchaser numbers for
juveniles. The numbers/percentages    relate to investigations, not the
number of guns, and are part of the   performance report released last week,
not the YCGII report.

                                       Question and Answer
                                        February 22, 1999


    Q:   Over the weekend, the Treasury Department released a report on its gun tracing
         efforts. What were the major findings of the report?

    A:   Yesterday, the Treasury Department released its second major report on President
         Clinton's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) in place in 27 cities across the
         nation. Among the report's major findings were:

               Over 25 percent of guns recovered by law enforcement in the 27 cities are moving
                rapidly from retail sale to point of recovery by law enforcement. This short "time
                to crime" suggests that these guns were likely to have been illegally trafficked.

               Over half (51 percent) of the guns used in crimes by juveniles and youths ages
                18-24 were acquired by intermediaries such as straw purchasers acting on behalf
                of the real buyer.

               Over .11 percent of guns used in crime were possessed by juveniles (age 17 and
                under), and over 32 percent were possessed by youths ages 18-24.

               Semi-automatic pistols were predominant among crime guns in each of the 27
                cities, and constitute over half (52 percent) of all trace requests.

               Over one-third of traffickers involved in illegal trafficking investigations had prior
                felony convictions.

         The 27 cities included in the YCGII report are: Atlanta, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston,
         Bridgeport (CT), Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Gary, Houston, Inglewood
         (CA), Jersey City, Los Angeles, Memphis, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New York,
         Philadelphia, Richmond (V A), Salinas (CA), San Antonio, St. Louis, Seattle, Tucson, and
         Washington, DC.

         In addition, a performance report released by the Treasury Department on YCGII
         last week, showed that of ATF's 648 illegal trafficking investigations involving youth
         and juveniles -- 51 percent involved straw purchasers or straw purchaser trafficking
         rings.

         The President's FY 2000 budget includes an additional $11.2 million for YCGlI for more
          tracing and new ATF agents to bolster trafficking investigations-- bringing the total
         funding for this initiative to $45.2 million.
