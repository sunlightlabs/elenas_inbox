                                     Naturalization backlog
                                         July 22, i998
Background:

Many immigration advocates have expressed serious concerns over the naturalization backlog
and INS's naturalization fee increases. The dramatic increase in naturalization applications
(from 540,000 in FY 1994 to almost 1.6 million in FY 1997), along with the dedication of
substantial resources over the past nine months to implement quality procedures, has resulted in
an increase in the number of pending applications to nearly 1.9 million as of the end of May
1998. Currently, most applicants are experiencing a wait time of 18-24 months.

The naturalization program is funded through application fees. The advocates will likely ask for a
one-time allocation of funds to assist with backlog reduction efforts. OMB and DPC are
working with the INS to develop a credible backlog reduction plan that focuses on management
and process reforms. In the meantime, waiting times continue to increase. At the same time,
the INS plans to increase the fees on naturalization from $95 to $225 as of October 1st (this
increase will more accurately reflect the actual cost of processing an applicant). In addition, the
INS recently announced that their anticipated receipts for FY 1999 are down 46%.

Talking points:

      We agree that the growing backlog is unacceptable. The Administration is committed to
       both management reforms and providing the funding necessary to steadily reduce and
       eventually eliminate the backlog.

      Our FY 1999 budget anticipates significantly reducing the waiting time for naturalization
       applicants.

      In addition, the Domestic Policy Council and the Office of Management and Budget are
       working with the INS and Department of Justice to develop a comprehensive and
       effective plan to reduce, and eventually eliminate, the backlog. We are committed to
       achieving this goal.

      In the past year, the INS has implemented several reforms to the naturalization process
       that are designed to expedite processing, while maintaining integrity. Also, as you know,
       the Administration has developed a plan to restructure the INS that will improve
       accountability and allow for better leadership and focus on the services side of the
       operation.

If asked about the fee increase:

      We recognize that in some cases the anticipated fee increase will create a hardship. We
       will make sure that any proposal to increase the fee is accompanied by a waiver for those
       for whom the burden is too much. However, given the budget realities, an increase in
       the fee is the only way to reduce the backlog.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
                                           Public charge
                                           July 22, 1998

 Background

Current immigration law requires the INS and the State Department (consular officers) to
determine whether an applicant for admission to the United States is likely to become a "public
charge." Current practice permits the INS and consular officers to take into consideration
whether the applicant is in receipt of certain public benefits. The State Department has a policy
of excluding consideration of food stamps and WIC, but including consideration of Medicaid,
SSI and TANF. INS has the same general policy, though their practice is to sometimes consider
food stamps. The word has spread within the immigrant community that enrolling yourself or
your children in Medicaid or other benefit programs puts you at risk with the INS.

The DPC and OMB have been leading an inter-agency process to determine whether, given the
increased use of Medicaid and food stamps by working families and children and our increased
efforts to insure that all eligible children and families receive these benefits, the agencies should
revise their policies.

Talking points:

.     Weare concerned about policies or practices that would endanger our efforts to enroll
       eligible children and families in Medicaid and food stamp programs.

      The DPC and OMB have been heading up an inter-agency process to look at this issue.
       We are at the tail end of that process, and hope to reach a clear resolution soon.
