TEXT:
Attached are talking points on the legal immigrant provisions of the Ways
and Means chairman's mark today. We still have no numbers, OMB, on the
impact of the 2nd proposal. Anything you can provide would be
appreciated. I am also talking to SSA about this.

Please give any comments to me AND Cynthia Rice via email ASAP.

Rep. Shaw's proposed amendments to the welfare law violate (TOO STRONG?) the negotiated,
bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a minimal safety net for disabled legal immigrants.

      THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET AGREEMENT POLICY PROTECTS THE MOST
       VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS: The bipartisan budget agreement policy restores SSI
       and Medicaid eligibility for legal immigrants who are or become disabled and who
       entered the U.S. as of August 22, 1996. This policy targets assistance to the most
       vulnerable individuals. Rep. Shaw's proposal would restore SSI and Medicaid eligibility
       only to those immigrants, both the disabled and low-income individuals over age 65,
       already receiving those benefits prior to August 23, 1996.

      THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET AGREEMENT ALREADY GRANDFATHERS A
       SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CURRENT CASELOAD: The bipartisan
       budget agreement would cover about 80 percent of the current SSI caseload, including all
       of the disabled and two-thirds of the cilrrent elderly caseload who are likely to meet the
       disability eligibility requirements required to retain coverage.

      PROPOSED GRANDFATHERING POLICY IGNORES VULNERABLE
       IMMIGRANTS WHO BECOME DISABLED AFTER AUGUST 22, 1996: This
       proposal abandons many legal immigrants who were in the U.S. as of that date but
       become severely disabled after that date. In contrast, the bipartisan budget policy
       protects those immigrants who may happen to fall victim to a disabling accident or
       illness.

       Example: A legal immigrant family entered the country 3 years ago. Both the father and
       mother have worked full-time since then, and have an annual income of about $25,000,
       but neither job provides health insurance for themselves or the family. Their 5 year-old
       son becomes severely disabled in a car accident next year. Under the budget agreement,
       he would be eligible for SSI and Medicaid; under Shaw's proposal he would be denied
       SSI -- and potentially denied Medicaid. (I'his example assumes the parents would
       rapidly "spend-down" due to hospital bills and become income-eligible for SS! and
       Medicaid.)

      DIFFICULT DECISIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE GIVEN THE
       LIMITED RESOURCES PROVIDED UNDER THE BUDGET AGREEMENT: The
       budget agreement not only contains specific budget levels for restoration of benefits to
       immigrants, but also explicitly states the policy of restoring SSI and Medicaid eligibility
       to immigrants who are or become disabled and who are in the U.S. as of August 22, 1996.
        This is one of only a handful of specific policies that were agreed to between the
       President and the Congressional leadership.

whose sponsors have income over 150% of the poverty level.

      THIS PROPOSAL WAS NOT PART OF THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET
       AGREEMENT. Rep. Shaw's proposal to severely limit the restoration of benefit to
       legal immigrants was not contemplated by the bipartisan budget agreement.

      THIS PROPOSAL IS UNFAIR TO FAMILIES OF LIMITED MEANS. Under this
       proposal, a family offour with an income as low as $24,000 would be called upon to fully
       support a person with a severe disability.

      DISABLED LEGAL IMMIGRANTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CALL ON THEIR
       SPONSORS FOR HELP. More than half of disabled legal immigrants currently
       receiving have been in the U.S. for over 15 years, and so they may find it difficult even to
       locate their sponsors. Since sponsorship agreements were not legally binding in the past,
       a disabled legal immigrant whose sponsor refuses to provide support would have no legal
       recourse and no source of income.
