       SUMMARY OF EMPOWERMENT ZONES IN BUDGET


        The Balanced Budget Agreement, signed into law by the President on August 5,1997,
creates 22 additional Empowerment Zones (EZs). Two of these Zones are to be selected within
180 days of August 5 (February 1, 1998) and 20 additional Zones are to be selected through a
longer-term process. Since there are currently nine EZs, the creation of 22 additional EZs brings
the new total number of EZs to 31. In general, the two additional Zones would receive a similar
package oftax incentives offered to the first-round designees and the 20 additional Zones would
receive a different set of tax benefits. The amount of direct grants that would be available is
currently pending in the Congressional Appropriations process.

       As in the first round, communities will be challenged to develop their own
comprehensive plans for revitalization, with the input of residents and a wide array of
stakeholders.

       I.    The 2 New Empowerment Zones (with "Round I" and other benefits)

        By February 1, 1998, the Secretary ofHUD will designate two additional urban EZs.
These two EZs, beginning in the year 2000, will be eligible in the main for the full tax incentives
offered to first-round EZ designees. This includes increased section 179 expensing, tax-exempt
bond financing for capital costs and investment, and a wage tax credit (phasing out between the
years 2005 and 2007) for up to $3,000 per employee for the cost of wages and training for
employees who are Zone residents. The two EZs would also be able to access two new measures
in the budget: 1) the Brownfie1ds tax incentive to allow clean-up costs paid or incurred before
the year 2001 to be deducted immediately for tax purposes; and 2) the public-school renovation
tax credit, which provides a $400 million per year credit allocated to states, over the next two
years, for the renovation and equipping of qualified public schools (with any unused allocation
carried forward to subsequent years).

        Communities that were designated in the first round as Supplemental Zones (Cleveland
and Los Angeles) and current Enterprise Communities would be eligible to compete for the new
designation, as would all other urban communities that met the EZ/EC poverty criteria. HUD
will provide details on the selection process shortly.

       II.   Additional 20 Empowerment Zones (with "Round II" benefits)

        The budget also includes a competition for a "second round" of20 EZ designations -- 15
 urban; 5 rural. These EZs will be eligible for the new Brownfields tax incentive and public
school tax credit outlined above, special expensing of business assets, and qualification for
private-activity bonds. The EZs can designate up to 2,000 acres of non-poverty area that can be
eligible for the Brownfie1ds tax incentive and the special private activity bonds.
                                                                      Hex-Dump ConveJ:Sion
       Communities eligible for the two additional Zones (but not designated as one ot the two
Zones), as well as qualified rural communities and Indian Nations, would be eligible for the
"second round" of 20 Zones. An interagency process will soon begin meeting to develop plans
regarding the application process.

       III.   New Benefits for AU EZs and ECs

All 105 existing EZ and EC communities -- plus the 22 new EZs will be eligible for:

      Brownfields Tax Incentive. All existing EZs and ECs and new EZs are eligible for
       this tax incentive, which will promote the clean-up and redevelopment of contaminated
       industrial sites.

      Relaxed Eligibility Rules for Bonds and Expensing. All existing EZs and ECs and
       new EZs would benefit from relaxed eligibility rules, allowing a broader range of
       businesses to qualify for the special tax-exempt private-activity bonds and section 179
       expensing (179 expensing applies only to EZs), which will promote commercial
       investment.

      Public-School Renovation Tax Credit. All existing EZs and ECs and new EZs are
       eligible for the public-school renovation tax credit, which will promote the creation of
       more rigorous schools and job-skilled youth.

      Work Opportunity Tax Credit. All existing EZs and ECs and new EZs are eligible for
       the extension of this tax credit, which will enable employers (until June 30, 1998) to
       claim a $2, I 00 tax credit for hiring at-risk youth and other hard-to-employ residents.


       IV.     New Benefits for "Round II" EZs

The 20 additional EZs, in addition to the above benefits, will be eligible for:

      Special Brownfields Tax Incentive. All new EZs are eligible for the enhanced
       Brownfields tax incentive, allowing designation of up to 2,000 acres of non-poverty,
       industrial acreage, which will be the focus of job creation for Zone residents.

      Enhanced Private-Activity Bonds. All new EZs are eligible for $60-230 million in
       flexible private-activity bond authority, outside the state volume cap, to subsidize
       job-creation and business expansion in the Zone (including up to 2,000 acres of
       non-poverty acreage noted above).

      Additional Section 179 Expensing. All new EZs are eligible for $20,000 in additional
       section 179 expensing of investments in capital and equipment (with liberalized
       eligibility rules noted above) in order to promote commercial investment.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

       v.     FY 98 Funding for the 22 EZs

        The President's FY 1998 budget plan included approximately $1 billion for direct grants
for new EZ designees over three years -- with $485 million targeted to 1998. FY 1998 .
Appropriations bills for the Departments of Labor, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban
Development are currently moving forward, and will likely reach Conference Committee in
September. As it stands, given the current status of these bills, the range of funding available
spans from $61 million (assuming absolute worst-possible case with Labor funding in view of
the authorization provision noted below) to $382 million, with much more likelihood on the
upside.

       Following is a specific breakdown of Agency requests:

        Dept. of Labor. DOL requested $250 million in FY 98 funding. The DOL Senate
Appropriations bill provides for the full $250 million (specifically for "Opportunity Areas for
Out-of-School Youth"), with this funding not available until October 1, 1998. The DOL House
Appropriations bill provides for a $100 million in such funding, with such funding not available
until July 1, 1999. Note that both bills currently include provisions that this funding cannot
become available without authorizing legislation (this is clearly an intolerable provision that
must be knocked out).

       Dept. of Agriculture. Agriculture requested $135 million in FY 98 funding. The
Agriculture Senate Appropriations bill includes $61 million and the corresponding House
Appropriations bill includes $82 million.

        Dept. of Housing and Urban Development. HUD requested $100 million in FY 98
funding. The HUD Senate Appropriations bill includes $25 million and the corresponding
House bill includes no funding.
