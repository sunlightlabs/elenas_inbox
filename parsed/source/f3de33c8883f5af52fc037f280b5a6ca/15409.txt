                             TEEN PREGNANCY PREVENTION
                                           May 2,1997


Announcement

May marks both teen pregnancy prevention month and the first anniversary of the National
Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. Today, in recognition of both these events, The First
Lady recognizes the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy's first 12 honorees--
individuals from around the country whose efforts to prevent teen pregnancy are making a
difference. The First Lady also discusses two new teen pregnancy prevention grant programs
and findings from a new study of childbearing and family planning to be released later this month
by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Background

The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy is a private nonprofit organization dedicated
to preventing teen pregnancy. It formed in response to President Clinton's challenge issued in
his 1995 State of the Union address that "parents and leaders across the country... join together in
a national campaign against teen pregnancy... " May 1997 marks the campaign's first
annIVersary.
Following his State ofthe Union comments, the President held a meeting at the White House
with a group of prominent teen pregnancy prevention experts and advocates to discuss what
might be done to combat the problem. From that meeting came a private sector planning effort
that led to the creation of the national campaign.

The campaign is chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean. Its Board of
Directors includes Whoopi Goldberg, Katherine Graham, the Hon. Nancy Kassebaum-Baker,
the Hon. Warren B. Rudman, and William A. Galston. Isabel V. Sawhill, President of the
Campaign, was an Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget during President
Clinton's first term.

To commemorate the anniversary of the national campaign, the First Lady is recognizing
12 honorees chosen by the Campaign for their outstanding leadership. Each represents
prevention approaches that are lowering teen pregnancy rates and strengthening communities.
The honorees' work embodies several key themes that are essential to preventing teen pregnancy:
             Emphasizing values and self-esteem in working with adolescents;
             Forging partnerships with the corporate sector;
             Focusing the community on a "unity of goal" to prevent teen pregnancy
              even when there are conflicts over program approaches;
             Encouraging adult-child communication;
             Involving youth in the discussion;
             Emphasizing the importance of male involvement in prevention;
             Recognizing the importance of program evaluation; and
             Involving the media in reducing teen pregnancy.

Secretary Shalala's Announcements

In Los Angeles yesterday (May 1), Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala
announced two new community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote
responsible behavior. One program will be aimed at teenage girls and the other at teenage boys.
 Both grow out of HHS' new Girl Power! Campaign which is aimed at enhancing self-esteem,
promoting good health, and preventing unhealthy behaviors among girls 9 to 14 years old. Each
of the grant programs will total about $1 million per year and involve pUblic-private partnerships
organized by individual communities.

The Secretary also discussed a new study, to be released later this month by HHS, which shows
the percentage of teenagers who have had sex declined in the 1990s after increasing steadily for
more than two decades. The decline is small -- 5 percentage points -- but is significant because it
shows that the long-term increase in teenage sexual activity may finally be over. This data is
part of a new study of child bearing and family planning covering all women 15-44.

               BACKGROUND AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS FACT SHEET

Over the past four years, the Clinton Administration has launched a comprehensive effort to
prevent teen pregnancy. Data shows we are making progress:

      Teen birth rates have fallen four years in a row, by 10 percent since 1991 (from 62.1
       births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 in 1991 to 55.6 births in June 1996); and
      A new study, to be released later this month by HHS, shows the percentage ofteenagers
       who have had sex declined in the 1990s (from 55 percent in 1990 to 50 percent in 1995).

However, there is still much work to do. More than 4 out of 10 young women become pregnant
before age 20 -- nearly a million a year -- and 75 percent of those who give birth do so outside of
marriage. Teen pregnancy remains a major social problem for this country and one that none of
us can ignore. Yesterday, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala announced two
new community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote responsible behavior.
Today, in honor of teen pregnancy prevention month and the first anniversary of the National
Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, the First Lady will recognize 12 individuals from around
the country whose efforts to prevent teen pregnancy are making a difference.

Administration Accomplishments

      Since 1993, the Administration has supported innovative and promising teen pregnancy
       prevention strategies tailored to the unique needs of communities. HHS-supported
       programs already reach about 30 percent or 1,410 communities in the United States.

      In his 1995 State of the Union address, President Clinton challenged "parents and leaders
       across the country ... to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to
       make a difference." In response to his challenge, The National Campaign to Prevent
       Teen Pregnancy was formed. The national campaign is a private nonprofit organization
       dedicated to preventing teen pregnancy by supporting values and fostering actions that are
       consistent with a pregnancy-free adolescence. This month marks the national
       campaign's first anniversary.

      The President has consistently supported efforts to reduce teen pregnancy as part of
       welfare reform, and the law he signed in August 1996 contains several important
       provisions:
             Unmarried minor parents are required to stay in school and live at home, or in an
               adult-supervised setting in order to receive assistance;
             It encourages "second chance homes" -- adult supervised residential homes
              designed to provide teen parents with the skills and supports they need;
              $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education activities is
               provided starting FY 1998;
             The law includes the toughest ever child support enforcement measurements that
              send a strong message to young boys and girls that they should not have children
              until they are ready to provide for them.

     HHS last October released data showing an 8 percent drop in teen birth rates from 1991
      to 1995, and the latest data available though June 1996 indicates that the decline has
      continued. The birth rate for teenagers as of June 1996 stood at 55.6 births per 1,000
      women aged 15-19 years, compared to 62.1 in 1991, a decline of 10 percent since 1991.

     Just yesterday, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala announced two
      new community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote responsible
      behavior. One program will be aimed at teenage girls and the other at teenage boys.
      Both grants grow out ofHHS's new Girl Power! Campaign which is aimed at enhancing
      self-esteem, promoting good health, and preventing unhealthy behaviors among girls 9 to
      14 years old. Each of the grant programs will total about $1 million per year and involve
      public-private partnerships organized by individual communities.

     The Secretary also discussed a new study, to be released later this month by HHS, that
      shows the percentage ofteenagers who have had sex declined in the 1990s after
      increasing steadily for more than two decades . The decline is small -- 5 percent -- but is
      significant because it shows that the long-term increase in teenage sexual activity may
      finally be over. This data is part of a new study of child bearing and family planning
      covering all women 15-44.

The Challenge

     As much as we have done and as much progress as we have seen, there is much more
      work to do.

     Every year in this country, over one million teenagers become pregnant and four in 10
      girls become pregnant as least once before turning 20.

     The encouraging recent decline in the U.S. teen birth rate is counterbalanced by a
      negative trend: today, nearly three-quarters of teen births are to unmarried teens, up from
      15 percent 30 years ago. Today, teen mothers make up the largest group (48 percent) of
      all first births .to unmarried women.

     Early parenting limits a young mother's likelihood of completing high school -- less than
      one-third of teens who begin their families before age 18 ever complete high school --
      and increases the likelihood that that young mother will end up in poverty.

     When compared to children of older mothers, children of teen mothers have more health
      problems, do much worse in school, live in home environments oflower quality, suffer
      higher rates of abuse and neglect, and are more likely to become teen mothers themselves.

Q&A MAY 2 TEEN PREGNANCY EVENT

Question:   Why did you choose to honor these specific programs picked by the National
            Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy?

Answer:     Each of these people has offered tremendous leadership in the fight against teen
            pregnancy. The honorees' work embodies several key themes that are essential
            to preventing teen pregnancy: emphasizing values and self-esteem in working
            with adolescents; forging partnerships with the corporate sector; encouraging
            adult-child communication; involving youth in the discussion; emphasizing the
            importance of male involvement in prevention; and involving the media.

Question:   What was it that Secretary Shalala announced yesterday in California?

Answer:     Just yesterday, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala announced
            two new community grant programs to prevent teen pregnancy and promote
            responsible behavior. One program will be aimed at teenage girls and the other
            at teenage boys. Both grants grow out ofHHS's new Girl Power! Campaign
            which is aimed at enhancing self-esteem, promoting good health, and preventing
            unhealthy behaviors among girls 9 to 14 years old. Each of the grant programs
            will total about $1 million per year and involve pUblic-private partnerships
            organized by individual communities.

            The Secretary also discussed a new study, to be released later this month by HHS,
            that shows the percentage of teenagers who have had sex declined in the 1990s
            after increasing steadily for more than two decades. The decline is small -- 5
            percentage points -- but is significant because it shows that the long-term increase
            in teenage sexual activity may finally be over. This data is part of a new study of
            child bearing and family planning covering all women 15-44 which should be
            available in about a month.

Question:   How much has the teen birth rate fallen over the past several years?

Answer:     HHS last October released data showing an 8 percent drop in teen birth rates from
            1991 to 1995, and the latest data available though June 1996 indicates that the
            decline has continued. The birth rate for teenagers as of June 1996 stood at 55.6
            births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 years, compared to 62.1 in 1991, a decline of
            10 percent since 1991.

Question:   Why do you cite teen birth rates but not teen pregnancy rates? Have teen
            pregnancy rates fallen too?

Answer:     Teen pregnancy rates refer to the rate at which teen become pregnant while teen
            birth rates measure the rate at which teens actually give birth. Teen pregnancy
            rates and teen birth rates have both fallen over the last few years. Teen
            pregnancy rates fell slightly from a high of 117 pregnancies per 1,000 women in
            1990 to 112 per 1,000 women in 1992 (the most recent year for which data is
            available). The reason we more often cite teen birth rates rather than teen
            pregnancy rates is that teen birth rates are more current.

Question:   What causes the difference between the teen pregnancy rate and the teen birth
            rate?

Answer:     More than half ofteen pregnancies result in birth, one third end in abortion and
            another 14 percent end in miscarriage.

Question:   In other words, are you saying that teen pregnancy increases the incidence of
            abortion?

Answer:     Since 1990, abortion rates among teens have declined because fewer teens are
            becoming pregnant, and, in recent years, fewer pregnant teens have chosen to have
            an abortion. Today, one-third of teens end their pregnancies in abortion, and
            teens account for roughly one- quarter of all abortions perfonned annually. I
            believe there is no stronger argument for teen pregnancy prevention and family
            planning than the need to reduce the number of abortions in this country.

Question:   Isn't abstinence alone the best way to prevent abortion? Don't family planning
            and sex education increase abortion?

Answer:     We believe unmarried teenagers should abstain from having sex. However, it is
            unrealistic, even dangerous, to ignore the fact that some teens will, in fact, have
            sex outside of marriage and before they are ready for it. It is for that reason, that
            we must simultaneously preach abstinence and teach teen about family planning
            and sex including the use of birth control. By offering teens family planning and
            sex education, we are working to prevent abortion.

Question:   Isn't teen pregnancy primarily a problem in African-American neighborhoods?

Answer:                              a
            No. Teen pregnancy is problem every, across racial and socio-economic lines.
            About half of all pregnant teens aged 15-19 are white. However, teen birth rates
            are higher among African-American and Hispanic teens than among white teens.

Question:   What are the negative effects on a teen mother and her child?

Answer:     Early parenting limits a young mother's likelihood of completing high school--
            less than one-third of teens who begin their families before age 18 ever complete
            high school -- and increases the likelihood that young mother will end up in
            poverty, as well as causing other hardships. In addition, the children of teen
            mothers have more health problems, do much worse in school, live in home
            environments oflower quality, suffer higher rates of abuse and neglect, and are
            more likely to become teen mothers themselves.

Question:   What else has the Clinton Administration done to prevent teen pregnancy?

Answer:     We have done a lot.

            Since 1993, the Administration has supported innovative and promising teen
            pregnancy prevention strategies tailored to the unique needs of communities.
            HHS-supported programs already reach about 30 percent or 1,410 communities in
            the United States.

            In his 1995 State of the Union address, President Clinton challenged "parents and
            leaders across the country ... to join together in a national campaign against teen
            pregnancy to make a difference." In response to his challenge, The National
            Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy was formed. The National Campaign is a
            private nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing teen pregnancy. This
            month marks the National Campaign's first anniversary.

            The President has consistently supported efforts to reduce teen pregnancy as part
            of welfare reform, and the law he signed in August 1996 contains several
            important provisions:
                  Unmarried minor parents are required to stay in school and live at home,
                   or in an adult-supervised setting in order to receive assistance;
                  "Second Chance Homes" -- adult supervised residential homes designed to
                   provide teen parents with the skills and supports they need to finish
                   school, become good role models, and providers for their children -- are
                   allowed and encouraged;
                  $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education activities
                   is provided starting FY 1998;
                  The new law includes tough child support measurements that send the
                   strongest possible message to young boys and girls that they should not
                   have children until they are ready to provide for them.

Question:   Last year the President appointed Dr. Henry Foster as his senior advisor on teen
            pregnancy prevention and youth issues. What has Dr. Foster accomplished to
            date?

Answer:     Dr. Foster is a key part ofthe Administration's effort to send a message to
            teenagers of the importance of postponing child bearing until they are
            emotionally, physically, and financially prepared for the responsibility. Dr.
            Foster has spent the last year-plus traveling around the country visiting with
            teenagers and community-based prevention programs.

                             Whatever Happened to Childhood?
              Published by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy

On May 2nd, the National Campaign To Prevent Teen Pregnancy will release its report,
"Whatever Happened to Childhood?"

The report aptly illustrates teen pregnancy as a social crisis that continues to break down family,
community and common culture. The message the report sends is twofold: I) although we are
making some progress, there is much more work to do and we must not let our attention stray
from this critical national issue and, 2) despite consistent community-based efforts, the evidence
has not born out a simple solution to the problem so we must continue to be creative, innovative
and persistent in our efforts.

Of the many community experiments around the country, the report states, most have exhibited
mixed outcomes, and no one program stands out as having produced clear, replicable results.
Community approaches include sex education aimed at delaying sexual activity and reducing the
number of sexual partners and using birth control; abstinence only programs; support for
community-based family planning services; comprehensive approaches stresses components
from each approach and; programs dedicated to nurturing and guiding young people.

In addition to these conclusions, the report also presents some interesting observations that may
have future policy implications.

First, the vast majority (85 percent) of pregnancies among teens are not fully planned or
unintended. Rather they result from teens' ambivalence about pregnancy, accidents, their
confusion about preventing pregnancy, and sometimes their failure to make any clear decision
about sexual activity.

 Second, many communities do not address the problem at all because the conflict over which
 approach to use can become so intense that a community decides to do nothing at all. Therefore,
the report states, a new and emerging approach to teen pregnancy prevention is community
conflict resolution. The report lays out an excellent example of this approach at work. In 1990,
the rural community of Tillamook County, Oregon had the highest teen pregnancy rate in the
 state but fought bitterly over a solution (the Board of Education even voted down several
proposals.) Fi~ally, the County decided to embrace a new ethic of ''unity of purpose, diversity
of means," allowing various segments of the community to develop their own intensive
initiatives, from creating a church-based abstinence program to improving access to family
planning programs. By 1994, the county teen pregnancy rate had dropped by 70 percent,
becoming the lowest in the state. This story is an illustration ofa finding supported in research.
  Dr. Kristen Moore, a member of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy board, has
found that pregnancy programs that send mixed messages to teens actually work because the
teen will be exposed to all messages and will take what works for her or him, whether it be
abstinence, birth control, or self-esteem raising.

Third, although the teen birth rate has decreased in the past few years, the number of births to
teens increased in 1993 and 1994, reflecting an overall increase in the U.S. teen population.
Because the number ofteens is expected to increase further, so will the number of pregnancies
and births, perhaps increasing by 26 percent by the year 2010 unless rates are reduced.

The report tells its story using mostly previously released data that remain relevant. Following
are facts from the report worth reviewing.

      Every year in this country, over 1 million teenagers become pregnant and four in 10 girls
       become pregnant as least once before turning 20.

      The pregnancy rate increased among all girls age 15-19 by 23 percent between 1972 and
       1990 from 95 to 117 pregnancies per 1,000 women, and then declined to 112 per 1,000
       women in 1992 (the year for which the most recent data is available). At the same time,
       the pregnancy rate among sexually experienced girls decreased 19 percent, largely due to
       increased use of contraception.

      By 1991, the teen birth rate had reached 62 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19, its
       highest point in the past two decades. Since then, that rate has fallen slowly to 57 births
       per 1,000 women in 1995.

      The encouraging recent decline in the U.S. teen birth rate is counterbalanced by a
       negative trend: today, nearly three-quarters of teen births are to unmarried teens, while as
       recently as 1960, only 15 percent were. Today, teen mothers make up the largest group
       (48 percent) of all first births to unmarried women.

      Birth rates are higher among African-American and Hispanic teens than among white
       teens

      While most pregnant teens are 18 or 19 years old, about 40 percent are 17 or younger and
       about half of all pregnant teens ages 15-19 are white.

      Many of the fathers of children born to teen mothers are older -- nearly 40 percent of
       those young men who impregnate a minor teen (under 18) are 20 years old or older.

      More than half of the teen pregnancies result in a birth (113 end in abortion and 14 percent
       in miscarriage) and of those who give birth most keep their child rather than put it up for
       adoption.

      Early p톋renting limits a young mother's likelihood of completing high school -- less than
       one-third of teens who begin their families before age 18 ever complete high school.

      When compared to children of older mothers, children of teen mothers have more health
       problems, do much worse in school, live in home environments oflower quality, suffer
       higher rates of abuse and neglect, and are more likely to become teen mothers themselves.
