            STRENGTHENING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RESULTS IN ESEA

        The 1994 enactment of Goals 2000 and reauthorization of ESEA marked a sea-change in
federal education policy by insisting that states set high standards for all students, measure
student and school progress toward reaching the standards, and by taking the first steps to focus
accountability on achieving results rather than complying with regulations. Our 1999 ESEA
reauthorization proposal will complete this process by establishing a basic framework for holding
states and school districts, schools and teachers, and students accountable for results. It does this
by building on and strengthening provisions already in law and adding new provisions.

I.     STRENGTHENING ACCOUNTABILITY: REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTICIPATION
       IN ESEA

Our approach to strengthening accountability for results would require states to:

Establish High Standards and Aligned Assessments. We would retain provisions of current
law, which require states to establish content and student performance standards and assessments
aligned to the standards by 2000-01 school year. States must also define adequate yearly
progress -       increases in the percentage of students meeting state performance standards -- for
Title 1 schools and local school districts in a manner that would result in continuous and
substantial progress toward meeting state standards within a reasonable time frame.

Produce and Disseminate School, District and State Report Cards that Focus on Results.
As a condition of receiving ESEA funds, we would require states and school districts to produce
annual report cards, easily understood by and widely distributed to parents and the public, for
each school, school district and the state as a whole. The report cards would include
information on student achievement, teacher professional qualifications, class size, school safety,
attendance, and graduation rates. Where appropriate the student achievement data would be
disaggregated by demographic subgroups, to allow a greater focus on the gaps between minority
and majority, low-income and more advantaged students.        In addition, states would be
required to publicly identify the lowest performing schools, so that parents and community
members are aware of the need for improvement, and so local school boards and school
administrators are under immediate pressure to address the situation.

        Title 1 currently requires school and school district profiles, including disaggregated
achievement data, after States have their final assessments in place. Our proposal strengthens
this provision by requiring report cards for all schools, not just those participating in Title 1,
expanding the data to be reported, requiring the report cards to be widely disseminated, and
requiring state level report cards as well.

Take Immediate Corrective Actions to Turn Around the Lowest Performing Schools.
States would be required to identify the lowest performing schools that are not making
improvement, and make the identification public. These should be the schools with the lowest


                                                 1
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conv0ision


levels of student perfonnance which have made little or no improvement over the previous 3
years. States shouldjdentify a reasonable number oflow-perfonning schools in order to be able
to provide appropriate assistance to each. States must take corrective actions in these schools,
based on an external audit and which address fundamental staffing and curricular issues that are
fundamental for improved student perfonnance. Initially, corrective actions will include
multiple supports such as provision of extended learning opportunities, implementation of
proven school refonn models, and extensive teacher training. If these actions do not result in
satisfactory improvements in student perfonnance within 2 years, corrective actions must then
include steps to replace adults in the school, either by reconstituting the school and making
wholesale staff changes, or by closing the school down entirely and reopening it with new staff or
as a charter school. These steps must be accompanied by due process for staff, and must include
a clear plan for improving the school. Even after these steps have been taken, the State
continues to have responsibility for ensuring that student achievement improves in the school.
The Secretary will also have the authority to withhold ESEA funds provided for state
administration if the state fails to fulfill its responsibilities. This approach will penalize state
officials without taking funds away from services to students.

       Our ESEA reauthorization proposal would set aside 2.5% of Title 1 funds to fund the
requirement for states to intervene in failing schools. The FY2000 budget requests $200 million
to jump start this process by requiring states to begin interventions in the lowest perfonning
schools immediately.

End Social Promotion. States would be required to end social promotion by adopting (or
requiring local school districts to adopt) policies that (1) require students to meet academic
perfonnance standards at key transition points (e.g., 4th and 8th grade, prior to high school
graduation) before being promoted; (2) use multiple measures, including an assessment valid for
these purposes as the primary tool to detennine if a student has met the standards; (3) pennit
other factors such as teacher evaluation to enter into a final detennination as to whether the
student has met the standards and should be promoted.

        While requiring students to meet standards sends them an important message that
"perfonnance counts", the more important message in this policy is that schools and school
systems must devise and implement strategies for helping students meet the standards - on
time. States and school districts would be required to show how they will help students meet
promotion standards on time by (1) strengthening learning opportunities in the classroom with
clear standards, small classes with well-prepared teachers, high quality professional
development, use of proven instructional practices, and early identification and intervention for
students who need extra help; (2) providing extended learning time for students who need extra
help, including after-school and summer school; and (4) providing appropriate programs for
students who still do not meet the standards, rather than simply having them repeat an entire
grade.

       States would be given four years to phase in this requirement, in order to provide the time


                                                 2
                                                                                              Hux-Dump CunVCiSIJn


     necessary to ensure that adequate learning opportunities are available for all students, and
     especially for those in low performing schools and school systems. However, states would have
     to commit to this policy, provide a detailed plan for its implementation, and identify annual
     implementation milestones in order to receive funding at the beginning of the jive year period.
     The plan, due within six months of the passage of the Act, would require the approval of the
     Secretary of Education, who could withhold funding if the state failed to follow through with its
     implementation plan.

     Assume Greater Responsibility for Teacher Quality - and Hold Teachers Accountable for
     Performance. As a condition of receiving funding under ESEA, states would be required to:

           Implement performance-based assessments for initial licensing. States would be
            required to develop and implement performance-based assessments for the initial
            licensing of teachers, aligned with student content and performance standards. These
            assessments would include written exams of content and teaching knowledge as well as
            an evaluation of teaching performance. The assessment of teaching performance could
            take place during a traditional teacher education program or during the first year of
            teaching for those who enter the classroom through alternative routes.

           End the use of unqualified teachers. States would be required to phase out the use of
            (1) teachers with emergency rather than full certification, (2) teachers teaching "out of
            field", and (3) the use of teacher's aides as primary instructors. These practices are
            particularly prevalent in high poverty, low-performing schools, and it will be essential to
            end them if we are to close achievement gaps, tum around failing schools, and help
            students meet promotion and graduation standards.

           Provide support/or new teachers. States, working with their local school districts,
            would be required to develop and implement comprehensive support programs for
            teachers during their first three years in the classroom. Such programs could include
            year-long mentoring and coaching by trained mentor teachers, team teaching with veteran
            teachers, time for observation of and consultation with veteran teachers, assignment of
            fewer course preparations, and provision of additional time for course preparation.

           Provide effective, ongoing professional development. States must require that school
            districts provide time for sustained, high quality professional development, and develop
            districtwide professional development plans. These plans must be based on assessment of
            student needs and formulated with the active participation of classroom teachers in the
            district.

           Hold teachers accountable by their colleagues through peer review. States must
            require local school districts to evaluate and hold teachers accountable for performance.
            School districts would be required to implement a peer review processes, in cooperation
            with their local teacher's union, to raise the standards of teaching within the district and to


                                                      3

              identify, assist and if necessary quickly but fairly remove teachers who fail to perform at
              adequate levels. Teachers' classroom performance and effectiveness would be judged by
              other teachers who are trained evaluators. This process would strengthen accountability
              within the profession, and allow teacher to help each other improve their teaching
              methods.


       II.    REWARDING SUCCESS: THE EDUCATION EXCELLENCE FUND

               The overriding goal of our ESEA proposal is to help all students reach challenging
       academic standards and to close the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic gaps in student
       achievement at the same time. The accountability provisions, funding programs and targeting
       provisions in ESEA are all designed to work together to accomplish this purpose. We propose
       an Education Excellence Fund to reward those states, school districts and schools that make
       significant progress toward that goal.

       Rewarding States and Cities that Raise Student Achievement and Close Achievement Gaps.
        Based on the policy and resource allocation decisions they make, states and large local school
       systems have the capacity to improve student achievement on a large scale and for all students.
       The Education Excellence Fund will provide financial rewards to any state, and any of the 100
       largest urban school districts, that make significant gains, sustained over three years, in
       increasing student achievement overall, and in reducing disparaties in student achievement on the
       basis of race, ethnicity and socioeconomic background. III order to determine which states and
       cities will receive rewards, the Secretary will set improvement targets each state must meet.
       These targets will be based on state assessments in reading and math, and may include other
       indicators such as improvements in other academic subjects, drop-out rates, student attendence or
       other areas of performance as agreed to by the Secretary and each state or large school district.
       Each state and each of the eligible school districts will be able to receive an award if meets its
       improvement targets. the improvement targets svery city will be able to win, if they meet
       performance goals.

       $1 Billion Over 5 Years. The fund will provide a billion dollars over 5 years in rewards to
       states, school districts and schools. Rewards will be provided for the first time in FY2000?,
       three years after ESEA is expected to pass. This will allow time for each state to adopt new
       assessments and for the Secretary of Education to establish improvement targets for each state
       and large district. Half of the funds will be reserved for states, and half for the largest urban
       school districts. Funds will be allocated to states and school districts on the basis of the Title 1
       formula, so that each receives the same share of these funds that it would receive under Title 1.
       Funds allocated to states and school districts that do not make enough improvement to qualify for
       the reward will be reallocated to the states and school districts that do.

       Rewarding Schools that Make Outstanding Improvements. States and large urban school
       districts will be required to distribute 90% of the funds to the schools in each jurisdiction that


                                                        4
      have made the greatest gains in student achievement overall, especially with disadvantaged
      students. The Excellence Fund will support awards of $40,000 to $50,000 per school for
      between 3,600 and 4,500 schools, between 4-5% of all public schools. Each school that receives
      the awards will be able to use the funds for any activities it determines can help further its efforts
      to improve student achievement. Similarly, each state and school district will able able to retain
      up 10% ofthe funds, for any activities it determines will help improve student achievement in its
      jurisdiction.
