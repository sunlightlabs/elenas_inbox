TEXT:
Message Creation Date was at 24-0CT-1997 19:10:00

TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  ACTING DEP. DIR. FOR MANAGEMENT ED DESEVE
  EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR JOSH GOTBAUM

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: OCTOBER 24, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Today Senators Byrd and Moynihan introduced a bill S. 1319 to repeal the Line
Item Veto Act.

CONGRESS TODAY (10/24)

SENATE
Failed (43-49) to invoke cloture on the modified committee amendment to S.
1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997. (Cioture
was also defeated twice on Thursday.)   Senator Lott today filed another cloture
motion on the modified committee amendment. This fourth cloture vote will
occur on Tuesday.   Lott has indicated this will be the last cloture attempt on
ISTEA.
  [SAP sent, 10/8: Administration supports Senate passage, but has a number of
concerns, including making the bill fully consistent with the Bipartisan
Budget Agreement.]

Passed (UC) H.R. 2013 - Designating the David B. Champagne Post Office
Building, clearing the measure for the President

HOUSE
Adopted (233-171) H.R. 2107 - Interior Appropriations Conference Report
(Adopted the Rule by a vote of 247-166)
[Letter sent 9/30: Senior advisers veto recommendation based on House failure
to fund NEA and to provide $700 million in land acquisition funds (BBA
violation); objectionable House/Senate environmental riders.]

Continued consideration of, but did not complete action on H.R. 2247 - Amtrak
Reform and Privatization Act of 1997 (Open Rule)
 [House Rules SAP sent 10/21: Administration strongly opposes]
While under consideration of H.R. 2247, the House took the following action:
o LaTourette proposed an amendment to replace ShusterD,s labor reforms with a
proposal similar to the AdministrationD,s.  Representative Quinn offered a
perfecting amendment that would have effectively wiped out the LaTourette
amendment. The Quinn perfecting amendment was rejected by a vote of 198-223.


Subsequently, Chairman Shuster pulled the bill from the floor to avoid votes on
the underlying Latourette amendment (a vote for labor and against Shuster) and
final passage.

Rejected (168-244) Motion to Adjourn
