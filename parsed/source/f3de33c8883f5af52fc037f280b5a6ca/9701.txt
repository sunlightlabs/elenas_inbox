Purpose

Amends Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to create a new Part D. The
purpose of this new part is to provide funds to local educational agencies to allow such agencies
to hire high quality teachers, including special education teachers, [and] reduce class size in the
early grades to a national goal of 18, and raise student achievement.

Use of Funds Part D

       Local educational agencies shall use funds made available under this section to improve
teacher quality, reduce the number of children in regular classes, and raise student achievement
through [for] one or more of the following activities:

      Hiring new high quality teachers who have successfully completed an academic major in
       the subject area in which they plan to teach and possess strong teaching skills;

      Hiring new high quality teachers through State and local altemative teacher certification
       procedures;

      Reducing class size by increasing the ratio of classroom teachers to students;

      Providing professional development to teachers to teach special needs children [and to
       reduce the costs associated with teaching children identified as special education
       students];

      Providing professional development to teachers consistent with Title II of the Higher
       Education Act Amendments of 1998;

      [Providing for the acquisition and use of instructional and educational materials to assist
       classroom teachers to improve students achievement; or,]

      [Providing for teacher] Testing new teachers using State competency exams based on the
       subject areas taught by the teacher, or content deemed appropriate by the State for
       elementary school teachers.

                                                                     Automated Records Management - J __
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

      No local education agency may use more than 5 percent of its allocation for local
       administrative costs.

Special Priorities

      In hiring new quality teachers under this section, local educational agencies may give
       priority to hiring new special education teachers, teachers ofLimited-English proficient
       students, teachers in subject areas with a shortage of qualified teachers, and teachers in
       schools with large class sizes.

Funding Formula

      Over and above the money currently allocated to Title VI activities, an additional $1.1
       billion will be dispersed pursuant to this part.

      For purposes of this part, the State educational agency shall distribute 100 percent of
       these funds directly to local educational agencies based upon the formula in the title I of
       the Elementary and Secondary Education Act adjusted for the hold-harmless provision
       [under this section (this is the current Title VI formula which is distributed based on
       student enrollment in public and private nonprofit schools within the local education
       agency based on the following criteria:

               Children living in areas with high concentrations oflow income families;
               Children from low income families; and
               Children living in sparsely populated areas.)]

Application Process

        There will be no new application required. Instead, Local Education Agencies will submit
to the State, in its application for funds under Title VI, a description of how they will meet the
requirements of this part. The State shall be responsible for ensuring compliance by the local
education agencies.

Annual Public Report Card

      At the end of each school year in which a school receives funds under this program, the
       local education agency shall issue a report card on that school to parents and the
       general public. The report card shall provide clear, and easily understandable
       information on (1) class size reduction goals in grades 1-3 and other grade levels
       determined by the LEA, (2) actual class sizes that year (3) teacher certification, licensure
       and related academic qualifications for teachers, (4) student achievement levels in
      .reading in grades 1-3, and in other grade levels and subject areas determined by the
       local education agency.

          Based on the public report card the state may require a local education agency to take
           appropriate corrective actions as a condition for continued receipt offunds.

    Local Control

             If the local education agency [decides] determines by an affinnative approval ofthe local
    school board, that it [do not need funds] has met its goals for reducing class size and raising
    student achievement [under this part for the purposes of hiring quality teachers and reducing class
    size,] then the local educational agency can spend these funds on activities under section 6301.
