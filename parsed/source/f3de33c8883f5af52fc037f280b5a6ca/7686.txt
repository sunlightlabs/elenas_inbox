                    STATE TOBACCO SETTLEMENT FUNDS
                               May 15, 1998


   $196 billion over 25 years from the legislation will be allocated to states from a trust
    fund .. These grants will be a mandatory, pennanent appropriation. Federal spending for
    new options on children's health outreach will be netted from this amount.

   50 percent of the grants may be used by states for any purpose. The remaining 50
    percent will be used for specified restricted purposes, described below.

   Options for restricted funds. States can use the restricted funds in any amount that
    they choose (except for CHIP) to add to anyone or all of the following options:

           Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration grant programs
           Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Title V program
           Child Care and Development Block Grant
           Child welfare programs (Title IV-B)
           Safe and Drug-Free Schools program
           Professional Development (Eisenhower) grants
           Match for the Children's Health Insurance Program (limited to 5 percent of
           restricted funds)

   Each program's current matching rules will be used except for an increased Federal
    match of 80 percent for child care block grant funds above the appropriated amount.

   Supplement, not supplanting spending: Funds from the restricted portion of the grants
    may not be used as state match for Federal programs (except for CHIP). There will be a
    maintenance of effort on a program-specific basis, that consists of:

           95 percent of the FFY 1997 state spending on the programs listed below, trended
           by the lower of inflation (CPI) or the Federal appropriation growth.

   Options for the use of restricted funds will be re-assessed every 5 years. An
    independent organization (e.g., General Accounting Office or National Academy of
    Sciences) will conduct evaluations and assessments of spending options every 5 years,
    and make recommendations on improvements.
                       Note: Assumes that this agreement is good only through the Senate Debate
