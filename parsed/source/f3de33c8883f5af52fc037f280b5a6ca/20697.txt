                                           LOCATION: Ernest N. Morial Convention Center

I. PURPOSE

        You will be addressing the American Federation of Teachers' Bi-Annual Convention. In
your remarks you will discuss the importance of school discipline and school safety. You will
also announce a White House Conference on School Safety and highlight some of the school
safety policies promoted by the Administration--school uniforms, tough truancy laws,
community-based curfews and zero tolerance for guns. You will call on Congress to support
your education agenda: improving and reforming K-12 education by raising standards for
students and teachers; strengthening accountability; expanding public school choice; reducing
class size; modernizing public schools, investing in technology; expanding after-school learning
and ending social promotions.

II. BACKGROUND

        AFT will be voting to elect new officers and a new executive council. Sandy Feldman
will be re-elected President and Ed McElroy will be re-elected Secretary-Treasurer. Nat LaCour
will be elected to a newly created Executive Vice President position. LaCour is also a member
of the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars.

        On Friday, Sandy Feldman called on state and local elected officials to stop issuing
emergency credentials to teachers. She also outlined a 7 point plan to improve teacher quality
that includes the following: incentives for experienced but ready-to-retire teachers to remain in
the classrooms; incentives for teachers to become certified in additional fields; flexible
scheduling and part-time teaching opportunities for retired teachers; recruiting paraprofessionals
with college credits and supporting their efforts to become teachers; raising teachers' salaries
and returning qualified supervisors and administrators to the classroom.

       The biggest convention issue for AFT was the AFTINEA merger vote. Three weeks ago,
delegates to the NEA Representative Assembly voted against the merger proposal--60% to 40%.
Nonetheless, AFT Convention delegates will vote on the merger proposal. Additionally, the
delegates will vote on whether authority should be given to local and state bodies to merge
voluntarily with NEA local and state affiliates.
