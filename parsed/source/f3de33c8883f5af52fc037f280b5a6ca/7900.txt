SUBJECT: MEETING WITH BOB CHASE AND SANDY FELDMAN


The primary focus of the meeting should be how we work to achieve our common agenda of
increasing the Federal investment in education.
       For us, the main struggle is finding hooks for engaging the Congress and getting press
        attention on these issues.
       From them, we should ask for a report on their current and planned activities with
        Congress and in the field.
We should also touch on some of the areas where the Congress has attempted to put Democrats
on the defensive.

I. The Common Agenda

The NEA and AFT are strong supporters of our efforts on education, especially:
     school modernization
     class size reduction
     increased spending on discretionary programs (we differ on special education, which our
      budget essentially straight-lined and Republicans plan to increase).

Status: The Republicans this year have made a greater effort to appear to be/or something,
rather than just opposed to our pro-education efforts. That has made it more difficult, at least so
far, to draw the stark distinctions that have helped us to define -- and win -- the debate in prior
years. Our efforts to substitute school construction for the Coverdell bill yielded strong votes,
but no victory. We have been unsuccessful in getting class size as part of the tobacco deal
(though the NIH funding would relieve pressure on appropriations). And the allocation for
Labor-HHS-Education appropriations, while basically consistent with the BBA, will not support
our investments.

                                                 I
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
Strategy: Resolution of these issues -- if any -- will occur in the final weeks of the legislative
session. So far, however, observers in the press do not see education as a major item of
dissention that will need to be worked out this year. Our chances of succeeding are low unless
we begin raising the temperature now so that Congress feels intense heat on this issue. We can
do that through the bully pulpit, and Democrats in Congress can help by offering amendments
and using the legislative process in other ways to force the issues. In short, we must take every
opportunity to emphasize our education priorities. Some of the opportunities include:

      Signing of Highway Bill: building on the President's prior statements about the need to
       invest in the education infrastructure, challenge Congress to pass the school
       modemization bill (which provides bonds worth just 10% of the highway investment).
      House budget resolution: Criticize cuts to education that would be required (treat
       Kasich'soriginal assumptions as real); insist on investment, not just maintaining current
       levels.
      Veto of CoverdeU bill: push modem schools and smaller class size as the logical,
       constructive approach.
      Tax bill: Insist on school construction as a part of any bill.
      Labor/HHS appropriations mark-ups: Pounce on them immediately for failing to
       invest.
      Putting Class Size Reduction back in play: With tobacco funding no longer viable, we
       need to put the class size proposal back onto the agenda by proposing an offset. OMB is
       searching for any offsets we could possibly use, though this will be difficult.
      Finding additional cosponsors for School Modernization: Now that there is a
       Republican cosponsor of the School Modernization bill (Rep. Leach, thanks to NEA's
       efforts), escalate our cosponsor-gathering activities.

We need help from the Democrats in Congress. In order for the above to succeed, we need
Democrats to join with us in these efforts. If Democrats cut their own deals -- e.g. on
appropriations -- then it will be much more difficult to make the case for the overall investments.

II. Defensive Efforts

Republicans will continue to press us on a number of issues, including:

      CoverdeU (education savings accounts for private K-12 education). At some point -- but
       not to be discussed Monday -- we may need to think about versions that we might
       ultimately find acceptable, in exchange for other of our priorities.
      Block Grants. As the Republican proposals get more sophisticated, some Dems may
       find that they need an alternative to support. While the NEA & AFT are not thrilled with
       our "Ed-Flex" proposal, it does offer that alternative.
      Special Education. In appropriations and other battles, Republicans have essentially
       started a "special education first" mantra, creating the impression that they are not against
       education investments, they are just for different investments.

                                                 2
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
      Bilingual Education. Riggs bill, to be marked-up at full committee first or second week
       of June, will radically change bilingual education. Administration is opposed to the bill;
       POTUS will want to have an alternative on the table during the debate.

III. Other important issues to mention
      National Tests: we simply need to reiterate that this remains high priority for POTUS,
       and we will fight to get continued funding for it in appropriations.
      Reading Initiative: We will push for Congress to pass a bill before July I, so we can
       use $210 million advance appropriation before it is turned over to special education.
       While we are not enthused about the TAG provision (sort of an after-school tutoring
       voucher), it is drafted in a way that we can accept, and we hope NEAlAFT won't let it
       stand in the way of our getting a bill.
      Higher Education ActlMaster Teachers: POTUS will fight hard to prevent any damage
       to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. (In HEA, the High Hopes
       for College initiative and teacher training proposals are also of interest to NEAlAFT).

IV. Other issues that may come up:

      Charter School Legislation: Bipartisan legislation expanding current charter school
       program has passed the House and will be marked up in Senate in near future; neither
       AFT nor NEA support this legislation. No need to highlight this in the meeting.
      Workforce Development ActlG_I. Bill for America's Workers: A conference
       agreement may be on the President's desk by the end of June. We will fight any final
       language that would undermine school-to-work or vocational education.
