 This draft [above as attachment; below as text] closely tracks Larry
 Summer's testimony, as well as our own Q and A's.    I'd like to get it to
 EBB as soon as possible.   Thanks.

 Please note that the format is a little different than what we would give
 the President; EBB likes bullet points. The text version doesn't have the
 actual bullets, but you'll get the basic idea.

 CHIEF OF STAFF ERSKINE BOWLES
 TALKING POINTS FOR TOBACCO REMARKS
 CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY
 WASHINGTON, DC
 March 30, 1998

         Acknowledgments and Introduction: I want to start by thanking you for
 giving me the chance to speak to you today about what President Clinton is
 doing to protect our children from tobacco.

         I come from tobacco country, and I come before you today, as a North
 Carolinian, as a businessman, as a member of this administration, and as a
 parent, to tell you that protecting our children from tobacco is not about
 politics, and it is not about money -- it is about saving lives.

  Smoking kills more people every day than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents,
 murders, suicides, drugs and fires combined;

            Nearly 90% of smokers started smoking before they turned 18;

           More than 22% of high school students already smoke cigarettes on a
 daily basis;

  Every day, 3,000 young people will become regular smokers, and 1,000
 will die sooner as a result.

         At the same time, multi-million dollar marketing campaigns are designed
 to get our children to light their first cigarettes.  In the past months,
 new documents have come to light that conclusively prove that tobacco
 companies aimed to sell their deadly products to children as young as
 [12]. These documents are a shocking reminder that our children are under
 siege by a deadly and powerful enemy -- and it is up to us to protect them.

          The heavy human cost of smoking to our families and communities is tragic
  -- the economic cost to our society is shocking.



   Smoking related illness costs around $60 Billion every year;

   Smoking during pregnancy results in 2,500 fetal deaths every year, and
 costs $3 to $4 Billion every year;

              Fires caused by smokers cost another $500 Million every year;

   Smokers with group life insurance push up the premiums of non-smokers in
 their insurance pool by about $4 Billion every year
   The premature deaths and premature retirements of smokers cost around
 $60 Billion every year in lost wages and lower productivity

         President Clinton has proposed a comprehensive plan to stop young
 Americans from smoking before they start, by:

              Raising the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next
 ten years;
              Affirming the FDAD,s full authority to regulate tobacco products;
              Imposing strict restrictions on advertising aimed at young people,
              Assessing stiff penalties for selling cigarettes to minors.

         The Treasury Department has found that our proposal will save 1 million
 lives over the next five years.   Last week, Vice President Gore announ'ced
 that new estimates show that our proposal would have major effects on
 youth smoking in every state, with reductions ranging from 33% in
 washington State to 51% in Kentucky.

    For every dime added to the price of cigarettes, up to 700,000
 teenagers will begin smoking.

    Comprehensive tobacco sales and marketing restrictions will reduce'
 youth smoking by as much as 15%

          President ClintonD,s balanced budget protects our children and invests in
 our nationD,s future.    It includes:

   Unprecedented investments in education -- reducing class size, hiring
 100,000 more teachers, building or rehabilitating 5,000 more schools;

    Historic investments in child care -- providing child care to up to
  [xxx] working families;

   Critical investments in health research, including biomedical research,
 cancer clinical trials, and children's health outreach -- increasing by
 nearly 50% funding at the National Institutes of Health.

         President Clinton is committed to working with the Congress to make this
 the year that we took action to protect our children and to give them the
 care and education they need to reach their highest potential. But the
 Senate Republican budget would force us to choose between investing in our
 childrenD,s future and protecting their health.

    It would force medical research to compete for scarce dollars against
 children and education;

              It short changes working families by failing to subsidize child care;

   It fails to help us reduce class size, excluding important tax
 incentives to spur schools construction and hire 100,000 new teachers.



         The American people should not have to choose between their childrenD,s
 health and their childrenD,s education.  The PresidentD,s budget proves
 that we can do both.

         As we continue to work to protect the health of our children, we must
 also work to protect the well being of our nationD,s tobacco farmers.

   We are determined to make sure that the money realized from increasing
 the price of cigarettes will help benefit tobacco farmers and their
 communities;

    We support the efforts of Congress to help lessen the impact on tobacco
 farmers with tobacco production control programs;

    We will continue to work with tobacco farming organizations and public
 health groups to reach a consensus on the best way to proceed.

         We have it within our power right now to save one million lives, and we
 must not miss this historic opportunity.   As President Clinton recently
 said: D&Ne stand on the verge of one of the greatest public health
 achievements in history -- an historic triumph in our fight to protect
 AmericaD,s children from the deadly threat톙f tobacco.DB    I hope you will
 support our efforts, and I look forward to working together with you t톙
 meet this vitally important challenge.

           Thank you.
