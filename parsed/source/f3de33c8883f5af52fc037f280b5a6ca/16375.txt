                  Recommendations on Crack Cocaine Sentencing                   rs'on       m
                                          July 22, 1997

Announcement
    Today, the President stated that he had accepted a recommendation from the Attorney
     General and Drug Director to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine
     sentences from a ratio of 100 to 1, to a ratio of 10 to 1. Specifically, the
     recommendation calls for increasing the trigger for 5-year mandatory drug penalties from
     5 grams to 25 grams for crack cocaine -- and dropping the trigger from 500 to 250 grams
     for powder cocaine. The President has asked the Attorney General and Drug Director to
     consult and work with Members of Congress on this matter.

Background
     Current federal law requires a 5-year mandatory sentence for trafficking in 500 grams of
      powder cocaine, but imposes the same sentence for only 5 grams of crack cocaine.

      On May 1, 1995 the U.S. Sentencing Commission proposed equalizing penalties for crack
       and powder cocaine at 500 grams -- substantially reducing the penalties for crack.
       President Clinton proposed and signed legislation which rejected these recommendations
       and directed the Sentencing Commission to submit new recommendations that retained
       tougher sentences for crack ..

      On April 29th, the Sentencing Commission issued a revised report that proposed reducing
       the triggering amount for 5-year mandatory drug penalties for crack from the current 5
       grams to between 25 and 75 grams -- and decreasing this trigger for powder from the
       current 500 grams to between 125 and 375 grams.

      In response, the President asked the Attorney General and Drug Director to review the
       Sentencing Commission's recommendations and report back to him in 60 days. He also
       reiterated the Administration's position that -- while some adjustment to cocaine penalties
       is warranted -- our sentencing laws should continue to reflect that crack is a more
       dangerous form of cocaine and that tougher sentences are appropriate. Moreover, our
       cocaine sentencing policy should ensure that federal law enforcement resources target
       mid- and high-level drug traffickers.

      On July 3rd, the Attorney General and Drug Director recommended that the President
       support reducing the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences by: (1)
       increasing the trigger for 5-year mandatory drug penalties from 5 to 25 grams for crack;
       and (2) dropping the trigger from 500 to 250 grams for powder. This revised structure
       maintains tough sentences for serious drug offenders; properly focuses federal law
       enforcement efforts on mid- and high-level drug traffickers; addresses perceptions of
       unfairness with the current disparity; and continues to reflect that crack -- because it is
       more likely to be associated with violence -- is more a dangerous form of cocaine.
