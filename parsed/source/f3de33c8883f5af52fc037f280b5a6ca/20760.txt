Dear Senator:

       Thank you for sharing your concerns and your willingness to engage as a constructive
partner in the ongoing development of our agricultural labor policy and addressing any H2-A
program reforms.

         The Administration shares your goal of assuring that these policies achieve greater
stability in the agricultural workforce so that our agricultural producers and farm workers both
benefit.     Growers must have a more predictable and reliable labor supply, while we provide
adequate workplace protections for domestic and foreign farm workers who are among the
poorest and most vulnerable in our society.

        The Administration's guiding principles in reforming the H-2A program are designed
to create a system:

               where the procedures for using the program are simple and the least
                burdensome for growers;
               which assures an adequate labor supply for growers in a predictable and timely
                manner;
               that provides a clear and meaningful first preference for U.S. farm workers and
                a means for mitigating against the development of a structural dependency on
                foreign workers in an area or crop;
               which avoids the transfer of costs and risks from businesses to low wage
                workers;
               that encourages longer periods of employment for legal U.S. workers;
               which assures decent wages and working conditions for domestic and foreign
                farm workers, and that normal market forces work to improve wages, benefits,
                and working conditions.

I believe that if we are able to work within these principles, we will be able to achieve our
goals.

         The Departments of Agriculture and Labor have committed to work cooperatively to
 improve and enhance existing programs to meet the labor requirements of our vital agricultural
 industry, consistent with our obligations to American workers and producers, particularly, if
.efforts to halt illegal immigration contribute to agricultural labor shortages. In response to
 concerns regarding localized shortages, these Departments will work cooperatively to
 determine means of streamlining the current H2-A program to make it more responsive to
 agricultural producers and more effective in protecting U.S. workers.

       As a first step, the Administration has initiated a rule making process to streamline the

                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
the changes are in place for next year's growing season. In addition, in response tu the
growing concerns regarding the supply, adequacy and cost of migrant worker housing, we are
looking Administration-wide at alternatives available to address the issue.

       We recognize the need for reform of the H2-A program. We are eager to engage in
an inclusive, bi-partisan process involving all the major stakeholders to identify and craft
appropiate program reforms, possibly involving legislative changes. We are committed to
exploring innovative policy proposals, includirig provisions in your legislation which are
designed to increase program efficiency without sacrificing worker protections. We would like
to work with you in this spirit to accomplish appropriate reforms this year.

                                                  Sincerely,




Alexis M. Herman                                         Daniel Glickman
