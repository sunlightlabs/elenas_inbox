     Here's a rough summary of the CDF report for your use.  There's a lot in
     here -- some interesting, some junk, and ~lmost all with a 'glass half
     empty' spin. Many of the recommendations are consistent with initiatives
     we've already proposed and/or implemented.   We'll do a Q&A if this gets
     press attention in the a.m.

                         Welfare to What? Early Findings on Family Hardship and Well-Being
                                                 . December 2, 1998

             The report includes three sections: I) outcomes for former welfare recipients, 2) barriers to
             self-sufficiency experienced by families who have left welfare, and 3) promising practices
             adopted in some places and recommendations for policy and practice changes at the federal, state
             and community level. Some of these recommendations are issues we are well

             The report cites familiar data regarding dramatic caseload reductions, increases in the number of
             welfare recipients working, and some families being better off after leaving welfare. However,
             it concludes that caseload reductions are not sufficient measures of success, and that even for
             those working, work is often not sufficient to help a family achieve self-sufficiency. Among the
             reports findings:
                    low wages for most families leaving welfare;
                    the significant proportion of families who leave welfare without employment;
                    weak linkages with child care, Medicaid and food stamps which families are eligible for
                     after leaving welfare, but may not be receiving due to lack of information, poor outreach
                     efforts, and inappropriate practices in some states;
                    high rates of sanctioning in some states and evidence that sanctioned families may be
                     particularly disadvantaged; and
                    evidence that some families are experiencing hardship with food, housing, medial care,
                     and child care after leaving welfare.

             Most of these findings are based on previously released data, including state studies of welfare
             leavers, analysis of national survey data (including Census data), and reports by advocacy groups .
              .However, most of the information related to hardships for those leaving welfare relies heavily
             on informal surveys and new data collected by seven, local non-profit organizations in six states
             (MI, MN, PA, NY, KY, OH), as part of the National Welfare Monitoring and Advocacy
             Partnership. While evidence of increased hardship is important and should be monitored
             closely, these data reflect a small sample of families who were seeking emergency assistance
             from these non-profit organizations, including 250 people who were currently getting welfare, 65
             who stopped getting welfare in the last 6 months, and 142 who stopped getting either welfare,
             SSI or food stamps in the last 6 months. Over half of the responses came from a single
             community action agency in Louisville, KY. Thus, the hardship data raise serious
             methodological concerns.

             The report makes a strong pitch for increased federal and state investments that will help families
             moving from welfare to work, including child care, housing assistance, and vocational and
             post-secondary education, as well as increases in the minimum wage and more aggressive use of
             EITC to make work pay. In addition, the report recommends several policy changes related to
             more flexible use ofTANF block grant funds.
