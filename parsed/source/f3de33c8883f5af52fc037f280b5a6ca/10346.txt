Re:            Tobacco Company Profits

I attach a preliminary calculation of the impact of the tobacco settlement, and resultant price
increases, on tobacco company profitability. Taken at face value, the results are pretty stunning.

Overview

·       I estimate that the industry as a whole will make $71-$97 billion in excess profits over
        the next 25 years as a result oftheir settlement-induced price increases. Calculated in
        present value terms (which is the correct way to look at it), this amounts to $30 to $42
        billion over 25 years.

·       I find that the industry loses money in 1998, as the fixed payments that they make exceed
        the price increases to date. But they make money every year thereafter, with a steady
        state increase in profits of about $2.6 to $3.5 billion, or as much as 25 cents per
        pack.

·       These calculations are subject to considerable uncertainty:

               There is still some uncertainty in what I have seen over what the fixed payments
               are to the original four states.

               The settlement contains language which reduces the volume adjustment for 25%
               of excess profits, but it is not clear how well this can be enforced.

               I am working with list prices, and there may be promotions/discounts from those
               prices which reduce profitability. For example, much ofthe gains from the most
               recent 45 cent increase in price were returned to consumers through a holiday
               discount through the end of 1998

·       Moreover, it is a bit unfair to look at the industry as a whole, since Phillip Morris is the
        price-leader, and it makes less money because it has a higher share of fixed payments and
        higher profits per pack today (so more of a cost to lowering volume by raising prices) ..
        Even accounting for these, however, PM .doeS seem to increase profits as well.

·       In summary, it seems very clear that this package of settlement payments and price
        increases will lead to a sharp increase in the long run profitability of the industry

                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion



·      I first increase the price of cigarettes by the set of price increases announced over the past
       15 months by the tobacco industry - 26 cents in a series of steps before the latest 45 cent
       increase. Following Gary Black's analysis, I do not count 6 cents of the price increase
       because this is standard annual price increase. So, on net, the industry is raising prices
       65 cents more than they otherwise would because of the settlement.

·      For simplification, I call this 20 cents in 1998 and 45 cents in 1999, even though a bit of
       the 1998 increase came in 1997 and the 45 cent increase came at the end of 1998.

·      This calculation therefore assumes that prices will continue to increase to offset inflation
       - that is, the base price has just risen 65 cents, and will continue to rise thereafter to stay
       constant in real terms. This is consistent with history - if anything, cigarette prices have
       been rising in real terms.

·      This calculation also ignores any reaction of state taxes or retail margins. Increases in
       either could lead to further volume declines, which would feed back to the ultimate
       calculations through foregone profits. But this should be small.

Volumes

·      I use the standard Treasury model estimates ofthe price elasticity - a semi-log model with
       a price elasticity of -0.45 - to get the reduction in cig demand from this price increase.

Payments

·      Payments under the AG settlement, both fixed and volume adjusted, are clearly laid out in
       the settlement documents.

·      Payments under the four existing state settlements are less clear. I am working from two
       sources: Gary Black's reports and OMB's numbers. Both agree on the out-year stream
       of volume adjusted payments, so I've used OMB's numbers for the volume adjusted
       payments in each year. But Black has a much higher figure for the fixed payments than
       does OMB - he has fixed payments over the next five years of$8.8 billion, as opposed to
       $4.7 billion from OMB.

·      As a result, I have done two cases: one using Black's fixed payments, and one using
       OMB's. Columns 1-3 of the attached spreadsheet shows the payment streams - the
       Volume Adjusted Payments (VA), and the fixed payments using Black (GB) and OMB
       (OMB),

                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

·      An important component of costs is the fact that profits fall as prices rise and sales fall. I
       incoporate this at existing industry margins of 33 cents per pack.

Net Profit Impact

       Columns 4-5 of the spreadsheet show the net impact on profits, for the two different
       assumptions on fixed payments.

       In either case, there is a loss in the first year, as the price increase for 1998 (before the 45
       cent rise of last month) is not enough to make the fixed payments due this year. But
       there are gains in every other year.

       The gains in 1999 are particularly large, because the volume adjusted payments are small,
       and there is a dip down in fixed payments. I estimate that in 1999 the industry will make
       around $10 billion in excess profits from this price increase.

       The gains then get smaller, but remain quite large; they are about $3.5 billion per year in
       the out years

       The final two rows show 25 year totals and 25 year presented discounted values. These
       are huge in either case. I find that over 25 years the industry makes almost $100 billion
       in excess profits, with a present discounted value of around $40 billion.

Profit/pack

       Column (6) provides a rough check on the sensibility of these calculations by computing
       net profits per pack, for the Gary Black fixed costs case. In the out years, excess
       profits/pack are about 21 cents. This is sensible:

               Steady state volume adjusted payments are $9.4 billion. Since these are adjusted
               from a base of24 billion packs, this is 39 cents/pack.

               Steady state foregone profits are about $1 billion (33 cents per pack on roughly a
               3.3 billion pack decline in sales from baseline), which is about 42 cents/pack

               Prices are increasing by 65 cents, for a net gain of21.8 cents/pack.

               The difference between 21.8 and 20.7 (the figure in the spreadsheet) is the
               imperfect volume adjustment in the bill - firms only get credited 98% of decline in
               volume in their payments.

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

·      Exhibit E of the settlement, which describes the volume adjustment, has a provision that
       this adjustment shall be reduced by 25% of any increase in operating income of the
       industry from its base value. I don't know.if such a provision exists in the four state
       settlements - for now I assume that it does not.

·      It is unclear how well this can be enforced (see discussion below). But I do some
       calculations as well which assumes that it is perfectly enforced, so that I reduce the·
       amount of the AG volume adjustment by 25% of the net profit increase.

       These calculations are shown in columns 7-10 ofthe spreadsheet. For each of the two
       cases (GB and OMB), I first show the reduction in the volume adjustment due to excess
       profits, and then the resultant net profits after the 25% "tax".

       This adjustment lowers net profits significantly, but they are still huge - over $30 billion
       in net present value over 25 years.

Phillip Morris

       One reason why these profits are so large is the pricing dynamic in the industry: Phillip
       Morris sets the price and others follow. But, Phillip Morris is doing significantly worse
       under this settlement than are the other players in the market, for two reasons:

                 They pay a disproportionate share of fixed costs (68%, as opposed to only 42% of
                 volume adjusted costs)

                 They have a higher existing profit/pack, so declines in sales are more costly in
                 dollar terms

       The second spreads beet goes through analogous calculations for PM, and finds that they
       do indeed do worse - they get significantly less than 42% of the net profits from this price
       increase. Nevertheless, over the long run, they still make significant profits, of at least
       $7 billion in net present value.

Caveat

         These numbers are striking - a bit too striking. I am concerned that the Wall Street
         analysts aren't saying similar things. One difference could be promotions, which I do
         not incorporate. PM had a promotion through the end of this year which gave back to·
         retailers a large chunk of the gains from the 45 cent price increase. But this promotion
         is scheduled to end on January 3.

         I would like to check these calculations with someone like Gary Black before they were
         public in any form. We should discuss this.
