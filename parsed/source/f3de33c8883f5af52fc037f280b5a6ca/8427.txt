 DRAFT MEMORANDUM FOR EOP PRINCIPALS MEETING

 FROM:           ???

 SUBJECT:        BENCHMARKING THE NRC-BASED INCOME AND POVERTY
                 MEASURES

As discussed at the last EOP Principals meeting, in early 1999 the Census Bureau will publish an
analysis of alternative measures of poverty based on the proposals contained in the 1995 National
Research Council (NRC) report, Measuring Poverty: A New Approach. Because OMB is the
statutory arbiter of the "official" poverty measurement methodology, the Census Bureau has
asked for advice on the proposed alternative measures to be highlighted (among many that will
be published as part of the analysis). Currently, the Census Bureau plans to benchmark most of
its poverty estimates to a recent (likely 1997) poverty rate in order to highlight the changes that
result by moving to the new measure.

The purpose of this meeting is to decide whether we want to advise Census to highlight a few
series that are not benchmarked or advise them to only highlight benchmarked estimates. This
decision does not settle the issue of whether we should benchmark the official poverty measure,
but it would make selecting a non-benchmarked alternative more difficult.

In order to develop fully the issues involved, this memo has two parts. The first part explains
the concept and presents the pros and cons of benchmarking. Much of this information was
contained in the background memo for the last Principals meeting, however we include it here
for ease of access. The second part outlines the potential implications of advising the Census
Bureau to highlight some series that are not benchmarked.

Background on Benchmarking

  Poverty measurement involves two concepts: (1) a definition offamily resources, and (2) a
  "threshold" against which resources are compared to determine if a family is poor. The NRC
  panel recommends basing the threshold on expenditures on "necessities" (food, shelter, and
  clothing) plus a little more. However, the NRC panel cautioned that setting the level below
  which a family is considered poor is more of an art than a science. The panel therefore
  suggested a range of alternatives and left it to policymakers to determine the most appropriate
  levels. Specifically, the NRC panel recommends selecting the 30th to 35th percentile in the
  distribution of annual expenditures on food, shelter, and clothing among families of four (two
  adults and two children), and then multiplying this expenditure level by between 1.15 and 1.25 .
. Thresholds for other family sizes and types would be determined by an equivalency scale
  calculation.

Because there is some discretion in the setting of the poverty threshold, Table 1 shows poverty
rates between 1991 and 1996 using the current methodology (column 1) and using three
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                     2

alternative ways to detennine the threshold for the NRC experimental measure -- one
benchmarked and two not benchmarked:

       The "Benchmarked" measure is the NRC measure benchmarked to the 1996 poverty rate;
        in this case the thresholds are "backed out" by first setting the new aggregate poverty rate
        to the current rate and then setting the thresholds at the level that achieves this rate given
        the new resource definitions. In this case, the threshold falls to approximately the 25th
        percentile in the distribution of expenditures.
       The "NRC Experimental (midpoint)" (column 3) is based on selecting approximately the
        32.5 percentile in the distribution of annual expenditures and then multiplying this
        expenditure by approximately 1.2 -- the midpoints of the NRC recommendations;
       The "NRC Experimental (lower bound)" (column 4) is based on selecting the 30th
        percentile in the distribution of annual expenditures and then multiplying this expenditure
        by 1.15 -- the lower bound of the NRC recommendations;

Both the NRC Experimental "midpoint" and "lower bound" estimates would not match the
current overall poverty rate and thus would be considered "not benchmarked."

 While benchmarking assures that the aggregate poverty rate is identical for the official and the
 alternative measure in the benchmarked year, the distribution of poverty among subgroups within
 each measure does change. (see Table 2). In general, working families and families with large
.out-of-pocket medical expenses would more likely be measured as poor, and nonworking
 families with substantial in-kind benefits would less likely be measured as poor. This would
 have geographic as well as subgroup poverty rate implications. For example, even though the
 relative proportion of poor who are Black declines under both alternatives (not shown in Table
 2), the estimated Black poverty rate falls with benchmarking but rises or stays constant with a
 non-benchmarked measure. Similarly, both historical and future trends would differ. For
 instance, the benchmarked measure would be identical to the current rate in 1996 but higher in
 1991. (The faster fall using the alternative measure is largely due to the expansion in the EITC.)

Pros and Cons of Benchmarking and Not Benchmarking

Pros o/benchmarking:
      May provide an easier transition to the new official measure of poverty because there will
       not be a change in the overall level of poverty. (Critics, of course, will still charge that
       this level is arbitrary.) In addition, with a benchmarked measure it may be easier to
       implement changes in the poverty guidelines issued by HHS for program purposes.

       Focuses the arguments on the relative distribution of who is poor rather than on how
        many people are poor; experts would say that the results on the distribution of who is
        poor are more objective and scientific than those on the total number of poor.

Cons 0/ benchmarking:
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                     3

       Violates the NRC recommendation that the threshold should be based on the 30th-35th
        percentile in the expenditure distribution. In order to"benchmark, the threshold falls to
        about the 25th percentile of expenditures on food, shelter, and clothing. This may cost
        us the political cover of following a nonpartisan expert panel, and may raise questions of
        motive.

       Will highlight the distributional consequences of moving to an NRC-based alternative
        more clearly than under the non-benchmarked alternatives (although both have
        distributional consequences); for instance the poverty rate for some groups would fall in
        absolute terms with benchmarking.

       There is a perceived illogic in using an overall poverty rate from a method we say is
        flawed to determine a key part of a methodology we say is better.

 Pros of not benchmarking:
       Incorporates the recommendations of the NRC panel, based on their professional
       judgement from the best available evidence (though, as noted, this judgement is
        subjective), and therefore provides some limited political cover.

 Cons of not benchmarking:
      Results in a higher poverty rate (although the trends over time are similar.)

. Key Decision for this Meeting

 There are basically two options: (1) Advise the Census Bureau to highlight some
 non-benchmarked estimates along with benchmarked estimates; or (2) Advise the Census Bureau
 to highlight only benchmarked estimates.

 Pros of advising the Census Bureau to highlight some non-benchmarked estimates
       Keeps the option of non-benchmarked estimates in the public dialog, which may preserve
        the option of not benchmarking when and if we decide to move to a new official measure
        of poverty.

       Narrowing the range of options in any dimension may be perceived as moving us closer
        to a final decision, and might limit our flexibility.

       The Census report may appear more credible if it includes a non-benchmarked
        alternative, given that the NRC's recommendation did not involve benchmarking.

       Ifwe decide to change to an NRC-based measure as the official measure of poverty and if
        we decide to benchmark the official measure, it may make the change look small
        compared to selecting the non-benchmarked alternative. It gives us an ability to look
        "reasonable" by adopting a less extreme change.

                                                                                                 4


Cons ofadvising the Census Bureau to highlight some non-benchmarked estimates
     Even if we're not certain that we want to change the official measure of poverty, we may
      be held accountable for estimates that poverty is really higher than the current rate.

      Even if the non-benchmarked estimates are simply among those highlighted, people could
       focus on them and create an "uproar." Alternatively, some of our traditional allies may
       like the non-benchmarked estimates and feel abandoned should we ultimately choose to
       benchmark.

Pros ofadvising the Census Bureau to highlight only benchmarked estimates
      It may raise less of a political "uproar." This would be particularly valuable if we
       believe we are likely to benchmark any new official measure anyway.

Cons of advising the Census Bureau to highlight only benchmarked estimates
     It may make it more difficult not to benchmark in the future.

      If Census does not closely follow the NRC recommendation, it may appear that they had
       been inappropriately influenced by political considerations, particularly since
       non-benchmarked estimates are already in the public domain.
