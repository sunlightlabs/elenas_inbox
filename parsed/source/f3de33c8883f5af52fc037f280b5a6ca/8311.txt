    PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT GORE ANNOUNCE NEW INITIATIVES TO
     IMPROVE HEALTH FOR CHILDREN AND OLDER AMERICANS AT FAMILY REUNION
              CONFERENCE HOSTED BY VICE PRESIDENT AND MRS. GORE
                                  June 22, 1998

Today, at the seventh Family Reunion Conference in Tennessee hosted by Vice President and Mrs. Gore,
the President and Vice President announced a series of new initiatives to improve health for older
Americans and children, and to make the health care system more responsive to the needs of families.

Children: issued an Executive Memorandum that directs eight Federal agencies to implement over 150
new initiatives to help enroll the miIIions of uninsured children eligible for but not enrolled in health
insurance programs; Older Americans: developed a multi-faceted national health initiative for older
Americans, which includes: new preventive benefits for Medicare beneficiaries; a national Internet site;
and a new nationwide public/private National Medicare Alliance Network with over 80 organizations to
ensure older Americans have the information they need to select health plans and encourage prevention
and wellness; Families: renewed the call on Congress to pass a patients' biII of rights.

CHILDREN: SIGNED EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE TO IMPLEMENT OVER 150 NEW
FEDERAL COMMITMENTS TO ENROLL ELIGIBLE BUT UNINSURED CHILDREN. Over 4
miIIion uninsured children are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid, and as the new Children's Health
Insurance Program is implemented, even more families will have children who are eligible for state or
federal health insurance programs. Today, the President signed an Executive Memorandum that cuts
across jurisdiction and traditional agency inflexibility by directing eight Federal agencies -- ranging from
HUD to SSA to the Education Department -- to implement over 150 new Federal initiatives to help sign
up the millions of uninsured children eligible for but not enrolled in health insurance programs. This
action illustrates how a responsive and flexible government can meet the evolving needs of families. The
initiatives include:

       Sending letters to 350,000 federal workers, including Head Start teachers, school nurses,
        child support workers, and community health center directors asking them to ensure that all of
        the families they work with whose children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP are enrolled in these
        programs.

       Working With National Organizations and Programs That Reach Millions of Families to
        Help Enroll Children in Health Insurance Programs, including educating grandparents through
        the Medicare program, holding a conference with Historically Black Colleges to identify new
        strategies, and ensuring that sites, including 15,000 public housing projects, 400 IRS walk-in
        centers, and 113 job centers, have information for families about how to enroll children in health
        insurance.

       Releasing a New Guide to Help Child Care Workers Enroll Uninsured Children. Child c..are
        centers are one family-friendly setting where parents can learn about insurance programs they may
        be eligible for. There are already many efforts underway to link child care centers with the health
        needs of the miIIions of children in child care. Today, the Department of Health and Human
        Services is releasing a new child care handbook "Child Care and Medicaid: Partners for Healthy
        Children" to ensure that child care workers understand how to identify and enroll families with
        uninsured children.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
OLDER AMERICANS: ANNOUNCED NEW NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE HEALTH
OF OLDER AMERICANS. One ofthe greatest concerns for families is the health of older family
members. Today, the President and Vice President:

     Implemented Historic New Preventive Benefits for Medicare Beneficiaries. The President
      and Vice President announced that starting July 1st, for the first time, Medicare will cover two
      critical preventive benefits -- bone mass measurement tests to detect osteoporosis and diabetes
      education. The President signed into law these new benefits -- as well as a series of preventive
      benefits to detect cancer, which were implemented earlier this year -- as part of the historic
      Balanced Budget Act of 1997. These benefits underscore how Medicare is trying to encourage
      better health outcomes for families.

     Launched a New Internet Site for Medicare Beneficiaries. Families need good information to
      help make the best health care decisions for older family members. Today, the President and Vice
      President launched a new nationwide Internet site (Medicare.gov) so that families can understand
      the options and services Medicare provides. This information will be even more critical as the
      historic changes the President enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 are
      implemented this fall. These reforms give beneficiaries new plan choices that will improve care
      for older Americans, but also have the potential to cause confusion.

     Created a Nationwide Public/Private Medicare Education Alliance Network, including over
      80 National Organizations, to Ensure Families Are Informed Health Care Consumers. The
      President and Vice President announced that over 80 organizations, including the AFL-CIO,
      American Association of Retired Persons, Older Women's League, National Rural Health
      Association, and American Association of Family Physicians, are joiningwith the Health Care
      Financing Administration, Administration on Aging, and National Institutes of Health to launch a
      new National Medicare Alliance Network that will work to ensure that families have the
      information they need to make critical health decisions including: ensuring that Medicare
      beneficiaries learn of the new preventive benefits and other prevention and wellness strategies;
      understand new plan options so they can select the health plan that best meets their needs; and
      know the consumer protections available under Medicare.

FAMILIES: MAKING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS
OF FAMILIES

     Renewing Call on Congress to Pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. The President also urged
      Congress to stop delaying and pass a patients' bill of rights to ensure that all families have the
      patient protections they need in a rapidly changing health care system. This patients' bill of rights
      should contain a range of protections, including guaranteed access to needed health care
      specialists, access to emergency room services when and where the need arises, and access to a
      meaningful internal and external appeals process for consumers to resolve their differences
      with their health plans and health care providers.
