MEMORANDUM FOR                 ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:                          GENE SPERLING
                               BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:                       "Choice" No-Fault Auto Insurance

Both you and the President independently asked us to look into whether the "choice" no-fault
auto insurance plan devised by Jeffrey O'Connell and Michael Horowitz, supported by Senator
Dole in last year's election, and now proposed for implementation in New Jersey by Governor
Whitman might be something we would think a good idea as a matter of policy. Our
preliminary response is that the Administration should not reject the plan out of hand -- it has
positive features, including some that go beyond premium reduction, that suggest a closer policy
look is appropriate. During the 1970s, the Carter Administration supported national no-fault.
There is still staff at Commerce and DOT who were part of that effort and have some expertise
in the field. Before deciding to pursue any form of no-fault, we should bring these agencies into
the process.

What is no-fault?

No-fault auto insurance is essentially first party coverage: if you're injured in an auto accident,
your carrier pays for your injuries I and your right to sue the other party (ifthere is one) is either
non-existent ("pure" no-fault) or circumscribed. Almost all no-fault policies get their savings
from the fact that only economic damages are covered -- no pain and suffering. No state has
pure no fault. Depending on how you count, about 13 states and Puerto Rico have some form of
no-fault. In New York and Michigan, which have tough verbal thresholds to get into court, it is
reasonably effective in holding down costs and keeping cases out of court (although New York
premiums are high for other reasons). In other states, with weak verbal or dollar thresholds, or a
right to choose to litigate after an accident, it has been less effective.

"Choice" no-fault is a system under which drivers would be given the option of choosing either a
pure no-fault policy with fairly high policy limits (e.g., $250,000) but no access to court or a
more expensive policy which allowed court access but in which the policy-holder's insurance
company would -- as is the case with uninsured motorist coverage today -- pay, no matter who
was at fault. Governor Whitman has proposed a variation of this system. There would be four


       I   Much auto property damage (to the auto) is covered by collision insurance. Some
states once experimented with broader no-fault for property damage, but it was neither very
effective nor very efficient. It is generally not an issue in the debate.

policies: pure no-fault at the $250,000 level (which would have a premium reduction of
20-25%); pure no-fault with a pain and suffering add-on, but on a first party basis (which would
result in a premium reduction of about 8%); no-fault but with access to court with a high verbal
threshhold (reduction unstated but should be some); and the traditional second-party liability
system with unfettered access to court.

Problems and opportunities

The usual rationale for moving to no-fault is that it drives down insurance premiums, and the
usual response is that it unfairly keeps injured parties from exercising their constitutional right to
access to court. A collateral argument is that first party systems "punish" both good drivers and
bad drivers who get into accidents, whereas the current system places the burden on the bad
driver. This set of arguments does not tell the whole story.

       Flaws in the Argument in Favor

Theoretically, no-fault should reduce automobile insurance premiums. A 1996 study by the
Rand Institute for Civil Justice concluded that pure no-fault would reduce personal injury
premiums by about 60%, and total premiums -- after taking into account the 50% of the typical
premium that is for property coverage -- by about 30%. There are several reasons this has not
been borne out in practice in the states that have adopted no-fault, and some additional reasons
why certain states .are likely to benefit less in any event.

              As noted above, no state has pure no-fault. Where there are weak verbal
               threshholds or dollar threshholds, not only do cases continue to get to court, but
               there is pressure to inflate medical expenses to go over the limits.
              While legal costs are a significant part of the premium dollar, other costs are
               important too in determining how fast premiums go up, such as the rate of
               increase in medical costs (leaving aside any impact of no-fault on these costs).
               Moreover, automobile insurance is a competitive business in most states and
               insurance companies regularly cycle through periods of declining and rising
               premiums.
              In states with a very high proportion of single-car accidents -- i.e., most rural
               states -- no-fault does not change the complexion of the payout system, and
               therefore should not have much effect on premiums. You can't sue a tree. Rand
               claims that the proportion of uninsured motorists doesn't matter much, but admits
               they don't really know.
              Even Rand, generally supportive of no-fault, admits that the most seriously
               injured individuals will probably get less compensation than under the current
               system. (The least seriously injured will cease being overcompensated.)

            Additional benefits from no-fault

     Even if there were no premium reduction, however, no-fault might have other benefits:

                   As a medical matter, people who are injured who receive high quality medical and
                    rehabilitative treatment quickly are more likely to recover fully. By keeping
                    cases out of court, no-fault reduces the temptation to keep the plaintiff injured for
                    the jury. Moreover, it provides the money to get the rehabilitation that's needed.
                   This was important in the 1970s, but probably has gotten even more important
                    since because:
                           Fewer people have medical insurance today; and
                           Seatbelt and airbags save lives, but those saved are often severely injured.
                   High verbal threshold no-fault probably reduces fraud in the medical care system,
                    and should reduce volume pressures on the civil justice system.

            Flaws in the Opposition

     The part of the argument in opposition that is stated in constitutional terms is basically
     unanswerable, except to note that in general not everyone has access to the civil justice system
     because ofthe cost and time involved in using the system. (The efforts of Republicans to get rid
     of contingency fees and institute loser pays would, of course, exacerbate this problem, and
     undoubtedly no-fault's opponents will lump any support on our part with these changes we
     oppose.) Portions of their argument relating to the lack of reduction in premiums in no-fault
     states or the fact that many rural states have much lower premiums than no-fault states ignore the
     different economics of the states and/or the problems related to low threshholds, but clearly need
     to be taken into account in determining the practical real-life impact of adopting no-fault.
