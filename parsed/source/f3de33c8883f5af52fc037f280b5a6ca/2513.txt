This is what I'm giving to Gene for him to review (along with your

document) .

I prepared it in a way such that if you guys went ahead with yours, this

would

complement it (or contradict it, depending on how you look at it).    My

view is

that it would be best to be late and have something that is joint NEC-DPC,

but

I can't say yet when Gene will be ready for that.
