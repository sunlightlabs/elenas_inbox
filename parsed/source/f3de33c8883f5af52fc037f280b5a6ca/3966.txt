TEXT:
Attached is a partial draft for the education pillar.   Tanya and I met
with Jon Kaplan this afternoon, and, as you will see, towards the bottom
there are holes for several items that NEC plans to submit as "building
blocks." We should have them in the morning and will pass them along as
soon as we do (Bob Shireman was going to do several and fax them in) .
Some things I want to highlight:

 1. Mike was out all day and at a ballgame tonight, so this represents zero
 input from him. We did get him the documents you handed out this morning.

2. Kaplan mentioned that one of the building blocks that Gene wanted was
"2 years of preschool universal."   I want to make sure that this meshes
with whatever you and the others working on early childhood/childcare for
DPC have in mind.

3. There are two items here that haven't been much vetted, or vetted at
all, internally --a) the Urban/Fixing Failing Schools entry (talked a lot
about conceptually, but not sure how much you have seen on this and
struggled with how to deal with both Obey funds and FY 99 initiative that
ED is developing), and b) the Safe and Drug Free schools one. ED is
considering proposing to put a big chunk of the money for the program into
state-level competitions (now its basically formula), and perhaps
directing more of the money to safety.  I'll show to Leeanne/Jose in the
a.m., and see what they think.

4. So far there is nothing on school construction, and don't know if we
will get from NEC.

Thanks.
