                                               October 23, 1997

          Over the past decade, the number ofAmerican families with working parents has
    expanded dramatically. Making high quality child care more affordable and accessible is
    critical to the strength of our families and to healthy child development and learning..... Each
    ofus --from businesses to reiigious leaders to policy-makers and elected officials --has a
    responsibility and an important stake in making sure that children ofall ages have the best
    possible care available to them. From infancy through adolescence, in child care settings
    and after-school programs, children can learn and thrive with the right care, attention, and
    education.
                                                                   -- President Clinton, July 23, 1997


       President Clinton is hosting the first-ever White House Conference on Child Care to focus the
nation's attention on the importance of addressing the need for safe, affordable, quality child care.
This Conference underscores and builds upon the President Clinton's commitment to strengthen the
American family by giving parents the tools they need to fulf'ill their responsibilities and giving
children the ability to reach their full potential.


STRENGTHENING AMERICA'S WORKING FAMILIES

         Putting Families First. Throughout his presidency, President Clinton has worked hard to help
          America's working families. That is why the President fought for the passage of the Family
          and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to allow workers to take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave to care
          for a newborn or adopted child, to attend to their own serious health needs, or to care for a
          seriously ill parent, child or spouse. In June 1996, President Clinton proposed expanding
          FMLA to allow workers to take up to 24 unpaid hours off each year for school and early
          childhood education activities, routine family medical care, and caring for an elderly relative.
          The President also has fought for greater health security for America's families. He signed
          into law the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act which includes important new
          protections for an estimated 25 million Americans who move from one job to another, who are
          self-employed, or who have pre-existing medical conditions. And in August 1997, President
          Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act which included $24 billion for the Children's Health
          Initiative -- the single largest investment in health care for children since 1965 -- to provide
          meaningful health care coverage to millions of uninsured children.

         Providing Economic Opportunity. In 1993, President Clinton put into place an economic
          strategy that invests in people and provides real opportunity. President Clinton has fought for
          policies that help working parents fulfill their responsibilities, including winning inclusion of a
          $500 per-child tax credit for children under age 17 in the Balanced Budget Act -- helping 27
          million families with 45 million children. The new Child Tax Credit is in addition to the
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

     Eamed Income Tax Credit and the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (tax credits President
     Clinton protected during the balanced budget negotiations). President Clinton also expanded
     the Eamed Income Tax Credit to give 15 million working families tax relief. In 1997, the
     average tax credit is $1,450 on family income up to $29,290. And the President proposed
     and signed into law an increase in the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15. For a full-time,
     year-round worker at minimum wage, this 90-cent increase raises yearly income by $1,800 -- as
     much as the average family spends on groceries over seven months.


INVESTING IN CHILD CARE

    Increasing Child Care Funding. Because of President Clinton's leadership, federal funding
     for direct child care subsidies has increased by nearly 70 percent since he took office, providing
     child care services for over one million children. The 1996 welfare law increased child care
     funding by $4 billion over six years, providing child care assistance to low-income working
     families and parents moving from welfare to work.

    Increasing Participation in Head Start and Improving Program Quality. For more than
     thirty years, Head Start has been one of our nation's best investments ensuring that low-income
     children start school ready to leam. President Clinton has made expanding and improving
     Head Start a priority of his Administration. Since 1993, funding for the program has increased
     by 43 percent -- in fiscal year 1997, Head Start will serve nearly 800,000 low-income children
     four years old and younger. The Balanced Budget continues the expansion of Head Start
     toward the President's goal of serving one million children in 2002. Over the last three years,
     the Clinton Administration has also invested significantly in improving program quality,
     providing local programs with the resources they need to attract and retain high quality
     teachers, and ensuring the safety of Head Start centers.

    Created Early Head Start for 0-3 Year Olds. Initiated by the President in 1994, there are
     now 143 Early Head Start programs across the country, expanding the proven benefits of Head
     Start to low-income families with children age three and under. The program provides early,
     continuous and comprehensive child development and family support services, preparing
     children for a lifetime of learning and development. 'In FY 1997, the program will have served
     nearly 25,000 children and their families.

    Developed a Full-Day, Full-Year Head Start Initiative. In March 1997, the Administration
     announced a new Head Start initiative that will expand Head Start services for children while
     also helping parents, including those moving from welfare to work. Under the new initiative,
     child care providers will be given priority for Head Start expansion funds to deliver full-day,
     full-year Head Start services in partnership with Head Start. Children will stay in one place all
     day rather than attending Head Start for half a day then moving to child care for the remainder
     ofthe day.

   Expanding Child Care in Rural America. Under the Clinton Administration, the
    Agriculture Department's Rural Housing Service's Community Facilities program is directing
    its efforts towards meeting the need for quality child care in rural areas. As a part of this effort,
    31 child care centers were created in FY 1997 and the program will expand in FY 1998. In
    addition, the Rural Housing Service has been forming partnerships with other federal programs
    (including Head Start) and the private sector to help provide child care in rural America.

   Providing Child Care in Urban Communities. Under the Clinton Administration, the
    Department of Housing and Urban Development is supporting working families and those
    moving to work by providing both quality child care for their children and opportunities for
    parents to become self sufficient. Community Development Block Grants fund initiatives that
    include education/training opportunities, on-site after-school child care and construction of child
    care and youth centers. The Ounce of Prevention Program enhances efforts already underway
    in Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities with summer and after-school
    education/recreation activities and mentoring and tutoring programs. In 1997, the Department
    awarded $550 million in urban revitalization (HOPE VI) funds which will be used to
    physically revitalize communities and fund initiatives such as on-site day care centers and
    transportation services that provide access to employment centers and health care facilities. In
    1997, the Administration funded $42 million for the Family Economic Development and
    Supportive Services (EDSS) program that will include child care services, youth leadership and
    mentoring skills and family/parental development counseling.

   Serving Children with Special Needs. Under the Clinton Administration, the Department of
    Justice has worked hard to make sure that children with disabilities have access to child care
    along with non-disabled children. For instance, the Justice Department has entered into
    agreements regarding children with disabilities with the two largest child care companies in the
    country -- KinderCare has agreed to do "finger-prick" tests as requested by doctors and parents
    for children with diabetes and, in another agreement with KinderCare, the company has agreed
    to develop a model policy to enable a child with mental retardation to attend one of its centers
    with a state-funded personal care attendant. In addition, La Petite Academy has agreed to do the
    same "finger-prick" tests, to keep epinephrine on hand for severe and possibly-life-threatening
    allergy attacks, and to make changes to some of its programs so that children with cerebral
    palsy can participate. The Justice Department also provides information through its ADA
    information hotline (1-800-514-0301, 1-800-514-0383 TDD) and produces Commonly Asked
    Questions about Child Care Centers and the ADA for distribution. Additionally, the HHS
    Child Care Bureau has launched a special initiative to assist ten states to develop and
    implement effective plans aimed at improving and expanding their child care service delivery
    system. The project, "Map to Inclusive Child Care," will expand to other states over the next
    three years.

   Easing the Commuting Dilemma for Families. The President is fighting for
    welfare-to-work transportation grants to assist states and local communities in moving
    individuals from welfare-to-work -- including helping parents with small children obtain
    transportation to their jobs and to child care. Proposed legislation is included in the
    transportation authorization bills currently before Congress. In addition, as a part of


                                                 3.
                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
     the Transportation Department's Livable Communities Initiative, the Federal Transit
     Administration (FTA) has provided opportunities for on-site community services -- Head
     Start facilities, a health clinic, and child care centers -- at transit facilities across the
     country to help parents obtain child care for their children on their commuting routes to
     work or training.


ENSURING HEALTH AND NUTRITION IN CHILD CARE

    Improving Health and Safety with Healthy Child Care America. In an effort to improve the
     health and safety of child care programs and to provide child health education to child care
     providers and parents, in 1995, the Clinton Administration launched the Healthy Child Care
     America initiative. This effort has established partnerships between child care providers and
     health care services in 46 states, helping to ensure that children in child care are in safe and
     healthy environments.

    Ensuring that Children in Child Care Settings Are Properly Immunized. In July 1997,
     President Clinton proposed new child care regulations to ensure that children in child
     care receive the immunizations they need on time~ The proposed rule would require that
     all children in federally subsidized child care be immunized according to state public
     health agency standards. This proposed regulation will particularly affect those children
     in child care arrangements that are legal but exempt from state licensing requirements.

    Providing Quality Nutrition to Children in Child Care. President Clinton has maintained
     the commitment to providing quality nutrition in the Child and Adult Care Food Program
     (CACFP), a federal program that provides healthy meals and snacks in child and adult day care
     facilities. In 1997, the program provided meals to about 2.5 million children and almost
     50,000 adults in approximately 35,000 child care centers (including after-school centers),
     195,000 family and group day care homes, and 1,500 adult day care centers. Child care
     providers in the CACFP must serve meals that meet federal nutrition guidelines, and must offer
     free or reduced-price meals to those eligible. The General Accounting Office identified
     CACFP as one of the most effective vehicles for reaching family child care providers and
     enhancing the care they provide because of its unique combination of resources, training,
     oversight and peer support. Notably, 87 percent offamily child care homes that are considered
     to be providing good quality child care are participating in the Child and Adult Care Food
     Program, according to the Families and Work Institute's Study afChildren in Family Child
     Care and Relative Care.


CARING FOR SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN

    Convened the 1997 School-Age Child Care Forums. The Child Care Bureau at the
     Department of Health and Human Services convened ten regional conferences to share
     promising initiatives for school-age children among child care, education, and community
     based organizations from nearly every state. These conferences spurred additional dialogue
     among participants and stimulated planning to address "out of school time" in states and

    communities across the country.

   Keeping Schools Open as Community Learning Centers -- A Guide. In May 1997, First
    Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton released Keeping Schools Open as Community Learning
    Centers: Extending Learning in a Safe, Drug-Free Environment Before and After School. The
    Department of Education, along with the National Community Education Association, Policy
    Studies Associates, and the American Bar Association, wrote the step-by-step guidebook on
    how school facilities can be used for after-school programs.

   Providing After-School Actiyities Through 21st Century Learning Centers and Title L The Clinton
    Administration's Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 reauthorized the Elementary and
    Secondary Education Act. This law included a new statutory requirement that encourages
    schools receiving funding to enhance their instruction with such programs as extended school
    years, before- and after-school programs, and summer programs -- effectively giving "teeth" to
    after-school options. For instance, Title I -- which is funded by the Improving America's
    Schools Act and provides extra help with basic and advanced skills to disadvantaged students in
    elementary and secondary schools -- has been successful in helping Title I funded schools
    provide after-school programs. In addition, under this law, the 21st Century Community
    Learning Center program has been developed -- a program that once fully implemented will
    benefit urban and rural schools and their communities, allowing schools to stay open beyond
    the normal hours, offering expanded learning opportunities to children after-school. The
    President's current budget request includes $50 million to fund 350 21st Century Community
    Learning Center programs in FY 1998.

   Supporting Positive After-School.Choices with the Safe and Drug-Free Schools
    Communities Act. Because children unsupervised after school are more likely to engage in
    risky behaviors like substance use, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act funds
    before and after-school programs. In the 1994-95 school year, over 2,700 school districts used
    these funds to support before- and after-school activities.

   Staying Safe After School with Community Schools.           In the Anti-Gang and Youth Violence
    Initiative, the President has called for 1,000 new after-school initiatives across the country.
    Schools that stay open longer and are open on weekends and during the summer can provide
    students, parents and communities with access to valuable resources. Turning schools into
    after-hour safe havens can help to prevent violent crime and violent behavior while boosting
    our children's academic achievement.

   Helping Children Through Service. As co-chair of the Presidents' Summit for America's Future,
    President Clinton helped bring businesses, nonprofits, states and communities, and volunteer
    groups to Philadelphia in April 1997 to focus on service and to ensure that every child in
    America has five key resources -- a caring adult, a safe place, a healthy start, a marketable skill,
    and a chance to serve. Many of the hundreds of corporations and nonprofits that made
    commitments at the summit pledged to become involved in after-school and mentoring
    programs. America's Promise, the nonprofit organization founded to follow up on the summit
    promises, is now working with these organizations to ensure that they do so.

    Enhancing Child Care and After-School Care with the Corporation for National Service.
     Established by President Clinton in 1993, the Corporation for National Service, through
     AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America and the National Senior Service Corps, is addressing the
     needs of children through service activities. Approximately two-thirds of the national service
     programs work to address the needs of children and youth often in child care and after-school
     settings. AmeriCorps members, college students, and senior volunteers, working alongside
     child care providers, are serving as tutors and mentors, health and nutrition educators, in both
     child care and after-school programs across the country.

    Aiding the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. The Clinton Administration is providing
     resources to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America to establish and enhance more clubs
     throughout the United States. These Clubs are situated in at-risk communities and reach
     thousands of kids through violence prevention and reduction, educational health programs and
     youth leadership development. For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America was
     awarded an AmeriCorps grant to provide education awards to 100 full-time and 800 part-time
     AmeriCorps members in up to 100 clubs early next year. The AmeriCorps members will be
     either older (17 and 18 year-olds) Boys or Girls Clubs members or club member alumni who
     will serve as tutors, mentors, and recreation activity coordinators in after-school programs.


PROVIDING INFORMATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

    Providing Child Care Information. In 1995, the Clinton Administration established the
     Child Care Bureau at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to streamline child
     care program operations and improve the quality and efficiency of service. In addition, HHS
     launched the National Child Care Information Center to disseminate child care information,
     publications and resources to help providers start up child care centers, parents locate child care
     in their communities, and researchers and policy makers attain access to policy information.
     Through the Technical Assistance Project, HHS has brought states together to share promising
     practices and has held special forums on school-age care, consumer education, Tribal child care
     programs, and a range of other topics.

    Promoting Public/Private Partnerships. The Child Care Bureau has launched a nationwide
     effort to promote public/private partnerships in child care by providing technical assistance to
     states on promising initiatives going on across the country.

    Providing a Resource and Referral Clearinghouse for Working Families. The Department
     of Labor Women's Bureau recently published a report entitled: What Works! The Working
     Women Count Honor Roll Final Report which highlights employers who have made real
     change in the areas that working women and their families care about most -- pay and benefits,
     family friendly workplaces (including child care) and respect and fair treatment on the job.
     Hundreds of employers accepted this challenge to deliver real change -- especially in child care.
      This guide was a result of the Working Women Count national questionnaire which surveyed

                                                 6.
                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

     250,000 working women -- the largest questionnaire of working women ever. Notably, child
     care was identified as a top issue for working women. In addition to this guide, the Labor
     Department has expanded its resource and referral clearinghouse for employers and working
     families. The agency has established a toll-free number (1-800-827-5335) and provides
     materials like the Work and Family Resource Kit and Care Around the Clock: Developing
     Child Care Before 9 and after 5.

    Training Caregivers -- a Nationally Acclaimed Program. The Education Department's
     Office of Educational Research and Improvement supports the regional laboratory in San
     Francisco, California called WestEd. WestEd has developed a nationally acclaimed
     Infant/Toddler Caregiver Training Program which teaches caregivers how to provide nurturing
     and stimulating environments to promote quality child care. Research-based videos and
     printed materials are available in Spanish, Chinese, and English. Eight thousand caregivers
     have been trained in California and the program has been expanded across the nation.


LEARNING LESSONS FROM THE MILITARY CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

    Providing High Quality Child Care -- The Military Model. Under the Clinton
     Administration, the Department of Defense (DoD) has made important strides to improve the
     quality of child care for the children of the men and women who serve our country. The DoD
     Child Care System serves over 200,000 children (age zero to 12) daily making the U.S. military
     system the largest employer-sponsored child care program in the nation. The DoD Child Care
     System, known as the Child Development Program, includes Child Development Centers,
     Family Child Care homes, School Age Care programs, and Resource and Referral services.
     Through this system, the military offers full-day, part-day, and hourly child care, part-day
     preschools, before- and after-school programs for school age children, and extended hour care
     which includes nights and weekends to accommodate shift workers. Because of the
     Department of Defense's commitment to excellence in child care, since 1992, the number of
     military child care facilities that are accredited by the independent National Association for the
     Education of Young Children has risen from 55 to 353. Currently, over 75 percent of military
     child care programs are accredited, as compared to only 7 percent of other child care facilities
     nationwide. Since the early 1990s, the DoD has focused on improving the quality, availability,
     and cost of child care for military families.

    Sharing the Military's Expertise. Because ofthe DoD's high quality, comprehensive child
     care programs, in April 1997, President Clinton directed the Secretary of Defense to share the
     expertise and lessons learned from the Military Child Development Programs with Federal,
     State, tribal, and local agencies, as well as with private and nonprofit groups, that are
     responsible for providing child care. In his Directive the President stated, "The Military Child
     Development Programs have attained a reputation for an abiding commitment to quality in the
     delivery of child care. The Department of Defense's dedication to adequate funding, strict
     oversight, improved training and wage packages, strong family child care networks, and
     commitment to meeting national accreditation standards is laudatory. I believe that the military
     has important lessons to share with the rest of the Nation on how to improve the quality of child
     care for all of our Nation's children." In response to the President's directive, the Pentagon is


                                                 7.

     implementing a plan to reach out to states and civilian child care centers to share its expertise.


SUPPORTING A FAMILY-FRIENDLY FEDERAL WORKPLACE

    Promoting Familv-Friendivlnitiatiyes. Under President Clinton's leadership, the federal
     government, striving to be a model employer for other private and public employers, has
     implemented family-friendly leave initiatives that enhance the ability of employees to balance
     family and employment obligations. In addition to leave initiatives, the federal government
     offers compressed or flexible work schedules to many workers so that they may spend more
     time with their families.

    Providing Child Care for Federal Workers. In addition to the Department of Defense's model
     child care program, there are more than 230 child care centers for civilian government
     employees in federal buildings in as many as 36 states. The General Services Administration
     (GSA) oversees 108 of these centers, making GSA the largest civilian sponsor of work-site
     child care in the nation. Under this Administration, the emphasis on quality has continued --
     with 73 percent of GSA sponsored centers accredited by the independent National Association
     for Education of Young Children, and with a goal of reaching 100 percent accreditation within
     two years. Striving to meet the needs of parent workers, 89 percent of GSA centers have infant
     care, 74 percent have drop-in/emergency care, and 42 percent provide summer programs for
     school aged children. In addition, more than 80 percent of centers are open 11 or more hours
     per day. Nearly 70 percent of the child care center directors have ten or more years of
     experience in early childhood education.

                     The White House Conference on Child Care
                                            Talking Points

   On Thursday, October 23, the President and First Lady will Host the White House
    Conference on Child Care in the East Room of the White House, bringing together parents,
    caregivers, business and labor leaders, child care experts and others.

   President Clinton has called child care "the next great frontier" of public policy. At the
    National Governors Association Annual Meeting, President Clinton said, "The First Lady and I
    have worked on [child care] -- she, particularly -- for a long time. We think every child should
    have access to quality child care, and we think it's the next great frontier if we're" going to make
    sure all Americans can succeed at home and at work."

   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton recently wrote, "If you're a working parent, chances are that
    you have to struggle to find affordable, quality child care. Like millions of others, you know just
    how important child care is to your family's well being and to your ability to work without worry.
    Yet for too long, parents across the country have struggled with too little information, too few
    choices and too much anxiety."

   Millions of Americans rely on child care and after-school programs to care for their
    children for part of each day. The conference will explore how the public and private sectors
    can respond to the need for safe, affordable, quality child care for American families who are
    struggling to be both good parents and good workers.

   The conference is intended to begin a dialogue on three critical child care issues --
    availability, affordability, and assuring safety and quality. And the conference is intended to
    highlight the roles that everyone -- including communities, business and labor leaders, child care'
    providers, Federal, state and local governments, and parents themselves -- can play in addressing
    these issues.

   The morning panel will discuss availability, affordability and assuring safety and quality in
    child care -- exploring why child care is important to our children's development and our nation's
    economy, and examining what child care looks like in America today. The afternoon panel will
    discuss how we mobilize all members of the community to support safe, affordable, quality
    child care for families who need it -- focusing on promising child care efforts across the country,
    both public and private.

   Interest is so great, the conference has expanded beyond the White House. Several Cabinet
    Secretaries will be hosting working sessions; sessions will be held at the Department of Health
    and Human Services hosted by Secretary Shalala, at USDA hosted jointly by Education Secretary
    Riley and Agriculture Secretary Glickman, and at the Department of Labor hosted by Secretary
    Herman.

   The conference proceedings will be watched across the country. More than 85 Satellite
    Conferences will be held across the nation, convening community leaders to watch the White
    House Conference and participate in discussions on child care.
