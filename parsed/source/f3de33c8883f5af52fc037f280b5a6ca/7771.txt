 Here is a tough one pager on farmers.  The vote will be on striking Ford,
so the heading is defending Ford, but I think we need to go after Lugar. ===========

     FORD APPROACH IS BEST FOR PUBLIC HEALTH, PROTECTS FARMERS,

      AND AVOIDS HANDING A WINDFALL PROFIT TO TOBACCO INDUSTRY



      Lugar Bill Would Require Drastic Cuts in Health Spending

        The Lugar bill requires the government to "buy-out" farmers from the quota program over
a three-year period (FY1999 through 2002). The cost of this buy-out over the three years is $18
billion dollars. If the Lugar farmer spending is added and state spending is kept the same,
the McCain Manager's Amendment spending on health research and public health
programs would have to be cut by 69 percent to make up the difference. (See chart
below). In contrast, the Ford-Hollings approach costs $2.1 billion a year during those years and
has no effect on the levels of spending in the McCain Amendment for NIH research, cessation,
prevention, education and enforcement efforts.


      Ford Limits Amount of Tobacco Grown; Lugar Dramatically Increases U.S.
       Production

        Senator Ford's bill (LEAF Act) maintains limits on the amount oftobacco that can be
grown in the United States. Under the competing Lugar approach, very large producers would
quickly expand their production. A U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis concludes
production of flue-cured tobacco is likely to increase by as much as 50% and burley tobacco is
projected to increase by as much as 20%. That is one reason why the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Cancer Society, and the American Lung Association support
continuation of the tobacco program.


      Ford-Hollings Protects Small and Minority Farms

        The increased production with lower profit margins under the Lugar approach will benefit
large corporate farmers, however, the legislation would have a disproportionately adverse impact
on minority and limited-resource tobacco producers. Market uncertainties and reduced margins
on small sales will destabilize many family farming operations. This will have a particularly
harsh effect on small African-American farms -- fully 90% of African-American farms have sales
ofless than $25,000.


      Lugar Leads to a Financial Windfall for Companies

        The creation of a free market in tobacco production will dramatically lower the prices the
companies will pay to buy tobacco. USDA estimates that under the Lugar bill, the price of
flue-cured tobacco would fall from $1.72 a pound to $1.15, and the price of burley would


                   o
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
plummet from $1.89 to $1.35. Given that the companies average almost 1.5 billion pounds of
purchases a year, . USDA estimates a financial windfall by the companies of at least $800
million annually or $20 billion over 25 years. The Ford approach is consistent with the overall
tobacco control legislation. It avoids generating windfall profits for the tobacco companies with
which the companies will offset the payments designed to force them to reduce youth smoking
rates.
