SUBJECT:      Options on Service Summit Follow-up

This memo summarizes some options designed to ensure that we continue to sound the themes of
the Presidents' Summit on America's Future in the coming weeks and months.

1. Working with America's Promise and Summit Leaders: We must determine how much
to emphasize events that reinforce our service message vs. work with the Summit's new 501c3,
"America's Promise." Although there are legal limits on our involvement, we are able to
continue to work with Gen. Powell, and it probably makes sense to do so since the Summit went
well and the President is so identified with it.

      We should emphasize the Summit's partnership approach and goals in our ongoing events
       as much as possible. Related events in May included the Welfare to Work Partnership
       event, and the Vice President's announcement of his new coalition of civic groups to
       mentor those leaving welfare.

      We should meet with staff at America's Promise to learn about their efforts to set targets
       for the five resources for children and track progress toward their goal of reaching two
       million children.

      We could ask America's Promise to report to us on its progress on a quarterly basis, if
       counsel approves. In that way, we could stay connected to America's Promise even as
       we keep its operations at an appropriate distance.

      Eli Segal has suggested bringing in CEO's to report on their progress since the Summit,
       or convening a conference on one or more of the five resources. The President has
       expressed interest in tying the summit's "safe places" goal to our juvenile justice
       initiative. We could also take advantage of Ray Chambers' interest in using schools to
       deliver services to kids to highlight our Communities in Schools proposal in the budget.

      Administration officials could participate in local summits around the country.

2. AmeriCorps and Other Service Opportunities: There are a variety of things we could do
to reinforce our announcement of 50,000 new AmeriCorps scholarships and our high school
service theme.

      The President could announce the first winners of the new High School Service Scholars
       program, perhaps in combination with the first Maryland high school class to graduate
       under their service requirement.


                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion




       We plan to write non-profit organizations to restate the President's Summit
        announcement of 50,000 new "scholarship only" AmeriCorps members. The
        Corporation has asked us to hold this for the time being because of their concern that they
        may get too much interest in this idea ..

       The President could announce the next group of scholarship-only AmeriCorps members.

       We could reach out to faith-based groups, perhaps involving Rev. Tony Campolo and his
        new "Mission Year" initiative. However, it is not clear whether Campolo's students can
        get AmeriCorps scholarships funding because of questions about their religious activities.
         We could work with other faith-based groups.

       One major goal we must stress in the coming weeks is getting AmeriCorps reauthorized.
        The Corporation wants to launch the Administration's reauthorization proposal at a
        roundtable on 'service with members of Congress in late June. Although reauthorization
        will be difficult, there will probably never be a better time to push for it and ensure some
        longevity for AmeriCorps beyond the President's term. Anything we can do to tie this to
        the Summit and even Powell would obviously be very helpful.

       Other options are to highlight the AmeriCorps component of America Reads,
        AmeriCorps' Teach for America program, various Corporation "service learning"
        programs, or the Corporation's senior service programs.
