                          Improvements to the Senate Juvenile Crime Legislation


             Three out of four "core mandates" preserved. Senator Hatch's bill originally
              weakened all of the core protections for juveniles in state custody. The bill that cleared
              the Senate today preserves language in current law ensuring that juveniles are separated
              by sight and sound from adults while incarcerated; that they are not placed in adult jails;
              and that status offenders are not incarcerated. However, the bill does re-write
              protections against disproportionate minority confinement. An Kennedy/Wellstone
              amendment to drop this provision was defeated, and this issue will have to be revisited in
              conference.

             Guaranteed prevention funds. The original Hatch bill provided almost no funds for
              prevention. The bill that passed today sets aside 25 percent of the $450 million Juvenile
              Accountability Block Grant for prevention, authorizes a separate $435 million for        .
              delinquency and prevention programs.

             No new death penalties. The original Hatch bill made 16-year olds eligible for the
              federal death penalty. This provision has been dropped.

             Onerous conditions on states deleted. To be eligible for the new block grant funds, the
              original Hatch bill required states to pass new laws to prosecute juveniles (14-year olds)
              as adults. These hard requirements have been dropped.

             Federalization clause dropped. The original Hatch bill included a presumption that all
              juvenile crime should be federal and then referred to states as appropriate. Chief Justice
              Rehnquist complained bitterly last year about this provision, and it is no longer in the bill.
