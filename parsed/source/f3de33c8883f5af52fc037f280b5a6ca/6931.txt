                         Questions And Answers on Pay Equity
                                    April 2, 1998


Q:   Wha~    is Equal Pay Day?

A:   April 3 is the day on which American women's wages, added to their previous year's
     earnings, equal what men make in just one calendar year. The President is issuing a
     proclarnation declaring April 3, 1998 as National Equal Pay Day.


Q:   What did the Vice President announce today?

A:   The Vice President announced the Administration's support for legislation introduced by
     Senator Daschle to improve the enforcement of wage discrimination laws and to
     strengthen the remedy provisions in the Equal Pay Act by permitting victims of wage
     discrimination to seek compensatory and punitive damages. Currently, women who are
     the victims of wage discrimination receive only backpay and liquidated damages, which
     may not fully compensate them for their loss. This change will mean that the penalties
     for sex-based wage discrimination will be the same as those for race-based wage
     discrimination.

     The Vice President also announced several administration initiatives aimed at enhancing
     enforcement of wage discrimination laws both in the private sector and within the federal
     government, including the development of a Memorandum of Understanding between the
     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor and a
     ten-step voluntary self-audit for both private businesses and the federal agencies to help
     them monitor their efforts on equal pay.
         "




Q:   Why is this legislation necessary?

A:   More than three decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil
     Rights Act, women and people of color continue to suffer the consequences of unfair pay
     differentials. The average women works a full year, plus three more months, just to earn
     the same pay that men eam in one calendar year. According to the Department of Labor,
     the average woman who works full-time earns just 74 cents for each dollar that men earn.
      For women of color, the gap is even wider. On average, black women earn only 63
     cents, and Hispanic women earn only 53 cents for each dollar earned by white men.
     Some wage differences exist due to differing levels of experience, education, and skill.
     However, studies show that even accounting for differences in education, experience, and
     occupation, there is still a significant wage differential.

                                                               Hex-Oump Conversion


Q:   What's wrong with the current scheme for collecting damages under the Equal Pay
     Act?

A:   Currently, the EPA allows only for liquidated damages and backpay awards. Liquidated
     damages usually are awarded in an amount equal to backpay. Such awards may not fully
     compensate a woman for real losses, such as damages for pain and suffering. In
     addition, women cannot receive punitive damages for wage discrimination, no matter
     how intentional and egregious the employer's conduct. The legislation the
     Administration is endorsing today will ensure that women are fully compensated when an
     employer discriminates against them in setting wages.


Q:   What is the Administration doing with respect to data collection?

A:   The endorsed legislation contains a Sense of the Senate that the President should take
     appropriate steps to increase the amount of information available with respect to wage
     disparities, while maximizing the utility of the data and protecting individuals' privacy
     and minimizing burdens on reporting entities. In addition, the Vice President announced
     an annual report on the pay gap, by sex, to be produced by the Department of Labor.
     This easy-to-access report will raise the national prominence of wage disparities and will
     highlight the issue every year in order to spur Americans to achieve increased gender pay
     equity.


Q:   Why is the federal government exempt from punitive and compensatory damages?

A:   The federal government is not liable for punitive damages in any of the
     anti-discrimination statutes. To maintain consistency in the application of these statutes,
     it was appropriate to exempt the federal government from punitive damages under the
     Equal Pay Act as well.


Q:   Is the Administration's policy on uncapped punitive and compensatory damages
     consistent with its position in other areas of the law such as tort reform?

A:   Yes, this is consistent with Administration's position on tort reform. Our proposals on
     tort reform have never sought to cap compensatory damages, which are necessary to
     remedy actual harm. And except in very exceptional circumstances, we have approved
     the use of punitive damage awards to deter intentional misconduct..

Questions ofthe Federal Work Force

Q:        What are some ofthe specific accomplishments of the Clinton Administration with
          respect to women appointees?

A:        Here are some specific accomplishments:

                     Appointed the first women ever to serve as Attorney General (Janet
                     Reno) and Secretary of State (Madeleine Albright). Including the
                     Attorney General and Secretary of State, women make up 27 percent
                     of the Clinton Cabinet:. The Cabinet also include: Alexis Herman,
                     Secretary of Labor; Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human
                     Services; Carol Browner, Administrator of the Environmental
                     Protection Agency; Janet Yellen, Chair of the Council of Economic
                     Advisors; and Charlene Barchevsky, United States Trade
                     Representative.
                     A third of all judicial nominees are women, the highest proportion
             ever.
                     Nominated the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court.
                     During his first year in office, President Clinton nominated Ruth
                     Bader Ginsberg to the United States Supreme Court.          Justice
                     Ginsburg is only the second woman to serve on the nation's highest
                     court.


     Q:      What is the representation of women in the federal work force?

     A:      Women represented 42.8 percent of the Federal permanent workforce in 1997
             compared to 46.4 percent of the Civilian Labor Force, a difference of a -3.6
             percentage points.


     Q:      How is the Federal government doing in terms of women's pay as compared
             to that of male Federal employees?

     A:      Because we classify jobs and then hire on merit, the incumbent is paid the same,
             male or female.


     Q:      A 1995 GAO Report contended that Federal occupations with high female
             representation were more likely to be under graded than other jobs. How
             did OPM ad(lress this issue?

     A:      At several points in the course of the study, OPM expressed its strong


                                                3

     disagreement with the scope and methodology used by the GAO contractor. An
     OPM letter, that is included as an appendix to the GAO Report, explains why
     OPM believes the GAO conclusions cannot be supported (factors such as
     misapplication of the Primary Standard in the Factor Evaluation System in the
     study, use of less rigorous methodology to evaluate a more job evaluation
     methodology, and disagreements between the study findings and other evidence).
     On the other hand, OPM continues to improve the Government's classification
     system and remains firmly committed to protecting the Merit System Principles
     and eliminating instances of economic discrimination against the dedicated
     women and minorities who serve our country.


Q:   How are women represented in the lower grade levels?

A:   Nearly 80 percent of women are employed in the GS-5 through 12.


Q:   How are women represented in the upper grade levels?

A:   The representation of women at the Senior Pay level of the Federal workforce is
     21 percent, compared to less than 10 percent a decade ago.


Q:   What is the "Senior Pay" level?

A:   The Senior Pay level includes employees in the Senior Executive Service (SES),
     Executive Schedule, Senior Foreign Service, and other employees earning salaries
     above grade 15 of the General Schedule (such as Administrative Law Judges).


Q:   What percentage of promotions went to women?

A:   Women received 51.8 percent of permanent workforce promotions in Fiscal Year
     1997.

Q:   In which occupation are women the worst represented?

A:   Women are worst represented in occupational series 0301, Miscellaneous
     Administration and Program Series. Compared to like occupations in the CLF,
     there is a shortfall of over 11,300 women in this occupation in the Federal
     Government.


Q:   What is the average salary of female political employees versus that of male
     appointees? How does that average compare to comparable figures in the
     previous Administration?

A:   In 1992, under President Bush, women made up 40 percent of the political ranks,
     and the average female political appointee's salary was 75 percent of the average
     male appointee's salary. In 1997, in the Clinton Administration, the percentage
     of women appointees increased to 45 percent, and the average woman's salary
     shot up to 85 percent of the average man's.
