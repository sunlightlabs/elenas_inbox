     TEXT:
     In preparation for the meeting on the Booz Executive Summary report on INS
     restructuring this afternoon, Julie and I put together the attached
     outline to help focus INS/Justice/Booz on what we believe should be
     addressed in their final report.  Any comments are welcome.  Thanks.

                              INS Restructuring Report Format

The report should layout the Administration's organizational plan (40K feet view) and explain
the need for a functional, programmatic split from headquarters to the field. The report should
elaborate on how this functional approach will address INS' programmatic and management
issues. It should discuss how this structure will improve performance and ways the agency will
measure improvement (consistency, lines-of-authority, accountability, customer service and
competence) and show progress. It should spell out an implementation "action" plan (two years)
that will allow stakeholder involvement as the restructuring is being developed and measurable
milestones to track the evolutionary progress of the restructuring.

The report must clearly show that the Administration: (1) knows what INS' operational and
management problems are; (2) has a clear, well defined organizational structure and rationale that
will address these problems effectively; (3) is willing to measure the effectiveness of this
organization as we move forward (understanding that this is a phased approach and modifications
may occur as it is implemented); and (4) has a clear understanding/path/action plan on how to
proceed.

                                  Organizational Design
                           Immigration and Naturalization Service

1.     Outline of Restructuring Principles

       -- One agency -- both functions.
       -- Structure that improves operations -- not moves boxes.
       -- Builds on the advances, accomplishments and improvements achieved over the past
            5 years.
       -- Maintain integration and synergy between enforcement and benefits.

2.     What is the Administration's plan?

       The Administration's approach is to recognize the need for INS to be organized along
       programmatic and function lines but to keep the INS intact. Separating enforcement and
       benefit/services operations -- both in headquarters and in the field -- will result in a more
       efficient and effective operation and strengthened accountability and lines of authority.
       Include Booz organizational charts/matrix that support this plan.

             INS remains intact with a Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner responsible
              for overall agency operations;
             Two Executive Associate Commissioners. One responsible for enforcement, the
             other for serviceslbenefits;
             Strengthen and clarify INS' operational field structure;
             Integration of all border enforcement entities;
             Separation of service-related functions from enforcement and development of an
              organizational structure for immigration benefits that is a "community based"
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


           approach that brings services to the immigrant client population (building off the
           naturalization redesign effort);
          Establish a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to improve INS financial, accounting
           and budget execution functions; and
          Clarify headquarter responsibilities and lines of authority.

3.   How will this functional split address long standing management and performance
     problems within the INS?

          Outline Booz findings and recommendations regarding weaknesses in the current
           structural make-up and why a functional restructuring can improve INS' ability to
           accomplish its tasks.
          Address areas of concern and explain how this organization will improve
           operations and effectively measure performance and chart improvement.
           -- Accountability                                  .
           -- Line-of Authority
           -- Consistency
           -- Customer Service
           -- Professionalism

4.   What is the recommended action or work plan to implement this restructuring,
     address operational and management weakness, and accomplish this
     transformation?

          Establish a March 31, 1998, to March 31, 2000, timeline to chart the INS
                   transformation. Include significant milestones (e.g. complete
           enforcement/service split, establish "model" local enforcement operation, etc.)
          Establish a temporary Office of Restructuring under the Commissioner
          The Department would solicit interest for an implementation contractor to further
           develop the INS restructuring, ensure coordination with and involvement of
           stakeholders, and gui~e the implementation process to completion (Coopers and
           Lybrand model).'
