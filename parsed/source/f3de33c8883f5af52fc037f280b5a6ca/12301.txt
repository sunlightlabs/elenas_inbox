  TITLE IV - SAFE AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES ACT

                 SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 401 of the bill would amend and restate Title IV of
the ESEA, which authorizes assistance to States, local
educational agencies, and other public entities and
nonprofit organizations for programs to create and maintain
drug-free, safe, and orderly schools, as described below.

                         SHORT TITLE

     Section 4001 - Short Title.  Section 4001 would rename
Title IV of the ESEA as the "Safe and Drug-Free Schools and
Communities Act" to update the short title of "Safe and
Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994" in the
current law.

                          FINDINGS

     Section 4002 - Findings. Section 4002 would update
the findings in section 4002 of the current law to focus
them on the need for program quality and accountability.

                           PURPOSE

       Section 4003 - Declaration of Purpose. Section 4003
 would contain a revised statement of purpose in section
 4003 of the current law to reflect the following
 overarching changes proposed in Title IV of the bill:   (1)
 a more focused program emphasis on supporting activities
 for creating and maintaining drug-free, safe, and orderly
 environments for learning in and around schools, as
 compared to the more general emphasis under the current
 program on supporting activities to prevent youth from
 using drugs and engaging in violent behavior any time,
 anywhere; (2) improved targeting of resources, through the
 requirement that State educational agencies (SEAs) award
 funds competitively to local educational agencies (LEAs)
 with a demonstrated need for funds and the highest quality
 proposed programming, as compared to awarding funds to all
 LEAs in the State noncompetitively, based on student
 enrollment, under the current law; and (3) stronger
 coordination between programs funded by the Governors and
·the SEAs, by requiring that programs funded by the
 Governors directly complement and support LEA programs, and
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


by requiring Governors and SEAs to reserve funds at the
State level for joint capacity-building and technical
assistance, and accountability services, to improve the
effectiveness of, and institutionalize, State and local
Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities (SDFSC)
programs.

               AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS

     Section 4004 - Authorization. Section 4004 of the
bill would extend "such sums" authorizations for SDFSC
State grants and SDFSC National Programs for fiscal years
2001 through 2005, and establish a new such sums
authorization in each of these years for "Project SERVO
under Part C of Title IV.

   PART A - STATE GRANTS FOR DRUG AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION
                          PROGRAMS

                 RESERVATIONS AND ALLOTMENTS

     Section 4111(a) - Reservations.   Section 4111 (a) (1)
of the bill would retain the requirements in the current
law for the Secretary to reserve, from each fiscal year's
appropriation for SDFSC State grant funds, 1.percent for
the Outlying Areas, 1 percent for programs for Indian
youth, and 0.2 percent for programs for Native Hawaiians,
and would increase the amount of SDFSC State Grant funds
the Secretary may reserve each fiscal year for evaluation
to $2 million (up from $1 million under the current law) to
support more intensive evaluations that are needed to
demonstrate program outcomes and effectiveness.

      Section 4111 (a) (2) (A) (i) would prohibit the Insular
Areas from consolidating their SDFSC funds with other
Department of Education program funds, as would otherwise
be permitted under Insular Areas Consolidated Grant
Authority in Title V of Public Law 95-134.       This language
would ensure that the SEA and Governor of each Insular Area
can coordinate their SDFSC programs as required elsewhere
in this Part in sections 4113 (b) (4) and 4115 (b) (3) i without
this prohibition, a Governor or SEA may choose to spend its
SDFSC funds on other eligible program(s), making it
impossible for the Governor and SEA to meet these SDFSC
program coordination requirements.




                               2
                                                          Hex·Dump Conversion
      Section 4111 (a) (2) (A) (ii) would allow the Governor of
an Insular Area to consolidate its SDFSC funds with the
Insular Area's SDFSC SEA funds, and allow the Insular Area
to administer both SDFSC funding streams under the
statutory requirements applicable to SDFSC SEA programs.
This provision would address the reduced program
flexibility and increased administrative burden the Insular
Areas may experience from the prohibition in section
4111 (a) (2) (i) .

     Section 4111 (a) (2) (A) (iii) would add cross-references
to other provisions in the legislation to explicitly make
applicable to the Insular Areas the same SDFSC requirements
concerning authorized programs and activities, applications
for funding, and coordination between the Governor and the
SEA that are applicable to the States.

     Section 4111(a) (2) (B) would add cross reference to
other provisions in the legislation to explicitly make
applicable to the Secretary of the Interior the same SDFSC
requirements concerning authorized programs and activities
for SDFSC programs for Indian youth that are applicable to
the States.

     Section 4111(a) (2) (C) would authorize SDFSC programs
for Native Hawaiians (which are currently authorized under
section 4118) and explicitly make applicable to these
programs the same SDFSC requirements concerning authorized
programs and activities that are applicable to the States.
This section would also delete the language in current
section 4118 requiring the Governor of the State of Hawaii
to recognize organizations eligible for funding under the
SDFSC Native Hawaiian set-side, and add language requiring
that programs funded under this set-aside be coordinated
with the Hawaii SEA.

      Section 4111(b) (1) - State Allotments.  Section
4111 (b) (1) would retain the provisions in the current law
requiring the Secretary to allocate State grant funds half
on the basis of school-aged population, and half on the
basis of State shares of ESEA Title I funding for the
preceding year.

     Section 4111 (b) (2) - Minimum. Section 4111 (b) (2)
would retain the provision in the current law that no State
receive less than one-half of one percent of all State
grant funding.



                               3
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

     Section 4111 (b) (3) - Reallotment. Section 4111 (b) (3)
would retain the provisions in the current law permitting
the Secretary to redistribute to other States, on the basis
of the formula in section 4111(b) (1), any amount of State
grant funds the Secretary determines a State will be unable
to use within two year of the initial award.

     Section 4111(b) (4) - Definitions. Section 4111 (b) (4)
would retain the definitions of "State" and "local
educational agency" in the current law.

                      STATE APPLICATIONS

      Section 4112(a) - State Applications.   Section
4112 (a) (1) would change the State grant application
requirements in the current law to require that the
Governor and SEA apply jointly for funds, to ensure
increased coordination between the Governor and SEA,
consistent with the new program requirements proposed in
section 4113 (b) (4) and 4115 (b) (3) .

     Section 4112 (a) (2) would retain, with minor technical
changes, the requirement in the current law that States
include in their SDFSC State grant application a
description of how they will coordinate their SDFSC State
grant funding with other Federal education and drug
prevention programs.

      Section 4112 (a) (3) (A) and (B) would change the current
statute to require the States to include in their SDFSC
State grant applications:        (1) a list of the State's
program performance indicators for drug and violence
prevention that are (a) outcomes-based, rather than simply
"measurable" as under current law, and (b) selected from a
core set of indicators to be developed by the Secretary in
consultation with State and local officials; and (2) a
description of (a) the procedures the State will use to
inform its LEAs of the State's performance indicators under
this program and for assessing and publicly reporting
progress toward meeting those indicators (or revising them
as needed), and (b) how the procedures the State will use
(as described in the State's application under sections
4112 (a) (3) (C), 4112 (a) (3) (D), and section 4112 (a) (3) (E)
below) to select LEAs and other entities for SDFSC State
grant funding will support the attainment of the State's
results-based performance indicators. These changes would

                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
address the problem that, under current law, many States
have weak goals and objectives for their SDFSC programs
that are entirely process-oriented and do not tie
strategically to the State's needs in this area.

     Section 4112 (a) (3) (C) would change the current statute
to require the States to include in their SDFSC State grant
applications a description of the procedures the SEA will
use for reviewing applications and awarding funds to LEAs
competitively, based on need and quality as required by
section 4113 (c) (2) .  These changes constitute a
significant departure from current law, under which SEAs
award funds to LEAs on the basis of student enrollment and
on State-determined "greatest need" criteria.

     Section 4112 (a) (3) (D) would modify the current statute
to require the States to include in their SDFSC State grant
applications a description of the procedures the SEA will
use for reviewing applications and awarding funds to LEAs
non-competitively, based on need and quality as permitted
by section 4113 (c) (3) .

     Section 4112 (a) (3) (E) would change the current statute
to require the Governors to include in their SDFSC State
grant applications a description of the procedures the
Governor will use for reviewing applications and awarding
funds to eligible applicants competitively, based on need
and quality, as required by section 4115(c).      These
changes would significantly strengthen the current law,
which does specify any criteria for how Governors must
award their funds under this program.

     Section 4112 (a) (3) (F) would add a requirement for
States to include in their applications a description of
how the SEA and Governor will use the funds reserved under
sections 4113(b) and 4115(b) for coordinated capacity-
building and technical assistance and program
accountability services and activities at the State and
local levels, consistent with the changes in those sections
requiring that the SEA and Governor each contribute at
least 10 percent of their respective funds to a joint
capacity-building and technical assistance and program
accountability effort. Section 4112 (a) (3) (F) would also
retain language in the current law, with minor
modifications, requiring the SEA and Governor to describe
in their applications how they will coordinate their
activities with law enforcement, health, mental health, and



                                   5
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

education programs and officials at the State and local
levels.

     Section 4112 (a) (3) (G) would, with minor technical
changes, reta~n the requirement in the current statute for
States to include in their applications a description of
how the SEA and Governor will monitor local SDFSC programs.

     Section 4112 (a) (3) (H) would add a new requirement for
States to describe in their applications how the SEA will
provide technical assistance to LEAs not receiving SDFSC
State grant funds to improve their programs, consistent
with the requirement in section 4113 (b) (4) (B) (ii) that, to
the extent practicable, SEAs and Governors use a portion of
the funds they reserve for State-level activities to
provide capacity building and technical assistance and
accountability services to all LEAs in the State, including
those that do not receive SDFSC State grant funds.

     Section 4112 (a) (4) would retain the requirement that
the States develop their applications in consultation and
coordination with appropriate State officials and
representatives of parents, students, and community-based
organizations, with minor changes deleting language in the
current law that the SEA and Governor develop portions of
the application separately, to conform with the
requirements in sections 4113 (b) (4) and 4115 (b) (3) that the
SEA and Governor use a portion of the funds they reserve
for State-level activities to provide capacity building and
technical assistance and accountability services on a joint
basis.

     Section 4112(a) (5) would retain the language in
current law requiring the States to include in their
applications an assurance that the State will cooperate
with, and assist the Secretary in conducing national impact
evaluations of programs required by section 4117(a).

     Section 4112(b) would retain the language in the
current law under section 4112(d) requiring the Secretary
to use a peer review process in reviewing SDFSC State
grant applications.

         STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY PROGRAMS

     Section 4113(a) - Allocation of Funds.  Section
4113(a) would retain the requirement in current law that



                               6
                                                     Hex-Dump ConversIon
80 percent of the funds allocated to each State under
section 4111(b) be awarded to the SEA for use by SEAs and
LEAs, with minor changes in language conforming with the
revised statement of purpose in section 4003 that the funds
be used to carry out programs and activities that are
designed to create and maintain drug-free, safe, and
orderly learning environments for learning in and around
schools.

     Section 4113(b) - State-Level Activities.    Sections
4113(b) (1) through 4113(b) (3) would depart from the current
statute by establishing a new authority requiring SEAs to
reserve between 10 percent and 20 percent of their
allocations under section 4113(a) for State-level
activities. Under this new authority, SEAs may reserve up
to 20 percent, but not less than 10 percent, of their total
allocations under section 4113(a) to plan, develop, and
implement, jointly with the Governor, capacity building and
technical assistance and accountability services to support
the effective implementa~ion of local drug and violence
prevention activities throughout the State and promote
program accountability and improvement.    Within this
20 percent cap, but in addition to the 10 minimum for
State-level activities, SEAs may also use up to 5 percent
of their funding (i.e., up to 25 percent of the amount they
reserve for State-level activities) for program
administration. This allowance for SEA State
administrative costs - an increase from the 4 percent
allowed under current law - is provided to accommodate the
increased administrative responsibilities under the new law
of running a State grant competition under section 4113(c),
and would provide greater assistance to LEAs for program
improvement than under the current law.

     Section 4113(b) (4) (A) would require SEAs and Governors
to jointly use the amount reserved under section 4113 (b) (3)
and section 4114 (b) (3) to plan, develop, and implement
capacity building and technical assistance and
accountability services designed to support the effective
implementation of local drug and violence prevention
activities throughout the State, as well as promote program
accountability and prevention.

      Section 4113 (b) (4) (B) (i) would add new language to the
statute clarifying that the SEA and Governor may carry out
the services and activities required under section
4113 (b) (4) (A) directly, or through subgrants or contracts



                                7

with public and private organizations, as well as
individuals_

     Section 4113 (b) (4) (B) (ii) would add new language to
the statue requiring that to the extent practicable, SEAs
and Governors use funds under section 4113 (b) (4) (A) to
provide capacity building and technical assistance and
accountability services and activities to all LEAs in the
State, not just those that receive SDFse State grants, in
order to ensure that:      (1) LEAs receiving SDFse funds
receive adequate help to implement and institutionalize
high-quality programs; and (2) States can provide at least
some program assistance to LEAs that will no longer receive
SDFse awards once funding limited to 50 percent of LEAs in
each State under the targeting provisions proposed in
section 4113 (c) (2) (D) _

     Section 4113(b) (4) (B) (iii) would permit the SEA and
Governor to provide emergency intervention services to
schools and communities following a traumatic crisis, such
as a shooting or major accident that has disrupted the
learning environment.

     Section 4113 (b) (4) (e) would add definitions of
"capacity building" and "technical assistance and
accountability services" to clarify the meaning of these
terms in the statute_

     Section 4113 (c) (1) - Local-Level Activities. Section
4113(c) (1) would depart from the current statute to specify
that SEAs must use at least 80 percent of their funding for
local-level activities, as described in sections 4113 (c) (2)
and (3), rather than awarding at least 91 percent of their
funding to LEAs as is required ~nder current law.

     Section 4113 (c) (2) (A) would depart from the current
statute to require SEAs to use at least 70 percent of their
total SDFse State grant funding for competitive awards to
LEAs that the SEA determines have need for assistance,
rather than awarding at least 91 percent of their funding
to LEAs in the State by formula, based on enrollment
(70 percerit) and "greatest need" (30 percent) .

     Section 4113 (c) (2) (B) would make minor wording changes
to the nine "need" factors in the current statute, and add
three additional factors relating to local fiscal capacity
to fund drug and violence prevention programs without



                               8
                                                         Hex.Dump Conversion
Federal assistance; the incidence of drug paraphernalia in
schools; and the high rates of drug-related emergencies or
deaths.

      Section 4113 (c) (2) (C) would depart from the current
statute to require SEAs to base their competition under
section 4113 (c) (2) (A) on the quality of an LEA's proposed
program and how closely it is aligned with the following
principles of effectiveness:      (1) the LEA's program is
based on a thorough assessment of objective data about the
drug and violence problems in the schools and communities
to be served; (2) the LEA has established a set of
measurable goals and objectives aimed at ensuring that all
schools served by the LEA have a drug-free, safe, and
orderly learning environment, and has designed its program
to meet those goals and objectives; (3) the LEA has
designed and will implement its programs for youth based on
research or evaluation that provides evidence that the
program to be used will prevent or reduce drug use,
violence, delinquency, or disruptive behavior among youth;
and (4) the LEA will evaluate its program periodically to
assess its progress toward achieving its goals and
objectives, and will use evaluation results to refine,
improve, and strengthen its program, and refine its goals
and objectives, as needed.

     Section 4113(c) (2) (D) would depart from the current
statute to require SEAs to target their competitive awards
under section 4113 (c) (2) (A) to no more than 50 percent of
the LEAs in the State.

      Section 4113 (c) (2) (E) would require SEAs to make their
competitive awards to LEAs under section 4113 (c) (2) of
sufficient size to support high-quality, effective programs
and activities that are designed to create safe,
disciplined, and drug-free learning environments in schools
and that are consistent with the needs, goals, and
objectives identified in the State's plan under section
4112.

      Section 4113 (c) (3) (A) would depart from the statute to
permit SEAs to use up to 10 percent of their total SDFSC
State grant funding for non-competitive awards to LEAs with
the greatest need for assistance, as described in section
4113 (c) (2) (B), that did not receive a competitive award
under section 4113 (c) (2) (A).   LEA's would be eligible to
receive only one subgrant under this paragraph.

      Section 4113(c) (3) (B) would require, for
accountability purposes, that in order for an SEA to make a
non-competitive award to an LEA under section
4113 (c) (3) (A)
             I   the SEA must (1) assist the LEA in meeting
the information requirements under section 4116(a)
pertaining to LEA needs assessment, results-based
performance measures, comprehensive safe and drug-free
schools plan, evaluation plan, and assurances, and
(2) provide continuing technical assistance to the LEA to
build its capacity to develop and implement high-quality,
effective programs consistent with the principles of
effectiveness in section 4113 (c) (2) (C) (ii) .

     Section 4113 (c) (4) (A) would depart from the current
statute to permit SEAs to use up to 2 percent of their
total SDFSC State grant funding or $50,000, whichever is
greater, to provide emergency intervention services to
schools and communities following a traumatic crisis, such
as a shooting or major accident that has disrupted the
learning environment, and explicitly authorize that such
services may be provided directly by the SEA or through
subgrants or contracts.

      Section 4113(c) (4) (B) would specify that the emergency
services and activities authorized under Section 4113(c) (4)
include (1) helping school personnel assess the situation,
including the resources available to address the crisis;
(2) developing a response plan to coordinate services from
the Federal, State, and local levels; (3) providing short-

students, teachers, and others in need of such services;
 (4) increasing school security; and    (5) providing such
other services, including coordination services, as
necessary.

     Section 4113(d) - Project Periods and Reallocations.
Section 4113(d) (1) would depart from the current statute to
provide that LEA awards under section 4113(c) be for a
project period not to exceed three years, and require that,
in order to receive funds under section 4113 for the second
or third year of a pr0ject, the LEA demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the SEA that the LEA's project is making
reasonable progress toward its performance indicators under
section 4116 (a) (3) (c) .

                                                          Hex.Dump Conversion
     Section 4113(d) (2) would make technical changes to the
local reallocation provisions in the current statute
consistent with the changes proposed in section 4113, by
providing that an SEA may require LEAs to return funds
awarded to them under this section that they have not
expended within one year of the date of the subgrant, and
may award such recovered funds to other LEAs with the
greatest need for them either (1) through a new
competition, (2) by funding high-quality applications that
were not funded in a previous competition, or (3) by making
supplemental awards to current subgrant recipients.

           LOCAL DRUG AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS

      Section 4114(a) - Principles of Effectiveness.
Section 4114(a) would depart from the current statute to
require that each LEA that receives SDFSC State grant
funding under section 4113(c) use those funds to support
research-based, drug and violence prevention services and
activities that are consistent with the principles of
effectiveness in section 4113 (c) (2) (C) (ii) .

      Section 4114(b) - Other Authorized Activities.
Section 4114(b) (1) would permit an LEA that receives SDFSC
State grant funding under section 4113(c) to use those
funds for activities other than research-based programming,
so long as the LEA meets the requirements in section
4114(a), and those additional activities are carried out in
a manner that is consistent with the most recent relevant
research and with the purposes of this title.    Section
4114 (b) (1) of the bill also includes an illustrative list
of 12 such activities.

     Section 4114(b) (2) would retain the 20 percent cap on
SDFSC State grant funds that LEAs may spend for the
acquisition or use of metal detectors and security
personnel, but permit SEAs to waive this cap for an LEA
that demonstrates to the satisfaction of its SEA, in its
application for funding under section 4116, that it has a
compelling need to do so.

                  GOVERNOR'S PROGRAMS

     Section 4115(a) - Allocation of Funds.  Section
4115(a) would retain the requirement in the current law
that 20 percent of the funds allocated to each State under
section 4111(b) be awarded to the Governor, but depart from



                             11
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
the current statute, consistent with the revised statement
of purpose in section 4003, by requiring the Governor to
use these funds to support community efforts that directly
complement the efforts of LEAs to foster drug-free, safe,
and orderly learning environments for learning in and
around schools.

      Section 4115(b) - State-Level Activities. Sections
4115(b) (1) through 4115(b) (3) would depart from the current
statute by establishing a new authority requiring Governors
to reserve between 10 percent and 20 percent of their
allocations under section 4115(a) for State-level
activities. Under this new authority, Governors may
reserve up to 20 percent, but not less than 10 percent, of
their total allocations under section 4115(a) to plan,
develop, and implement, jointly with the SEA, capacity
building and technical assistance and accountability
services to support the effective implementation of local
drug and violence prevention activities throughout the
State and promote program accountability and improvement,
as described in section 4113(b) (4).   Within this 20 percent
cap, but in addition to the 10 minimum for State-level
activities, the bill would retain the language in the
current law authorizing the Governors to use up to
5 percent of their total funding (i.e., up to 25 percent of
the amount they reserve for State-level activities) for
program administration, with minor changes clarifying that
these administrative costs may be direct or indirect.

     Section 4115(c) - Local Level Activities.    Section
4115(c) (1) (A) would dep~rt from the current statute to
specify that a Governor must use at least 80 percent of its
SDFSC State grant funding under section 4111(b) to make
competitive subgrants to community-based organizations,
LEAs, and other public entities and private non-profit
organizations to support community efforts that directly
complement the efforts of LEAs to foster drug-free, safe,
and orderly learning environments in and around schools.
Section 4115(c) (1) (B) would depart from the current statute
to require that, to be eligible. for a subgrant under this
section, an applicant (other than a LEA applying on its own
behalf) must include in its application its written
agreement with one or more LEAs, or one or more schools
within a LEA, to provide services and activities in support
of such LEAs or schools, as well as an explanation of how
those services and activities will complement or support
the LEAs' or schools' efforts to provide a drug-free, safe,



                              12
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
and orderly school environment. Section 4115(c) (1) (C) would
depart from current law to require Governors to base the
competition conducted under section 4115 (c) (1) (A) on (1)
the quality of the applicant's proposed program and how
closely it is aligned with the principles of effectiveness
described in section 4113 (c) (2) (C) (ii), and (2) on
objective criteria, determined by the Governor, on the
needs of the schools or LEAs to be served.

     Section 4115 (c) (1) (0) would change current law to
clarify that subgrants made by Governors under
section 4115(c) may support community efforts on a
Statewide, regional, or local basis and may support the
efforts of LEAs and schools that do not receive SOFSC State
grant funds.

      Section 4115 (c) (2) (A) would change the statute to
require that recipients under section 4115(c) to use those
funds generally to support research-based, drug and
violence prevention services and activities that are
consistent with the principles of effectiveness in section
4113 (c) (2) (C) (ii) .

      Section 4115 (c) (2) (E) would change the statute to
permit a Governor's award recipient under section 4115(c)
to use those funds for activities other than research-based
programming, provided that these additional activities are
carried out in a manner that is consistent with the most
recent relevant research and with the purposes of this
title.   Section 4115 (c) (2) (E) also includes an illustrative
list of 5 such activities.

                      LOCAL APPLICATIONS

     Section 4116 - Application Contents.   Section
4116(a) (1) would:  (1) retain language in current statute,
with minor technical changes, requiring applicants for
subgrants from the SEA to submit an application that meets
the requirements in section 4116(a) (3) to the SEA at such
time, and includes such other information, as the SEA may
require; and (2) add a corresponding requirement not in the
current statute, requiring applicants for subgrants from
the Governor to submit an application that meets the
requirements in section 4116(a) (3) to the Governor at such

develop their applications in consultation with a local or
regional advisory council that includes, to the extent
possible, representatives of local government, business,
parents, students, teachers, public school personnel,
mental health service providers, appropriate State
agencies, private schools, law enforcement, community-based
organizations, and other groups interested in, and
knowledgeable about, drug and violence prevention.

     Section 4116 (a) (2) (B) would add language to the
current law to require entities other than LEAs applying

section 4115(c) to develop their applications in
consultation with the schools or LEAs to be served, and to
the extent practicable, with the representatives described

      Section 4116(a) (3) would:  (1) make technical changes
to strengthen the LEA application requirements that apply,
under current law, to the SEA formula grant program by
increasing the emphasis in the application on the
applicant's need for assistance and the quality of its
proposed programming; and (2) make this revised set of
requirements applicable to LEAs that apply to SEAs under
the proposed new competitive subgrant authority in section
4113 (c) (2) or the new non-competitive subgrant authority in
section 4113(c) (3), as well as to LEAs that apply to
Governors under the subgrant authority in section 4115(c)

     Section 4116(a) (4) would depart from the current
statute by adding the requirement that each LEA (or
consortium of LEAs, if applying jointly) that applies to

that applies to the Governor for a subgrant under section
4115(c) include in its application:    (1) a description of
how the services and activities to be supported will be

     Section 4116(b) would modify the language in the
current statute that requires Governors to use a peer
review process in reviewing local applications for SDFSC
State grants, by giving Governors the flexibility to use
other methods to ensure that applications under section
4116 are funded on the basis of need and quality, while
requiring State educational agencies to use a peer review
process.

          NATIONAL EVALUATIONS AND DATA COLLECTIONS

or a school-sponsored function, within 30 days of incident.
This requirement will enable the Federal Government to
collect longitudinal data on this statistic less
expensively than it does currently by collecting these data
retrospectively from multiple sources, and will impose
little administrative burden on the States.

      Section 4117(c) - Local Reports.   Section
4117(c) (1) (A) would make minor technical changes to the
current law to refocus the local reports required by this

by the SEA, to assist the SEA in planning its technical
assistance activities.    These changes would apply to LEAs
that receive SDFSC subgrants through their SEA under
section 4113 (c) (2) or 4113 (c) (3) .

     Section 4117 (c) (1) (E) would add new language to the

section 4115(c) submit an annual progress report to the
Governor and to the public containing the same type of
information required for LEA progress reports under section
4117 (c) (1) (A) .

     Section 4117(c) (2) (E) would add new language to the

Secretary (who shall serve as chair of the Committee), the
Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, the Director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, and such other members as the Secretary shall
determine.

     Section 4311 (c) (2) would add new language to the
statute charging the Federal Coordinating Committee on
school crises established under section 4311(c) (1) with
coordinating the Federal responses to crises that occur in
schools or directly affect the learning environment in
schools.

                    PART D - RELATED PROGRAMS

                       GUN-FREE SCHOOLS ACT

     Section 4411 - Short Title. Section 4411 would rename
section 4411 of the ESEA as the Gun-Free Schools Act.  The
Gun-Free Schools Act is currently authorized under Part F
of Title XIV of the ESEA, and is proposed to be moved to
Title IV because of its close relationship with the SDFSC
program.

     Section 4411 (b) - Requirements.  Section 4411 (b) (1)
would restate, with minor technical changes, the language
in the current Gun-Free Schools Act requiring (1) that each
State receiving Federal funds under the ESEA have in effect
a State law requiring LEAs to expel from school, for a
period of not less than one year, a student who is
determined to have possessed a firearm at school under the
jurisdiction of the LEA in that State, and (2) that such
State law allows the chief administering officer of that
LEA to modify the expulsion requirement for a student on a
case-by-case basis.

     Section 4411 (b) (2) would restate the definition of the
term "firearm" as used in the current Gun-Free Scho6ls Act.

                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

     Section 4411(c) - Special Rule.  Section 4411(c) would
restate the language in the current Gun-Free Schools Act
requiring that the provisions of section 4411 be construed
in a manner consistent with the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act.

     Section 4411(d) - Report to State. Section 4411(d)
would restate, with minor changes, the local reporting
requirements in the current Gun-Free Schools Act to require
each LEA requesting assistance from the SEA under the ESEA
to provide to the State in its application:   (1) an
assurance that such LEA is in compliance with the State law
required by section 4411(b); and (2) a description of the
circumstances surrounding any expulsions imposed under the
State law required by section 4411(b), including (a) the
name of the school concerned; (b) the number of students
expelled from such school (disaggregated by gender, race,
ethnicity, and educational level), and (c) type of weapons
concerned.

     Section 4411(e) - Reporting.  Section 4411(e) would
restate the requirement in the current Gun-Free Schools Act
that each State report the information described in section
4411(d) to the Secretary on an annual basis.

                         LOCAL POLICIES

     Section 4412(a) - Required Policies.   Section
4412(a) (1) would restate, with minor technical changes, the
language in the current law (in ESEA section 14602(a))
requiring that no funds be made available under the ESEA to
any LEA unless it has a policy requiring referral to the
criminal justice or juvenile delinquency system of any
student who possesses a firearm at a school served by such
agency.

      Section 4412(a) (2) would add an additional, new
requirement under section 4412 that no funds may be made
available under the ESEA to any LEA unless it also has a
policy requiring that any student referred to the criminal
justice or juvenile delinquency system under section
4412 (a) (1) for possessing a firearm at school, also be
referred to a mental health professional for assessment as
to whether the student poses an imminent threat of harm to
himself or others and needs appropriate mental health
services before readmission to school.

                                                    Hex-Oump Conversion


     Section 4412 (a) (3) would add an additional, new
requirement under section 4412 that any student who is
expelled for possession of a firearm at school be provided
services to the extent necessary to enable the student to
progress appropriately in the general curriculum.

     Section 4412(b) - Special Rule.   Section 4412(b)
would restate the language in the durrent Gun-Free Schools
Act requiring that the provisions of section 4412 be
construed in a manner consistent with the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act.

     Section 4412(b) - Definitions.  Section 4412(b) would
restate the definitions of the terms "firearm" and "school"
in the current ESEA (in section 14602(b)) so that these
definitions apply to the changes proposed in section 4412.

                         MATERIALS

     Section 4413(a) - "Wrong and Harmful Message".
Section 4413(a) would restate the language in the current
law (in ESEA section 4132(a)) requiring that drug
prevention programs supported under ESEA Title IV convey a
clear and consistent message that the illegal use of
alcohol and other drugs is wrong and harmful.

     Section 4413(b) - Curriculum.  Section 4413(b) would
restate, with minor technical changes, the language in the
current law (in ESEA section 4132(b)) to clarify that the
Secretary shall not prescribe the use of particular
curricula for programs under ESEA Title IV, but may
evaluate and disseminate information about the
effectiveness of such curricula and programs.

                     PROHIBITED USES OF FUNDS

     Section 4414 - Prohibited Uses.  Section 4414 would
restate the language in the current law (in ESEA section
4133) that no funds under ESEA Title IV may be used for (1)
construction (except for minor remodeling needed to
accomplish the purposes of this part), and (2) medical
services, drug treatment or rehabilitation, except for
pupil services or referral to treatment for students who
are victims of, or witnesses to, crime or who use alcohol,
tobacco, or drugs.

                    TOBACCO-FREE SCHOOLS

     Section 4415(a) - Required Policy. Section 4415(a)
would add new language to the ESEA requiring that each SEA
and LEA that receives ESEA funds have a policy that
prohibits the use of tobacco, in any form, at any time, and
by any person, in school buildings, on school grounds, or
at any school-sponsored event. This language would replace
similar language under current law in the Pro-Children Act
of 1994 (Title X, Part B of the Goals 2000: Educate America
Act) that (1) generally prohibits smoking in schools or
other indoor facilities where services are provided to
children that are supported with Federal funds from the
Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, or
Agriculture, and (2) authorizes civil penalties for persons
who violate such prohibition. The proposed new language
would also impose more stringent requirements than the Pro-
Children Act, in that:   (1) the Pro-Children Act pertains
only to smoking, whereas the proposed new language would
prohibit smoking as well as the use of smokeless tobacco in
schools; and (2) the Pro-Children Act prohibitions on
smoking pertain to indoor facilities only and apply only
during the school day, whereas the proposed new language
would prohibit the use of tobacco on school grounds as well
as in school buildings, at any time, or at any school-
sponsored event.  In accordance with this new language in
section 4415, section 402 of this bill would amend the Pro-
Children Act so it does not apply to schools or other
facilities providing services to children funded by the
Department of Education.

     Section 4415(b) - Assurance.  Section 4415(b) would
add language to the current law requiring each LEA
requesting assistance under the ESEA to include in its
application for funding an assurance that it is in
compliance with the requirements of section 4415(a) .

     Section 4415(c) - State Reporting.  Section 4415(c)
would add language to the current law requiring each SEA to
report to the Secretary on an annual basis if any of its
LEAs is not in compliance with the requirements of
section 4415(a).

     Section 4415(d) - Short Title.  Section 4415(d) would
add language to the current law providing that section 4415
may be cited as the "Tobacco-Free Schools Act."

                                                      Hex.Dump Conversion

                 PROHIBITION OF SUPPLANTING

     Section 4416 - Supplanting Prohibited.  Section 4416
would add language to the current law that was
inadvertently left out of the 1994 reauthorization,
requiring that funds under this title be used to increase
the level of State, local, and other non-Federal funds that
would, in the absence of funds under this title, be made
available for programs and activities authorized under this
title, and in no case to supplant such State, local, and
other non-Federal funds.

                    DEFINITION OF TERMS

     Section 4417 - Definitions. Section 4417 would
restate the definitions in the current law for the terms
"drug and violence prevention" and "hate crime," and
definitions for the terms "drug treatment and drug
rehabilitation" and "medical services" to give these terms
specific meaning under this title.

                ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

     Section 402 of the bill would amend the Pro-Children
Act (Part H of Title X of the Goals 2000: Educate America
Act) so it does not apply to schools or other facilities
providing services to children funded by the Department of
Education, because the education provisions of the Pro-
Children Act would be superceded by the Tobacco-Free
Schools Act proposed under ESEA section 4415.
