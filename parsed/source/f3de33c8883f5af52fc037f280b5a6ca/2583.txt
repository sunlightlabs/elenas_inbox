                         Administration's Juvenile Crime Legislation

Issue: Prevention Funding. The CBC may criticize the Administration's Anti-Gang and Youth
Violence Act as lacking in substantial prevention funding.

      Unlike the House-passed bill which has no earmarked prevention funding, we have
       targeted prevention funding in our legislation. Our bill contains $75 million for a new
       At-Risk Children's Initiative. The funding can be used for anti-truancy, curfews
       programs, and other prevention and intervention initiatives.

      Our juvenile crime strategy also provides over $60 million for afterschool programs (FY
       1998 budget request) .to keep schools open late, on the weekends and in the summer.

Issue: Incarceration of juveniles with adults in the federal system. The CBC is likely to
criticize the Administration's bill for weakening the strictures on allowing juveniles to be housed
with adults. Our legislation allows juveniles prosecuted as adults to be housed with adults
after they reach the age of 16, at the discretion of the Bureau of Prisons.

      Under the Administration's bill, juveniles prosecuted as juveniles could not be housed
       with adults until they reach age 18, regardless of the offense. No juvenile under age 16
       who has been charged or convicted as an adult could be housed with an adult.

      As juveniles have become increasingly violent, housing dangerous juveniles with other
       juveniles can endanger younger, and sometimes more vulnerable, delinquents. It is
       appropriate to give federal prison authorities the ability to be flexible depending upon the
       attributes of the individual defendant.

Issue: Prosecution of more juveniles as adults. The Administration's bill expands the
circumstances in which federal prosecutors can transfer juveniles to adult criminal court.

      In most cases, juveniles charged as adults may petition the court to be tried as juveniles.
       The proposed change contained in our bill is designed to ensure that these decisions are
       made fairly and expeditiously, and that they appropriately reflect the dangers that some
       juveniles pose to their communities.

Issue: More mandatory minimum sentences for juveniles. The Administration's legislation
increases mandatory minimum sentences from one year to three years for three narrowly targeted
crimes: selling drugs to minors; using minors to distribute drugs; and trafficking drugs in or near
a school or other protected location.

      Our bill permits judges sentencing youths ages 13 to 15 who are convicted in adult court
       and do not have previous serious violent felony or serious drug offense conviction to
       sentence them as juveniles-- avoiding mandatory minimum penalties entirely.

                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
juvenile offenders have access to similar information as do other victims (e.g., victims would be
able to find out about the status of the proceedings). Fingerprints and photos of delinquents who
have committed the equivalent of an adult felony or a federal gun offense would be sent to the
FBI and made available in the same manner as adult offenders.

      President Clinton has had a longstanding commitment to protect the rights of victims of
       crime. Our bill contains important protections for the rights of victims, including
       victims of crimes committed by juvenile offenders.

      The Administration believes these changes represent a fair balance between maintaining
       important protections for juveniles and expanding the information available to their
       victims.
