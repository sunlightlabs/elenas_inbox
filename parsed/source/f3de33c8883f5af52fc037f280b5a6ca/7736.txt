                       The Commerce Committee Manager's Package
                         will DramaticaUy Reduce Youth Smoking

The Commerce Committee manager's package contains significant improvements over the
underlying bill which will help to reduce youth smoking and to protect the public health. With
these improvements, the bill meets each of the President's principles for comprehensive tobacco
legislation. The improvements include:

Tougher Lookback Surcharges:

      The manager's amendment contains an uncapped company-specific surcharge of$I,OOO
       per youth smoker for every youth smoker by which the company misses its youth
       smoking targets. This surcharge represents twice the lifetime profits that a company
       eams from any youth smoker. The companies will not be able to pass these
       company-specific surcharges onto price, because any prIce differential between
       companies will dramatically affect their share of the adult market.

       At the levels specified in the manager's amendment, company specific surcharges will
       reduce profits by $640 million for every 10 points. The Treasury Department and OMB
       estimate that a 20-point miss in 2003 would represent one-third of total industry profits.
       By affecting their bottom line in this dramatic fashion, the company-specific surcharges
       in the manager's amendment will provide a significant incentive for tobacco companies
       to change their behavior and reduce sales to children.

      The manager's package also raises the cap on industry-wide lookback surcharges from
       $3.5 billion per year to $4 billion per year. The Treasury Department and OMB estimate
       that if targets are not met and the full $4 billion industry-wide surcharge is levied, the
       price of a pack of cigarettes will rise by about 35 cents.

Enhanced Environmental Tobacco Smokc Protections:

      The manager's package provides that a state can opt out of the national environmental
       tobacco smoke standard only if the state is able to demonstrate to OSHA that it has an
       ETS standard at least as protective of the public's health.

Spending:

      The manager's package contains key provisions to fund important public health
       programs, health research, and assistance for farmers. It also provides funding to states
       to be used for a variety of programs, including child care.

      Approximately 22 percent of expected revenues from the legislation will go to fund
       research at NIH, CDC, and AHCPR. Another 22 percent will fund smoking cessation
       programs, prevention and education programs, international tobacco control efforts, and a
       variety of enforcement efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize smuggling
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                   2

      and crack down on retailers who sell tobacco products to children. All proceeds from
      lookback penalties will go to prevention and education programs.

     Forty percent of expected revenues will go to states, with halfumestricted and half to be
      used for designated purposes -- the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the Safe
      and Drug-Free Schools Program, Eisenhower Grants, child. welfare programs (Title
      N-B), the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Title V Program, Substance Abuse grant
      programs, and a limited match for the Children's Health Insurance Program. This entire
      list is directed at the health and well-being of children and families most in need of
      assistance.

     The remainder of expected revenues from the legislation will go to protect tobacco
      farmers and to provide assistance to their communities, through the mechanisms of the
      LEAF Act.

     Excess revenues will go to the Medicare program.

Improved Liability Provisions:

     The manager's package ensures that the bill's liability provisions (i.e., the settlement of
      state lawsuits and the annual damages cap) apply only to companies that agree to accept
      sweeping advertising restrictions and to comply with important provisions of the law (i.e.,
      lookbacks and annual payments), even if those provisions are invalidated by the courts.

     The manager's package raises the annual liability cap from $6.5 to $8 billion (indexed for
      inflation), the same amount as the cap in the Chafee-Harkin bill. It also removes liability
      protections for parent companies and affiliates; ensures that the industry'S attorneys will
      be subject to suit as under current law; and allows plaintiffs claiming injury from disease
      to use evidence of addiction in their lawsuits.

     The manager's package strengthens the provisions in the bill that link liability protections
      to the achievement of youth smoking targets. Under the amended legislation, a company
      that misses its targets by 20 percent or more has the burden of showing both that it did not
      engage in affirmative misconduct and that it used best efforts to reduce youth smoking in
      order to escape the loss of liability protections.

Elimination of Antitrust Exemption:

     The manager's package eliminates the blanket antitrust exemption contained in the
      underlying bill, which was not necessary to achieve the goals of the legislation and could
      have had anti competitive effects.
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                3


Stronger Anti-Smuggling Provisions:

     The manager's amendment will strengthen the anti-smuggling provisions in the bill, so as
      to prevent the emergence of contraband markets. The bill, as amended, will create a
      "closed distribution system" for tobacco products so that only licensed entities can sell or
      buy products; it will provide states with resources to establish or improve retail licensing
      systems; it will require manufacturers to mark packages for export to prevent their
      diversion; and it will establish and enforce strong penalties for violations. A very similar
      system has worked to control smuggling of alcoholic beverages for over sixty years.
