 MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:          GENE SPERLING
                SALLY KATZEN

 RE:            BANKRUPTCY REFORM LEGISLATION

 Last week, the House passed, by a veto-proof majority, a bankruptcy bill that your administration
 said it "strongly opposes." A better, but still flawed, bill (voted out of committee 16-2) may be
 taken up by the Senate before the July 4th recess or soon thereafter. Both bills were changed
 recently to address concerns that you, the First Lady, and others have raised about their impact on
 debtors' capacity to pay child support and alimony, although some problems still remain.

  After an NEC interagency review, your advisors have reached a consensus that some bankruptcy
  reform is important. These bills contain many provisions that are beneficial, including a cap on
  state homestead exemptions, debtor education pilots, penalties for unjustified creditor activities,
  measures to discourage bad-faith repeat filings, and provisions to' improve data collection and
  audit procedures. However, certain controversial provisions of the current bills need significant
. changes to satisfy our objectives and concerns. We propose to advance quickly an
  Administration proposal in hopes of influencing the Senate bill on the floor and giving the
  Administration greater leverage in conference. The proposal would address three issues: (1)
  limitations on access to Chapter 7; (2) new nondischargeable debts and their impact on child
  support and alimony payments; and (3) new provisions to protect against coercive creditor
  behavior and to require more responsibility from creditors in extending credit. The group also
  has identified alternatives to parts of this proposal on which we could compromise, if necessary.

 I.      BACKGROUND

 Rising Consumer Bankruptcies: Despite what Goldman Sachs recently called "the best
 economy ever," personal bankruptcies have continued to rise sharply, from roughly 800,000 in
 1994 to nearly 1.4 million in 1997. Recent figures for the first quarter of 1998 showed another
 20 percent increase over 1997's pace.

 Disputed Causes: There is much dispute about the cause of this increase, but little definitive
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

evidence. Creditors assert that lawyer advertising, reduced social stigma, and increased
information about the financial advantages of bankruptcy have encouraged an increasing number
of consumers to walk away from debts they could pay back. Consumer advocates argue that
lenders have irresponsibly extended too much credit to families who are ill-prepared to handle it,
and that most bankruptcies happen when unexpected events push such a family over the financial
edge; indeed, rising bankruptcy rates track closely rising levels of unsecured debt, although
causation cannot be proven.

Potential for Abuse: Under current rules, some debtors with high incomes walk away from
their debts entirely, even when they have the capacity to repay at least a portion of those debts;
other debtors file repeatedly without any intention of completing bankruptcy, for the purpose of
delaying bona fide collection activities; and generous state exemptions (including unlimited
homestead exemptions in eight states and exemptions for items like race horses and silver spoons
in Virginia) prompt some to shift assets to exempt categories prior to a bankruptcy filing to avoid
making payment to any unsecured creditors. Consumer advocates argue that these cases are not
the norm and should not prompt limits on those who genuinely need bankruptcy's fresh start.

Consumer Impact: Regardless of who is to blame, higher levels of debt charge-offs appear to
raise the cost of credit for everyone. One industry study suggests that bankruptcies cost every
American household between $300-400 per year. Higher credit costs disproportionately fall on
lower-income families, since they are more likely to carry a balance on their card. While in the
past credit card interest rates did not always rise and fall with market rates, the industry is now
more competitive, so that reduced bankruptcies are likely to translate to lower interest rates and
increased access to credit for those who pay their bills.

Legislative Momentum: The popularity of these bills can be explained by the system's
vulnerability to abuse and the apparent consumer costs, as well as an extremeJy effective and
well-financed industry campaign and legislators' fears of being labeled protectors of deadbeats.

II.     LIMITATIONS ON ACCESS TO CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY

Current Law: Today, there is little limit on debtor's access to Chapter 7's full and immediate
discharge of debt (usually with no payments to unsecured creditors); however, in some circuits,
courts find, on their own motion, that it'is "substantial abuse" for a debtor with the ability to
repay 20% of their unsecured debts over three years, after taking account of all necessary
expenses, to go through Chapter 7 rather than a Chapter 13 repayment plan,

House and Senate Bills: Both bills would require those with the capacity to repay a portion of
their debt to do so under a Chapter 13 plan. We opposed the House bill because it determines
access to Chapter 7 under a rigid "means test" that does not take into account the unique
circumstances of individual debtors. The Senate approach is more flexible, building on the
abuse test in use in some circuits. The Senate bill would authorize a bankruptcy judge to apply
this test to any debtor with income above the median and, for the first time, allow creditors to file


                                                  2
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

the motion seeking a detennination of abuse. Creditors would have to pay debtors' attorneys
fees if their filings were not 'substantially justified' or were brought to coerce a debtor to waive a
right.

Administration proposal: We propose a variation on the Senate bill whereby the bankruptcy
court would have discretion to determine whether or not a debtor's use of Chapter 7 is
abuse; however, there would be a presumption of abuse if a debtor has an income above
the median and the capacity to repay either at least 30% of her debts or some specified
amount (such as $5000) over three years. (No debtor would be denied access to Chapter 7
unless she had the ability to repay a minimum of$50 a month in unsecured, nonpriority debt.
Any lesser amount is too small to merit the Chapter 13 administrative costs or to risk the chance
that the creditor was pursuing the motion to coerce the debtor to forgo another bankruptcy right.)
  We also would provide that, if a debtor moved more than $50,000 from nonexempt to exempt
assets within one year of the filing, she would be subject to a presumption of abuse, regardless of
income. In detennining a debtor's capacity to repay, we propose to explicitly exclude luxuries
(e.g., expensive cars or boats) from necessary expenses.

These presumptive guidelines could be overcome if the court detennined, e.g., that the debtor
faced unusual but necessary expenses or could not be expected to maintain reliably her current
level of income. Such presumptive guidelines have proven to be highly effective in promoting
unifonnity and fairness in establishing child support award amounts. Since the average debtor
under Chapter 13 repays 20% of her debts and has income below the national median, those who
meet this higher threshold are the most likely to succeed under a repayment plan.

III.   NONDISCHARGEABLE DEBT AND ITS IMPACT ON CHILD SUPPORT AND
       ALIMONY

The Bankruptcy Code makes debts nondischargeable only where there is an overriding public
purpose, as with child support, alimony, educational loans, tax obligations, or debts incurred by
fraud. The House and Senate bills have provisions that would broaden the categories of
nondischargeable credit card debt, although the largest new category has been dropped and the
two remaining categories narrowed. These provisions raise two questions: (1) Do the
additional debts made nondischargeable by these bills rise to the same level of public priority as
other nondischargeable debts? and (2) What impact does the protection of new categories of del?t
have on the ability of the debtor, post-bankruptcy, to repay existing categories of
nondischargeable debt (e.g., child support and alimony, educational loans, and taxes)? They
also force us to recognize that consumers use credit cards today for many purposes that were
inconceivable only a few years ago (e.g., groceries or paying student loans). This
Administration envisions -- and, in fact, encourages -- greater use of electronic commerce.

       Debts incurred to pay other non dischargeable debts.

Current law: If a debtor uses a credit card to pay federal taxes, the credit card debt is


                                                  3
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
nondischargeable.
House and Senate bills:     Both make a debt incurred to pay any nondischargeable debt
nondischargeable, although the Senate effectively eliminates the provision if the debtor is a
single parent or owes child support and/or alimony.

Administration Proposal: We propose that the current law remain unchanged; however, if a
debtor paid a nondischargeable debt with a credit card, it would be a factor in determining
whether the debtor's use of Chapter 7 was abuse.

       Debts incurred in the period immediately before bankruptcy.

Current Law: Debts for luxuries over $1000 owed to a single creditor within 60 days of
bankruptcy are nondischargeable. There is some evidence that this provision and other
anti-fraud provisions do not prevent some debtors from running up debt knowing that a discharge
is likely.

House and Senate Bills: Both would make all debts incurred within 90 days of bankruptcy for
luxuries be presumptively nondischargeable. In addition, they would make presumptively
nondischargeable debt above ($250 in the House; $400 in the Senate) per credit card for
necessaries during the same period.

Administration Proposal: We propose to agree to make debt for luxuries within 90 days of
bankruptcy presumptively nondischargeable; however, a cap of $250 or $400 on necessary
expenses incurred prior to bankruptcy is inappropriate. One can easily imagine a family, in
the months prior to bankruptcy, paying for rent, school clothes, and even groceries on their credit
card. Courts can easily compare current spending patterns to prior spending and determine
whether charges are truly for necessary expenses.

       Child Support and Alimony Considerations

We should note that the current bills have seven different new provisions designed to either
mitigate the impact of the additional nondischargeable debt on payment of child support and
alimony or to give child support and alimony additional protections in and after bankruptcy.
Some experts we have consulted argue that the benefits provided by these additional provisions
outweigh any modest harm to child support and alimony payments that remains from the
nondischargeability provisions. On the other hand, the women's groups continue their
opposition to these bills. Moreover, these provisions, which focus only on child support and
alimony, do not address our policy concern that new nondischargeable debt will now compete
with other types of existing nondischargeable debts, such as educational loans. For these
reasons, the Administration proposals described above would allow only one small category of
new nondischargeable debt (luxuries purchased 90 days before bankruptcy) where there is a
policy argument against allowing run-up prior to bankruptcy; for the remaining categories, we
would leave current law or address the problem a different way.

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

IV.    ADDITIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AGAINST PREDATORY
       CREDITOR PRACTICES

Your advisors are particularly concerned about the unequal bargaining power of the creditor and
debtor and how the changes in bankruptcy rules could further shift the balance and create
opportunities for coercion and consumer harm. To address this concern, and to ensure
legislation requires responsibility of both debtor and creditor, we propose new consumer
protections.

       Reaffirmations of Unsecured Debt

Although debtors in Chapter 7 have a right to have their unsecured debts discharged, some
debtors reaffirm one or more debts. While there may be some circumstances in which it is in the
debtor's best interest to do so (e.g., as a condition of obtaining a line of credit needed for a small
business), those cases are few. The risk is real, however, that debtors are pressured into
reaffirming their debts by aggressive creditors. After Sears recently paid large penalties for such
practices, another Bankruptcy Judge (Fenning) said she scrutinized her court records and found
evidence of widespread coercive reaffirmations. Since debts reaffirmed survive bankruptcy,
they compete with child support and alimony in a post-bankruptcy world. Eliminating coercive
reaffirmations also would help to reduce the current level of competition child support and
alimony payments face.

Current Law: Disclosures are required and the court must determine that a reaffirmation does
not impose an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependant and is in the debtor's best interest;
however, an affirmation of the debtor's attorney to that effect suffices.

House and Senate Bills: No related provisions.

Administration Proposal: We propose to require the court itself to find that there was a
compelling reason for the debtor to reaffirm a debt, without reliance on counsel affidavits. We
also propose to bar reaffirmation of debts that add attorneys' fees and costs to the debt, to
increase penalties on attempts to enforce invalid reaffirmations, and to clarify on that the
automatic stay bars threats to file abuse motions and solicitations of reaffirmations.

       Credit Card Minimum Payment Disclosure

We also believe that some signal should be sent to creditors about lending practices that entice
debtors to get further and further into debt.

Current Law: Most debtors believe that by making the minimum payment on their credit card
they are slowing working off their debt. However, depending upon the interest rate, they may be


                                                  5
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
falling further and further behind. Creditors are increasingly offering minimum payment plans
that amortize debt over decades, if at all.

House and Senate bills: No related provisions.

Administration Proposal: We propose a process for subordinating debt if the creditor did not
disclose clearly to the debtor the time period over which the debt would amortize at the minimum
payment level. The subordinated debt would only be paid, in a Chapter 13 plan or a Chapter 7
liquidation, after all other unsecured, nonpriority debt. It most cases, this will mean it will never
be repaid.

       Other Non-Bankruptcy Steps to Improve Consumer Credit Practices

We also are exploring whether there are other non-bankruptcy steps we can take to clamp down
on predatory lender practices and better help consumers to understand their own borrowing. We
have consensus on a proposal that requires all lenders to disclose the time period over which debt
is amortized by minimum payments. This proposal, and others under review, fall under the
jurisdiction of other committees. Thus, it is not feasible to insist that Congress include these
proposals in the bankruptcy bill at this time. However, we might unveil these proposals in
connection with a campaign to educate consumers about the use of credit, using the bully pulpit
the way we have done to encourage retirement savings.

V.     ADVISORS' RECOMMENDATIONS

All your advisors recommend we proceed as described, including CoS, NEC, Counsel, OPL,
OLA, OMB, CEA, DPC, First Lady, DoJ, Treasury, Commerce, and Education.

      The NEC believes that requiring greater responsibility of both creditors and debtors is the
       best way to address the "unclean hands" of some of the legislation's proponents.
      Treasury and CEA emphasize that needs-based reform will decrease the cost of, and
       increase access to, credit for those debtors who do pay their bills by limiting opportunistic
       bankruptcy among those higher income debtors who do not.
      DoJ supports the plan and stresses that other provisions of these bills, like the cap on state
       homestead exemptions, measures to discourage bad faith repeat filings, and provisions to
       improve data collection and audit procedures, are important reforms.
      OPL believes that, while consumer advocates oppose any bill, reforms limiting access to
       Chapter 7 and stemming coercive reaffirmations appear valid. OPL wants to see us fight
       for aspects of our proposal that protect against any impact on child support (before or
       after bankruptcy) of new nondischargeable credit card debt.
      The First Lady's Office strongly supports advancing proposals that achieve more
       balanced reform by calling for responsibility on the part of the creditor as well as the
       debtor, and recommends that we continue to focus on the child support issue to ensure
