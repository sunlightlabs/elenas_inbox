                                        March XX, 1997


             Last summer we made a new beginning on one of our nation's most vexing
problems: the welfare system. When I signed the historic welfare reform law we set out to
honor a moral
obligation for our nation, to help many people in our national community to help themselves.
This law dramatically changed the nation's welfare system so that it will no longer fail our people
by trapping so many families in a cycle of dependency. Instead, it now helps people move from
welfare to work. It does so by requiring work of every able-bodied person while offering each
person the opportunity and supports necessary to move into the labor market.

        The new welfare law, combined with the aggressive welfare waiver strategy I pursued as
soon as I took office, have moved record numbers of people off welfare and into work. Over the
past four years, the welfare rolls have dropped by an unprecedented 2.5 million people. That's the
largest reduction in the welfare rolls in history. Of the 2.5 million people who have moved off
welfare, approximately a million of them moved into jobs.

       The success we have seen so far is a result of public and private sector hiring across the
nation. And everyday, more organizations and more people become involved in the effort.
Recently, the CEOs of five major corporations pledged to create programs and work with other
corporations to hire welfare recipients. Leaders in the Faith community similarly committed to
helping welfare recipients find jobs.

        Now, with this Directive, I will ask all agencies in the Federal government to formalize
what they really have already been doing to make welfare a success. With help from the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) and others in the Administration, I have crafted the following
steps to formalize and expand upon the Federal government's efforts to hire and retain welfare
recipients.

1.     Direct each federal agency to present to you in 30 days a plan for hiring and
       retaining welfare recipients in Federal government positions.

The agency plan should include the following:

A.     A survey of Agency hiring capacity under all hiring authorities

Each agency would work through the Federal Executive Boards (FEBs) and the Federal
Executive Associations (FEAs) around the country to survey where the agency can hire welfare
recipients and in what sort of jobs.

While we would encourage agencies to pursue all hiring options -- excepted hiring
authorities as well as the normal competitive hiring process -- the excepted hiring
authorities, particularly the Worker-Trainee program, are the most viable avenues through
which to hire welfare recipients.
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


The five existing excepted service programs are each targeted to a specific group and boast
simplified hiring procedures: the Veteran's Readjustment Appointment Program; the
Severely Handicapped Appointment Program; the Presidential Management Intern
Program; the Student Career Experience Program; and the Worker-Trainee Program.

The Worker-Trainee program was designed to attract low-skilled persons into the Federal
workforce. It is a quick and easy way to hire individuals into trainee-type positions where
needed training in basic skills and developmental experiences are offered. Provisions of the
program include the following:

      May hire individuals at grades GS-l, WG-l, WG-2, or the equivalent
      May promote to grades GS-3, WG-4, or the equivalent
      Initial appointment is a term like appointment
      After three years, may convert to career status

B.      A plan describing in detail how the agency would reach out to welfare offices,
employment offices, nonprofit organizations, and others that work with the welfare population on
a regular basis to notiry them of job opportunities within the Federal government.

C.       A plan describing in detail how each agency would prepare and mentor welfare recipients
who are hired by the Federal government to ensure that once hired, the welfare recipient retains
her job.

D.      A plan on the manner in which the agency, through the FEBs and FEAs, will report
regularly to the President on both the hiring and retention of welfare recipients.

To offer welfare recipients incentives to move into the Federal workforce and to help those
already employed remain employed, I am issuing thefollowing directives.

1.      I direct the General Services Administration (GSA) to issue in 30 days from these
directive, guidelines to Federal agencies on uses of the Federal Fare Subsidy Program,
including the option to offer fare subsidies on a sliding income basis, as allowed under the
Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act.

The 1993 Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act permits the Secretary of each Federal
agency to establish programs that may involve such options as transit fare subsidies including
passes, vouchers, and other cash reimbursement. As of 1994, only 10 agencies offered transit
fare subsidies to 31,000 employees. The low usage exists because of the high cost of offering all
employees fare subsidies.

These guidelines should clarify that agencies have legal authority to offer graduated
subsidies based on income and directs agencies to do so. If agencies choose to offer fare
subsidies on a sliding income scale basis, usage rates will likely rise and will directly benefit
low-income workers who may otherwise have difficulty affording transportation to and from
                                                                 Hex-Dump Comersion
work.


2.     I direct the GSA to work with OPM and the National Performance Review (NPR) to
inform Federal agencies of their option to contract with local child care resource and
referral agencies around the country. I also direct the GSA, with OPM and NPR, to
explore and report on initiating contractual arrangements with GSA to offer resource and
referral services on a government-wide basis.

Under current law, Federal agencies have the option to contract with local child care
resource and referral agencies. Resource and referral agencies are a cost-effective option to
offer Federal employees individualized child care referrals that take into account an
employee's income, geography, specific child care needs, and other factors. While there
are over 500 local referral and resource agencies around the country, few Federal agencies
take advantage of this option to contract with them, though it is more affordable to a
Federal agency than offering on-site child car, and gives employees a variety of care and
cost options.


3.     I further direct the GSA to work with all Federal government agencies to report to
you in 30 days each agency's plans to help low-income federal workers find affordable
child care.

The report should include but not be limited to the following:

A.    The extent to which the agency has already contracted with local child care resource
and referral services to help low-income employees find affordable child care and the
agency's plan to expand the use of this option.

B.     The capacity in existing non-DOD Federal agency-sponsored child care centers and
plans to expand usage and capacity.

C.     Agency interest in offering direct child care subsidies based on a sliding fee scale to
low-income employees of the Federal government. Currently, the Department of Defense,
under the Military Child Care Act of 1989, operates subsidized child care centers for its
employees. DOD absorbs the cost of this program. If agencies are interested in creating a
child care subsidy program similar to DOD's, legislation would be required.


4.       I direct e~ch U.S. Secretary to notify all employees who are eligible for the
Earned-Income tax Credit (EITC) of both their eligibility and their ability to receive EITC
monies each month in their paychecks. Further, I direct the Department of Treasury to
work with OPM to educate U.S. Secretaries and their personnel directors about the EITC
including employees' option to receive EITC monies on a regular each month in their
paychecks.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


Currently, each Federal agency has been encouraged to notify its eligible employees of the EITC
and their ability to receive it in an advance payment. However, not all agencies do so. We
must ensure that eligible Federal employees know of all benefits to help them make work pay
more than welfare and that the Secretaries and their personnel directors understand and are aware
of these options.

To offer Federal employers incentives to hire welfare recipients, I am calling for new
legislation.

I am calling for legislation to allow the Federal government and its agencies to utilize the
wage subsidy program in the same manner any other private nonprofit or for-profit
employer would use the program to subsidize the wages of a welfare recipient.

Under current law, federal agencies cannot take advantage of subsidies offered to
employers who hire welfare recipients, because agencies may not receive any
unappropriated funds. Legislation would allow federal agencies to accept and retain these
subsidies, thus giving agencies the same incentives to hire welfare recipients as other
employers.
