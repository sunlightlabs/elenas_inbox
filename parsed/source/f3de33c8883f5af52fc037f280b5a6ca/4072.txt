MEMORANDUM FOR SYLVIA MATHEWS

FROM:         Richard Hayes
              DawnChirwa
              Susan Liss
              Emil Parker

RE:            Civil Rights Enforcement

       As you requested, and as part of the ongoing work of the President's Race Initiative, we
have begun discussing policy initiatives designed to enhance federal civil rights enforcement.
As we proceed, we thought it would be useful to provide you with some background on the
various civil rights enforcement offices which exist, their funding levels, current projects
underway and previous Administration efforts to improve federal civil rights enforcement.

       In addition, this memorandum seeks your approval to proceed with forming a working
group composed of the Civil Rights chiefs in the major enforcement agencies to develop a
comprehensive civil rights enforcement strategy. (Deval Patrick and Chris Edley chaired such a
group in response to the President's directive to mend affirmative action programs in 1995.)
We think the responsible federal agencies need to be part of our discussions to ensure their
support of any changes or enhancements we recommend.

I.     Federal Civil Rights Enforcement Agencies

        Over the past five years, the Clinton Administration has worked diligently to enforce the
laws which protect the rights ofthose who have been discriminated against based on age,
disability, gender, race, religion, and sexual orientation by supporting civil rights enforcement
programs that effectively aid each of those groups. This work is accomplished through the
oversight responsibilities of the following agencies.

       A. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division

       The Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice is charged with enforcing the Civil
Rights Act of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. These statutes deal with eliminating
discrimination in education, employment, credit, housing, public accommodations and facilities,
voting and some federally funded and conducted programs. The Civil Rights Division, along
with the Associate Attorney General, the Office of Legal Counsel and the Solicitor General has
primary responsibility among the federal agencies for enforcing federal civil rights laws in the
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                -2-
 courts and for providing legal counsel to agencies with respect to statutory and constitutional
 civil rights issues.

        B. Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).

          OFCCP is part of the Employment Standards Administration at the U.S. Department of
  Labor. OFCCP' s jurisdiction covers approximately 26 million or nearly 22% of the total
  civilian workforce (92,500 non-construction establishments and 100,000 construction
. establishments). Its primary responsibility is to enforce Executive Order 11246 under which all
  federal contractors, as a condition of receiving government funds, are required to refrain from
  discrimination and take good faith efforts -- including affirmative action -- to expand
  employment opportunities for qualified women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. In
  addition, OFCCP is charged with enforcing Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and
  the affirmative action provisions of Section 4212 of the Vietnam Era Veteran's Readjustment
  Assistance Act.

         The OFCCP employs various enforcement procedures, such as compliance reviews and
 complaint investigations of federal contractors' personnel policies and procedures, to enforce
 these statutes. OFCCP's current high priority initiatives include its public education initiative,
 introduction of its Fair Enforcement Strategy, and launching its tester's initiative.

        C. Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC)

        The EEOC is an independent agency whose primary goal is to ensure fair labor practices
for employees who belong to minority groups that have experienced historical and current
discrimination on the basis of race, gender, disability, national origin, religion and age. In
particular, the EEOC is responsible for enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Section 501 ofthe Rehabilitation
Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and, pursuant to Executive Order 12067, providing
coordination among the federal agencies involved in equal employment opportunity issues.

        D. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

         HUD's Office for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity enforces the Fair Housing Act that
prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex,
familial status, and disability. One of the major enforcement mechanisms employed by HUD in
this area is the use of "testers" to uncover acts of housing discrimination. HUD attorneys also
litigate complaints on behalf of persons whose allegations of discrimination have been deemed
valid by HUD. Current priority civil rights-related projects within HUD include: (1) wide use of
volunteers in testing; (2) a national advertising campaign; (3) "Make 'em pay" - a civil
counterpart to the Department of Justice's project directed at perpetrators of hate crimes; and (4)
the Presidential Housing task force.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                 -3-
        E. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights

          The Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education (OCR) seeks to secure equal
.access to education regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age under Title VI
 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of
 the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and the Americans with
 Disabilities Act of 1990. OCR's primary tasks include compliance reviews at educational
 institutions and providing technical assistance to institutions to promote voluntary compliance.
 Several high priority issues within OCR include: (1) English proficiency issues; (2) over
 representation of minorities in special education courses; (3) under representation of women and
 minorities in math; and (4) desegregation.

        F. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Civil Rights

        The Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services is
responsible for enforcing several statutes. These include Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the Age Discrimination Act of 1975; Title
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; Section 407 of the Drug Abuse Offense and
Treatment Act of 1972; Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act; Section 307 of the
Family Violence Prevention and Service Act; EEO provisions of the Communication Finance
Act of 1934; the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and
Rehabilitation Act of 1972; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The
current emphasis within OCR at HHS is placed on: (1) enforcement of the inter-ethnic adoption
provision of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996; (2) medical redlining; and (3)
providing govermnent-wide guidance on non-discrimination in temporary assistance for needy
families.

II.     Federal Resources for Civil Rights Enforcement

        The President's FY '98 budget increased the total funding for civil rights enforcement
programs from $470.8 million to $480.32 million. (See chart below.) You should note that the
EEOC and OFCCP budgets were increased, while the budgets for other relevant agencies were
either frozen at FY '97 enacted levels, with no adjustment for inflation, or decreased slightly.
The President's budget requested $246 million for the EEOC, an increase of $6.3 million over
the FY '97 enacted level of$239.7 million. The OFCCP budget was increased from $56 million
to $59 million. Unfortunately, neither the House nor the Senate Commerce, Justice, State
Appropriations bills fully funds the President's FY 1998 request of $246 million for the
EEOC -- the House bill freezes funding at the FY 1997 level of$239.7 million, while the Senate
bill provides $242 million.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

III.   Summary of Administration Efforts to Improve Civil Rights Enforcement

         This Administration has undertaken two major projects to reinvent Civil Rights
Enforcement. The Vice President's National Performance Review recommended improvements
in civil rights enforcement at the EEOC and OFCCP. In addition, the President's affirmative
action review made several recommendations about how to make OFCCP more effective.

       A.   National Performance Review

               1. EEOC

       With the appointment of new Commissioners in 1994, a primary focus ofthe EEOC has
been on decreasing its historically large backlog. Their adoption of the Priority Charge
Handling Procedures in July 1995, and the aaoption of the National Enforcement Plan (NEP) in
February 1996, have resulted in more timely and effective resolution of the agency's pending
inventory of charges.

        The Priority Charge Handling System establishes an "ABC" priority system, under which
cases are ranked -- "A," "B" or "C" -- based upon the strength of a particular complaint. This
enables the EEOC to weed out unmeritorious cases and devote more time and resources to
meritorious ones. Adoption of this Priority Charge Handling system has reduced the backlog of
cases at the EEOC by approximately 25,000 cases. None-the-Iess, the agency continues to have
a large backlog.

       The National Enforcement Plan (NEP) is a three-pronged program .. The aim is to
dedicate available funds to prevention of discrimination as one of the most efficient and effective
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
                                             -5-
means to aid in the achievement of equal employment opportunity goals. This is accomplished
through educational outreach, voluntary resolution of disputes, with strong enforcement
remaining as a measure to be used where the other two fail.

              2. OFCCP

        In order to improve its effectiveness while making contractors' compliance simpler and
less burdensome, the OFCCP has enacted a Fair Enforcement Strategy. This expedited and
more flexible tiered review process will enable the agency to concentrate on the most substantive
violations while spending less time on reviews of firms that are largely in compliance. They
also hope to modernize their computer systems to streamline the agency's internal procedures
and reduce unnecessary paperwo~k requirements, permitting the office, for example, to accept
electronically submitted reports from contractors.

       B. President's Affirmative Action Review

              1. EEOC

        In 1995, the President ordered a comprehensive review of affirmative action programs.
This review found that the EEOC was severely under funded, and recommended that additional
resources be provided to help it run effectively. It was also recommended that EEOC should
work with the Office of Personnel Management to evaluate the performance of its managers and
with the President's Management Council (PMC) to study and report on the proper use of
flexible goals and timetables for hiring and promotions. The review also recommended that the
PMC identify those agencies that are best able to promote diversity and equal opportunity and
implement similar mechanisms throughout the government.

              2. OFCCP

        The review revealed that although generally effective, OFCCP programs needed
reforming. Academic research showed that during periods of strong enforcement, OFCCP
programs resulted in moderate increases in the employment of minorities and that OFCCP's
efforts did not cause employers to hire less qualified workers. At the same time, the review
found that there is a great need to reduce affirmative action program paperwork. Contractors
also expressed discontent with inconsistent enforcement between regions.

        Several recommendations were made to the President on how to change and improve the
OFCCP. First, the Secretary of Labor should update administrative guidelines on enforcement
of non-discrimination, illegality of quotas, and good faith efforts. Second, the Secretary of
Labor should investigate methods that would encourage collaboration with the private sector.
Lastly, the Department of Labor should implement its plan to reduce paperwork.

IV.    Congressional Civil Rights Enforcement Initiatives
                                                                    /Ul10tnated Records Management System

        Currentiy,both the House and the Senate have proposed simUilrrmt'li,~~:~8~3 and S.71
that are aimed at amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of
1964 to "give more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on
the basis of sex, and for any other purpose." The proposed bills attempt to eliminate the
disparity in wages between males and females. Moreover, the bills require the EEOC to compel
certain
employers to maintain payroll records and report the infonnation to the EEOC which will then
analyze the data in regards to race, sex and national origin of employees.
        Additionally, these bills require the EEOC to train its employees, employers and others
on discrimination in wage payment. The Secretary of Labor will be required to conduct studies
and provide infonnation to employers, labor organizations and the public on any progress in pay
equity. Moreover, these bills reward those employers that make substantial efforts to
eliminating disparities in wages by awarding to them the Robert Reich National Award for Pay
Equity in the Workplace.

v.     Recommendations on a Proposed Working Group on Civil Rights Enforcement

        It is certain that additional resources need to be appropriated for civil rights enforcement
at the EEOC and other agencies in future fiscal years to effectively serve the tens of thousands of
Americans who annually seek their rights. OMB needs to be made aware that the
Administration will seek additional funds in the FY 1999 budget to enforce anti-discrimination
laws and that this needs to be built into the upcoming budget process. However, beyond just
simply proposing additional expenditures, there are a number of other issues we need to examine
in detennining how federal civil rights enforcement can be enhanced. For example:

       (1)     Should we prioritize enforcement efforts on particular areas, and if so on which
               areas: Employment? Housing? Education? Hate crimes? Old Age?
               Disabilities? Housing? etc.

       (2)     Are there additional reinvention activities that we should pursue, even though this
               may result in resources being diverted from current projects?

       (3)     Can the EEOC and OFCCP be made to work more effectively both individually
               and collectively?

       (4)     Is there duplication in the current system that we should eliminate?

       (5)     Do we need to strengthen the existing laws on the books?

       (6)     How do we encourage more voluntary efforts by corporate America and others?

       To address these and other issues, we propose fonning a working group to come up with
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
                                               -7-
a proposal for a comprehensive strategy on civil rights enforcement. We would chair this group,
which would consist of the major agency civil rights chiefs as listed below. Judith Winston or
her representative would be invited to participate; it will be critical that the working group work
collaborative1y with her and her staff. We might also want to include EPA (responsible for
Administration's environmental justice effort), and Treasury/Comptroller of the currency
(responsible for regulating banking practices with respect to loans). Otherwise, the members of
the group will include:


               1. Gilbert Casellas, Chairman, EEOC
               2. Isabe1e Pinzler, Acting Assistant Attorney General, DOJ
               3. Bemie Anderson, Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards, DOL
               4. Shirley Wilcher, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Federal Contract
               Compliance Programs, DOL
               5. Dennis Hayashi, Director, Office of Civil Rights, HHS
               6. Norma Cantu, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, EDUC
               7. George Robertson, Acting Director, Office of Civil Rights Enforcement,
               Agriculture
               8. Susan Forward, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing & Equal
                      Opportunity, HUD
               9. April Marchese, Acting Director, Office of Civil Rights, DOT
               10. Mary Francis Berry, Chairman, Commission on Civil Rights

        As for process, we would convene the working group early in September. The group
would review our progress to date with respect to civil rights enforcement and come up with a
comprehensive set of proposals aimed at strengthening Federal efforts to eradicate racial
discrimination. We would also propose to examine what kinds of cooperative efforts might be
possible with employers and others in addressing this issue, and the need for additional federal
legislation and funding and whether the current priorities of the agencies are the ones the
Administration wants to focus on. We propose that the work of this group will either be
completed or at an appropriate stage so that any requests for additional funding for civil rights
enforcement can be incorporated into the FY 1999 budget before the President submits his
budget to the Congress in January.

       We look forward to hearing your thoughts concerning our recommendation.
