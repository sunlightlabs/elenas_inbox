          "We've got to prove that we did the right thing in welfare reform for all the American people that are willing to do the right
thing by themselves. their children. and our country."
                                                                                       -- President Bill Clinton

AN UNPRECEDENTED DECLINE IN WELFARE ROLLS. Today, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna
Shalala announced that welfare caseloads have declined to roughly 8.4 millIon recipients and slightly over 3 million
families as of June 1998. These caseload numbers continue a trend of dramatic reductions in welfare recipients since
President Clinton took office:

        The number of recipients on welfare has dropped by more than 41 percent, including a decline of more
         than 30 percent since the enactment of welfare reform legislation in 1996;

        There are 5.7 million fewer recipients on the welfare rolls, and 3.8 million fewer recipients since the
         President signed welfare reform legislation in 1996;

        Welfare rolls continue to decline steadily, with nearly 2 percent reductions each month, double the rate for
         the same period in 1997.

A NEW INITIATIVE TO HELP STATES DEVISE WELFARE TO WORK STRATEGIES. Today, the Department of Health
and Human Services is announcing the issuance of grants to 13 states to provide technical assistance on sharing
information about existing job retention strategies for welfare recipients and the methods for evaluating these strategies
with current and former welfare recipients. In addition, a contract has been approved for a private sector company to
provide: (1) technical and evaluation assistance to grantees for the purpose of defming, developing, and refming job
retention and advancement intervention strategies, (2) expert technical and evaluation assistance, (3) review of the field
operations of grantees to document job retention/advancement focused program elements.

BUILDING ON A RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT. In 1996, President Clinton signed sweeping welfare reform legislation
aimed at moving welfare recipients onto the payrolls. Since then, efforts to move people off the welfare rolls and onto
the payrolls include:

        Welfare-To-Work Grants, As part of the balanced budget legislation signed last year, the Administration
         fought for $3 billion in welfare-to-work grants, to help move long-term welfare recipients into lasting
         unsubsidizedjobs. Welfare-to-Work grants allocated by the Department of Labor allow localities to target the
         needs of welfare recipients in their communities. Among the services these grants can provide are job
         placement, on-the-job training, community service jobs and other work experience opportunities, employment
         assistance for non-custodial parents, and job retention services such as child care, transportation, and substance
         abuse treatment.
        The Welfare-To-Work Coalition To Sustain Success. Last year, the Vice President launched the
         Welfare-to-Work Coalition to Sustain Success, a cooperative effort among national civic, service, and
         faith-based organizations that work with states and local agencies to help those moving from welfare to work
         succeed on the job. This partnership includes such groups as the YMCA, YWCA, Salvation Army, United
         Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, Goodwill, and the Women's Missionary Union, who provide mentoring, job
         training, child care transportation and other support to help these workers with the transition to self-sufficiency,

        The Welfare-to-Work Partnership, an independent, non-partisan effort by companies nationwide to hire
         welfare recipients that was launched just over a year ago. The Welfare-to-Work Partnership is making great
         progress, over 5,000 companies of all sizes have joined this partnership and 135,000 former welfare recipients
         have been hired. In addition, the Partnership has released a report, The Road to Retention, that includes case
         histories of 16 businesses, showing that retention rates for former welfare recipients are higher than for
         non-welfare hires.
