(Senate Floor)




H.R. 4193 -- DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
           AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsors:  Stevens (R), Alaska; Gorton (R), Washington)

                      .                       .
        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on H.R. 4193, the Department of the Interior and
Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate
Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the AdministrationD,s
views would be appreciated. Due to inadequate funding levels for priority
programs and at least 21 objectionable language riders, discussed below,
the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill if
it were presented to him as approved by the Committee.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Senate to
accommodate certain of the PresidentD,s priorities within the 302(b)
allocation. However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the
necessary investments in programs funded by this bill. The only way to
achieve the appropriate investment level is to offset discretionary
spending by using savings in other areas.

          The President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary
spending for FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by
making savings in mandatory and other programs available to help finance
this spending.  In the Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad,
bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface
transportation programs together with mandatory offsets. In addition, this
year, as in the past, such mandatory offsets have been approved by the
House and Senate in other appropriations bills. The Administration urges
the Congress to consider such mandatory proposals for other priority
discretionary programs, including those funded through this bill.

Departments of the Interior and Agriculture

        The Administration strongly objects to inadequate funding provided
by the Committee for high priority programs within these two departments,


including:

 Everglades restoration and other land acquisition funding from the Land
and Water Conservation Fund;

  the Clean Water Action Plan to clean up AmericaO,s ground and surface
waterways;

 the Disaster Information Network providing enhanced data to protect
Americans;

 BIA education operations and construction, the Indian Country law
enforcement initiative, and the land consolidation pilot project and other
trust system reforms;


 the Endangered Species Programs, including landowner incentive grants;

 Forest Service General Administration account, thereby significantly
complicating the Administration's efforts at financial reform;

 Forest Service Ecosystem Planning, Inventory and Monitoring, wildlife and
Fisheries Management, Rangeland Management, Watershed Improvement, and
Road Maintenance while effectively increasing the Forest System timber
program by $20 million; and,

 specific earmarks for many unrequested projects that would limit the land
management agencies' ability to allocate funds for high priority needs.

        The Administration urges the Senate to report a clean bill that
does not attempt to roll back environmental protections and circumvent the
public hearing process by attaching riders to appropriation bills.
Unfortunately, the Committee bill contains at least 21 objectionable
riders, 20 in bill language and two additional ones in report language.
The Administration strongly objects to such language,  including
provisions that would:

 unwisely terminate the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management
Project in six Northwest States;

 establish an unprecedented easement for the community of King Cove for a
road and utilities across a wilderness area in Alaska in the Izembek
National Wildlife Refuge;

         mandate a high timber sale level on the Tongass National Forest
in Alaska, regardless of environmental impacts, other resource priorities,
and the ongoing public process for finalizing the Tongass Forest Plan;

 continue to delay rules that would establish the fair market value for
Federal and Indian oil leases, costing the Treasury $64 million a year in
underpaid royalties;

 delay implementation of environmental protections for hardrock mining
reclamation on Federal lands;



         institute for the first time a means-test for tribes as a basis for
redistributing Tribal Priority Allocation funding;


 amend an authorizing statute, the 1992 Elwha Act, to significantly change
the congressionally approved plan for restoring Elwha River and Olympic
National park and leave the National Park Service owning two non-compliant
dams without the funds to remove them;

 hinder efforts to restore endangered and threatened Pacific salmon runs
in the Columbia and Snake Rivers;

 require the Forest Service to maximize commercial wood harvesting before
the agency conducts prescribed burning projects, effectively stopping most
prescribed burns and endangering lives and property;

 prohibit Grizzly Bear reintroduction into the Selway-Bitteroot area of
Idaho and Montana;

 prohibit Park Service regulation of commercial fishing in Glacier Bay
National Park in Alaska;

 undermine the CFO Act and the responsibilities of USDA top management by
encouraging the Forest Service to select and implement a financial
computer system that is independent of the Department of Agriculture;

 transfer the jurisdiction over the valued Land Between The Lakes National
Recreation Area from the Tennessee Valley Authority, where it has been
successfully managed for over thirty-five years, to the U.S. Forest
Service, a disruptive change that would involve additional transition
costs without improving service;

 place unnecessary limits on Federal land acquisitions in Alaska;

 prevent the Forest Service from charging fair market value for summer
vacation homes in an Idaho national forest, undermining the current effort
to reappraise all such leases nationwide;

 require the Forest Service to trade timber in return for restoration
practices, an adverse precedent that could devolve into a perpetual cycle
of using logging to pay for land management;



 require unauthorized four-wheel-drive roads to be obliterated before any
other type of road can be decommissioned, virtually preventing work·on
regular roads that pose serious environmental risks and are ready to be
removed;

 waive environmental laws and automatically extend the term of grazing
leases that are undergoing review by the Bureau of Land Management even
though authority already exists to protect lease holders from termination
of leases undergoing review;

 force the Forest Service to sell all Alaskan timber sales using an
outdated, impracticable appraisal method that undermines the public return
on national forest management; and,

 prohibit the Department of the Interior from using FY 1999 funds to
transfer land into trust status in Minnesota, setting a precedent for
limitations on trust land acquisition.

        In addition, the Senate Committee Report includes objectionable
language, including language that would:



 require timber sale offers from national forests to be 3.8 billion board
feet rather than the 3.4 billion board feet assumed in the FY 1999 Budget;
and,

 direct the National Park Service to maintain aviation access to a gravel
airstrip within the Denali National Park, effectively overturning a 1997
Environmental Impact Statement calling for eventually closing the airstrip
and relying on a paved airstrip 10 miles away.

Land and Water Conservation Fund

        The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's deep cuts
in land acquisition funding to protect our national parks, forests,
refuges, and public lands. The Committee has provided only $233 million
of the $270 million requested, with Everglades land acquisition funds cut
by half. This reduction in funding would prevent the Administration from
making significant land acquisitions such as Cumberland Island National
Seashore in Georgia and West Eugene Wetland in Oregon.

         The Administration also objects to the CommitteeU,s continued
inaction on the promised congressional release of the $362 million
appropriated in FY 1998 for Federal priority land acquisitions.  As
requested by Congress, the Administration has submitted a list of proposed
land acquisitions.  In response, the Committee has not only held back the
FY 1998 Title V funding but also has funded some items on the
AdministrationO,s 1998 list with FY 1999 funding, resulting in critical
acquisitions planned for both years being delayed or unfunded.
Millennium Program

        The Administration appreciates very much the $13 million provided to the
National Park Service and the Smithsonian for Millennium Program
projects. We strongly urge the Senate to provide full funding with
maximum flexibility and discretion for allocation in order to preserve
other important cultural and historic treasures for the next millennium
that are in danger of deteriorating beyond repair.  Many of these projects
are urgent and cannot be delayed.

Department of Energy

        While higher than the House Committee mark, the Senate Committee's
funding level represents a very objectionable $162 million reduction to
the President's request for Energy Conservation. The Committee mark would
be damaging to progress in partnerships with industry on improved
industrial energy efficiency, development of more efficient autos and
trucks, and designs and materials for more efficient buildings.

        The President's budget requests $36 million for payment to the
State of California for the Retired Teachers System associated with the
sale of Elk Hills, which is not included in the Committee bill. The
Administration prefers that this payment be appropriated consistent with
the National Defense·Authorization Act.

        The Administration would like to work with the Congress to restore
funding to these important Department of Energy programs as the bill moves
through the process.

Indian Health Service

       The Administration is concerned that the Committee bill does not include


     funding increases requested for the PresidentO,s Race Initiative, alcohol
     and substance abuse initiative, and for first-year construction of the
     Fort Defiance Health Facility.  The Administration intends to work with
     the Senate to fund these important initiatives within funds available for
     the Indian Health Service.

             The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's inclusion
     of authorizing language, without hearings or tribal consultation, that
     requires contract support costs to be distributed to tribes on a pro-rata
     (proportional) basis.

     Cultural Agencies

             The Administration appreciates the Senate's support for the National
     Endowment for the Arts (NEA). We urge the Senate to provide funding for
     NEA and NEH at the President's requested level of $136 million each and
     for the Institute for Museum and Library Services at the requested level
     of $26 million.



             Likewise, the Administration appreciates the Senate's support for the
     other cultural agencies funded by this bill, including funding for the
     National Museum of the American Indian and the full request for the
     National Gallery of Art, the Holocaust Museum, and the Kennedy Center for
     the Performing Arts.  However, the Administration urges the Senate to
     provide the full $40 million request for repair and restoration in the
     Smithsonian Institution and the requested funding for digitization of the
     Smithsonian collections.
