                                         President Clinton
         A Record of Partnership With American Indians and Alaska Natives


"My administration has worked in partnership with tribal leaders . _. to protect American
Indian religious freedom, promote tribal self-determination, preserve tribal natural resources
and provide economic opportunities for Native Americans. I look forward to continuing this
government-to-government relationship in order to build on the progress we have made in
Indian Country."
                                                                  President Bill Clinton

On April 29, 1994, President Clinton became the first President to invite the leaders of all
federally recognized Tribes to the White House. On this historic occasion, the President pledged
that his Administration would work with Tribal leaders to establish a true
government-to-government partnership. The Clinton Administration has delivered on this
commitment by:

Strengthening the Relationship Between the Federal Government and Tribal Nations

   In 1994, executed a Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
    directing agencies to consult, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by
    law, with tribal governments prior to taking actions that affect federally recognized tribal
    governments.

   On May 14, 1998, issued an executive order that strengthens and makes effective across
    Administrations the 1994 Government-to-Government memorandum. This executive order
    serves to establish regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with Ipdian tribal
    governments in the development of regulatory practices on Federal matters that significantly
    or uniquely affect their communities, to reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon
    Indian tribal governments, and to streamline the application process for and increase the
    availability of waivers to Indian tribal governments.

Expanding the role ofAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives throughout his
Administration

   Appointed 59 Native Americans to all levels of his Administration, including 10 to top
    positions requiring Senate confirmation and 30 to Presidential appointment positions.

   Created the Office of Tribal Justice to promote government-to-government relations with
    Indian Tribes and ensure aggressive representation of tribal sovereignty in the courts.

                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

         quality and the environment in Indian Country.

         feathers and eagle parts to American Indians and Alaska Natives for traditional religious
         purposes.

     Promoting Tribal Self-Determination

        Supported passage and implementation of the Indian Self-Determination Act and the Tribal
         Self-Governance Act, which give Tribal governments control of most federal resources spent
         within Indian Country.

        Successfully fought attempts to penalize tribes for exercising their powers of self-governance
         and allowing states to tax Tribal governments on new trust lands.

        Proposed a 59% increase in funding for construction and facilities improvement and
         repair for Native American Schools in his FY 1999 budget.

        Provided an 10 percent increase (from $60 million to $66 million) for the Indian
         Education Act in his FY 1999 budget. Serving nearly half a million Native American
         students, the Act's programs include grants to Local Education Agencies (LEAs),
         Indian tribes and organizations, Indian-controlled schools, and individuals to address
         special educational and cultural academic needs of Native Americans.

        Signed an executive order that aims to ensure that tribal colleges and universities are
         more fully recognized as accredited institutions, have access to the opportunities
         afforded other institutions, and have Federal resources committed to them on a
         continuing basis.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

    national standards.
