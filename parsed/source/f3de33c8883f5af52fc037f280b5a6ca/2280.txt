Message Creation Date was at 16-MAY-1997 19:22:00

TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: MAY 16, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


The House Budget Committee today approved the Budget Resolution by a vote of 31
to 7, with the following Democrats voting O+noO,: McDermott (WA) , Mollohan


(WV) , Costello (IL), Mink (HI), Roybal-Allard (CA), Thompson (MS), and Weygand
(RI) .  The resolution will go to House Rules on Monday at 4:00 pm, and to the
House floor on Tuesday beginning at 2:00 pm.

While in the Committee, Smith (R-MI) offered the only Republican amendment,
which he later withdrew, regarding balancing the budget without the use of the
Social Security Trust Fund. Minge offered and also withdrew an amendment
regarding an enforcement mechanism to require the President and the Congress to
take action if the deficit is higher than in the projected budget.   It would
call for enforcement of the spending and revenue targets, not just overall
numbers.  Two Democrat amendments passed the Committee:. ShermanD,s (D-CA)
amendment regarding land acquisition, and the Roybal-Allard (D-CA) amendment
regarding domestic violence.

The Committee plans to file the resolution and the report on Saturday. The
House anticipates four additional resolutions, to be offered on the House floor
by the Coalition, the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative George
MillerD,s investment budget, and Representative Joe KennedyD,s budget.

The Senate Budget Committee will hold their markup of the Resolution on Monday,
with floor debate to follow on Tuesday.


Appropriation staff are pre-conferencing the disaster supplemental in
preparation for a Tuesday conference.  House and Senate floor action on the
Conference Report is expected by Thursday.


Republican Bill Redmond was elected the newest Member of the House of
Representatives this week. He will fill the seat of former Representative Bill
Richardson.  The swearing in ceremony will take place on Tuesday, May 20th.
