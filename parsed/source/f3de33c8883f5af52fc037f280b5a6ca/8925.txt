                             LOCATION:      Grand Hyatt Hotel, Washington, D.C.

                                            Lynn Cutler


I.    PURPOSE

      To reaffirm your commitment to protecting tribal sovereignty and the
      government-to-government relationship between the United States and tribes and to
      promote and encourage economic self-determination in Indian country.

II.   BACKGROUND

      On Thursday, April 6, you will speak to approximately 800 tribal leaders, businesses, and
      government personnel at a conference at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington, D.C.,
      sponsored by the White House (Domestic Policy Council and Office of Intergovernmental
      Affairs) and 15 federal agencies, entitled "Building Economic Self-Determination in
      Indian Communities." This event is the first time you have spoken in front of Native
      Americans since your meeting with tribal leaders in 1994.

Purpose and Structure of the Conference

      This conference grew out of your meeting with tribal leaders on April 29, 1994, and the
      establishment ofthe Domestic Policy Council's (DPC) Working Group on American
      Indians and Alaska Natives. In addition, as a result of the government-wide survey of
      activities in relation to Indian country and your suggestion that initiatives be developed
      around economic development, the DPC's subgroup on economic development started
      planning this conference several months ago.

      This conference will cover topics such as commerce in Indian country; building
      infrastructure and a positive climate for business; tribal self-government and
      economic self-determination; agriculture and economic development; rural
      business; community development in Indian country; electronic commerce; welfare
                                                                       Hex텱ump Conversion
      to work initiatives; and tourism.
Background on American Indians and Alaska Natives

      Indian America is made up of more than 550 tribes, with a total population of
      approximately 2.4 million. Approximately forty percent of all American Indians
      and Alaska Natives are under the age of twenty. Nearly half of the American
      Indian and Alaska Native population resides on 314 reservations, Indian lands, and
      in Alaska Villages that make up Indian country.

      While economic conditions in Indian country have improved in recent years,
      American Indian and Alaska Native communities continue to lag behind the rest of
      the United States with respect to social, economic, and educational attainment levels.
       Income levels of American Indians and Alaska Natives are substantially below
      those of all other Americans, and about 34 percent continue to live below the
      poverty level. In comparison, the national poverty level is about 14 percent.
      Complicating factors such as geographical isolation, under-developed
      infrastructures, and demographics add to the challenges confronting tribes as they
      work toward a better standard of living and quality of life for tribal peoples.


      In your remarks, you will be make the following announcements:

            The signing of an executive order at the conference which is designed to
             improve the academic performance of American Indian and Alaska Native
             students in grades K-12. The order focuses special attention on improving
             student achievement in reading and mathematics.

           The issuance of a directive to federal agencies to work in collaboration with
            tribal governments to: (1) prepare a report on the technology infrastructure
            needs in Indian country; (2) develop a strategic plan that will coordinate
            existing economic development initiatives across agencies; and (3) initiate a
            project to help streamline the mortgage lending process in Indian country in order
            to improve access to mortgage loans on Indian reservations. The agencies will
            initiate this mortgage lending effort through a year-long pilot program on the
            Navajo Nation and in at least one other location.

           The intention of the Department of Agriculture (USDA), through its Bringing
            Rural America Venture Opportunities (BRAVO) initiative, to direct $70 million
            of its contracting dollars through Fiscal Year 2000 to assist seven American
            Indian and Alaska Native tribes establish small start-up technology companies in
            order to obtain government contracts.

           A call to Congress to pass legislation to elevate the Director of the Indian Health
            Service to an Assistant Secretary. Elevating the illS Director to the position of
            Assistant Secretary will strengthen the govemment-to-government relationship;
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

              facilitate communication and consultation with the Tribes on matters of Indian
              health; and raise awareness of Indian health concerns throughout HHS and the
              entire federal government.

             A change in the state-by-state allocation of the $24 billion in the Children's
              Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to appropriately count Native American
              children. States receive a share of CHIP funds based on their proportion of
              uninsured children below 200 percent of poverty. When the Census Bureau
              produced these counts last September, it did not include Native American children
              with access to the Indian Health Service as "uninsured." Thus, even though such
              children are eligible for CHIP coverage, the states with a large number of Native
              American children did not receive a larger share of funds. These revised
              allotments will be published in October with the preliminary 1999 allotments.
