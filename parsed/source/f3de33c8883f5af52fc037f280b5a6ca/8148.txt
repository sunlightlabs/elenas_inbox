MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  GENE SPERLING
                       BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:               Individual Development Accounts


       Next Wednesday, the Senate Labor committee will mark-up the Human Services
reauthorization bill. Besides Head Start and LIHEAP reauthorization, the Committee is planning to
include a demonstration of Individual Development Accounts. Given your record, we believe that
you should get out in front on this issue and we should either endorse the proposal (with some
modifications) or propose our own IDA demonstration.

         For many years, you have strongly supported Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) as a
means to build assets among lower-income Americans, help move people from welfare to work,
expand homeownership opportunity, increase access to post-secondary education, and help people
start their own businesses. Indeed, nearly six years ago -- in September 1992 -- you announced
your support for IDAs, saying that they "would encourage poor Americans to set money aside in
special savings accounts that they can use for a home, their education, their training or starting a
small business." To that end, your 1994 Welfare Reform proposal included an IDA proposal and
the 1996 Welfare Reform law allowed States to use welfare funds to establish IDAs.

        However, the Federal government has yet to provide direct funding to create IDAs. This
memo lays out three potential options for the Administration: (1) endorse the Coats-Harkin IDA
demonstration bill; (2) put forward our own Coats-Harkin-like IDA proposal with a higher price tag;
or (3) propose a narrower IDA demonstration for just homeownership.                             .

Coats-Harkin IDA Demonstration Bill:

     . Senator Coats and Senator Harkin are the lead sponsors of a bill which would establish a
                                                        .
four-year, $100 million IDA demonstration program under which State and local agencies and/or
non-profits would be funded to operate IDA programs providing a match of not less than 1: 1 and not
more than 8: 1 for each dollar of eamed income deposited in the account. Withdrawals would be
permitted for only three purposes: (l) purchase of a first home, (2) post-secondary educational
expenses, or (3) starting a new business. Under the Coats-Harkin bill, preference in the application
process would be given to entities that are able to attract pledges of substantial non-Federal,
especially private sector, funding to serve as a match for the Federal dollars. Participation would be
open to households that are either eligible for welfare (T ANF) or have an income level below the
EITC phase-out point and a net worth below $10,000. In order to determine whether this IDA
demonstration works, the Coats-Harkin bill would require that there be a rigorous evaluation of the
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
program.
        You should know that the Coats-Harkin bill has the support of a bipartisan group of
Senators, including Abraham, Lugar, Collins, Moseley-Braun and Wellstone. On the House side,
the lead sponsors of the companion bill are Tony Hall and Kasich. While there are no real
substantive problems with the bill, there need to be some clarifications and technical corrections.

Options:

        The following options would be coupled with two other measures to promote IDAs in the
private sector and at the state and local level: first, we would ask the banking regulators to clarify that
banks and thrifts can receive Community Reinvestment Act credit for IDA programs; and second, a
letter would be sent from HUD clarifying that HOME and CDBG funds can be used to
establish IDA programs. In addition, because of the need for an offset to pay for any of the
following options, we are investigating whether we could place the IDA program within the Treasury
Department instead of at HHS (as the Coats-Harkin bill does) and direct the Community
Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) fund to set-aside funds from its existing budget request
for FY99 to pay for its operations.

Option 1: Endorse Coats-Harkin bill

Pros:

       Could help approximately 50,000 lower-income Americans build assets, which is an
        important means to get out of the cycle of dependency.

       While the national homeownership rate is nearly 66 percent, the rate among lower-income
        and disadvantaged Americans is below 50 percent. IDAs would help expand
        homeownership opportunities to this group of people. IDAs would also help increase
        access to college and help low-income families start their own businesses.

       Provides another tool to move people from welfare to work.

       Enactment of Federal IDA legislation would complete the community empowerment agenda
        you laid out in your 1992 campaign.

       Would dovetail well with other housing proposals: Low-Income Housing Tax Credit
        expansion will help develop more rental housing units; Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers
        will help move welfare recipients into privately owned rental housing; and IDAs will help
        these families save to become homeowners.                                   .

       Of all the options being considered, must likely to be enacted this year.

Cons:

       The Coats-Harkin bill comes with a price tag of$25 million per year. One option to pay for
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


            our endorsement could be to place its operation within the CDFI Fund and direct the Fund to
            set-aside $25 million within its FY99 budget request.

           Endorsing Coats-Harkin means you will have to share credit for enacting IDAs.

           This initiative would help only a small percentage oflow-income persons who need help
            accumulating wealth.

           An IDA demonstration may be vulnerable to fraud, especially allowing withdrawals for small
            business activities.

           Some believe that Republicans would expand IDA bill to include K-12 private school
            education, reopening the same issues raised by Coverdell amendment, but in a less favorable
            context (IDAs help lower-income Americans, while IRAs disproportionately benefit those
            with higher incomes).


    Option 2: Put Forward Our Own IDA Demonstration with a Higher Price Tag

             Another option would be to put forward our own IDA demonstration proposal (with a higher
    price tag), while acknowledging the proposal from Senators Coats and Harkin. OMB believes that
    the largest our own IDA demonstration program could be -- within your FY99 budget -- is $30
    million per year (or $150 million over five years). This option would allow us to make the small
    substantive and technical changes to the Coats-Harkin proposal without having to negotiate with
    their staffs.

    Pros:

           Same as option 1, but you would have ownership of the proposal.

    Cons:

           Same as option I, but the price tag for this option would be higher and would require a
            larger offset.

           Could upset Harkin and Coats that we are proposing a similar IDA demonstration without
            endorsing their proposal.


    Option 3: Propose More Narrow IDA Demonstration for Only Homeownership

            Another alternative would be to propose a narrow IDA demonstration which would be
    focused solely on homeownership -- the only qualified withdrawal would be for the purchase of a
    first home.



                                                      3
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
Pros:

       Focusesmessage on homeownership and focus attention on the importance of saving for
        homeownership.

       Allays concerns of education community that IDAs would be used as vehicle for Coverdell.

       Costs less than other two options.

Cons:

        Some may question why we did not propose allowing post-secondary education as a qualified
        withdrawal from IDAs, given your strong record on expanding access to college. We would
        get the same criticism for not allowing withdrawals for starting a new small business.

Recommendations:

      OMB, White House Legislative Affairs, Treasury, Labor, HUD, DPC, CEA, SBA, and HHS
recommend that you support the Coats-Harkin bill with some modifications.

        Education does not support an IDA demonstration that allows withdrawals for
post-secondary education because they are very concerned that the Republicans would try to open
up IDAs to K-12 private school education. Senator Harkin has.indicated that he will drop support
for the IDA demonstration if the Republicans try to propose a Coverdell-like amendment. You
should know that if you decide to support Coats-Harkin, we will try to obtain a similar pledge from
Senator Coats. We believe that this strategy would be successful because, with Coats leaving the
Senate this year, he is more interested in passing the IDA bill than in scoring political points.


               Endorse Coats-Harkin Bill (RECOMMENDED)

               Put Forward Your Own, Bigger IDA Demonstration Proposal

               Propose Narrow IDA Demonstration Program Targeted To Homeownership
