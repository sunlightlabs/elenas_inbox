                       THE WHITE HOUSE AT WORK:
    THE BEST EDUCATION, STRONGER FAMILIES, AND A MORE SECURE WORLD
                           Thursday, April 3, 1997

    WEDNESDAY: CALIFORNIA ENDORSES NATIONAL EDUCATION STANDARDS

     Yesterday, California joined with Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina and
America's military schools in support of President Clinton's plan for national education standards.

        With the endorsement of California Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin,
         states and school systems that educate nearly 20 of America's school children are now on
         the road to measuring their students against high national standards.

        240 of America's high-tech industry leaders endorsed the President's plan as well -- and
         pledged to write to every governor, every state school board and every state education
         leader to urge the adoption of national standards across America.

        In the two months since the President challenged every state to adopt high national
         standards, testing every 4th grader in reading and every 8th grader in math, support has
         come from Republicans and Democrats, teachers and business people, parents and
         educators -- because we all have a stake in giving our children the best education.

        TUESDAY: PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM HARMFUL INFLUENCES BY
                    TAKING ACTION TO CURB LIQUOR ADS

       In response to the liquor industry'S reversal of their 50-year voluntary ban on TV
ads, the President urges responsibility and takes action:

        The President urges the liquor industry to rethink its decision and keep the ban, for the
         sake of America's parents and young people.

        The President asks the FCC to explore the effects on children of the hard liquor industry'S
         decision to advertise on television, and determine the appropriate action in response.

           TOMORROW: WORKING TO ELIMINATE CHEMICAL WEAPONS

        This Friday, the President will join with bipartisan leaders to urge Senate
ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention by the April 29 deadline:

        It will require other countries to do what we are already doing -- eliminate chemical
         weapons.

        Ratifying the Convention will protect our troops in the field, make it harder for terrorists
         to obtain chemical weapons, and help punish rogue states that use them.
