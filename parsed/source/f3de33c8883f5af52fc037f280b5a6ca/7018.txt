SUBJECT:               California Proposition 227 (Unz Initiative) to End Bilingual Education


         On June 2, California voters will consider Proposition 227, otherwise known as the Unz
Initiative, which proposes to eliminate virtually all bilingual education. This is California's third
potentially divisive race-related initiative in four years, following on the heels of Proposition
187, which barred public benefits for illegal immigrants, and Proposition 209, which ended
affinnative action.

          Polls show that the initiative is popular and is likely to pass, although a strong
opposition campaign could make this election close. Many Latino voters currently favor the
initiative, although the polls show that Latino support has declined considerably as voters
become more familiar with the details of the proposal. Latino activists are strongly opposed to
Unz, and are looking to the White House to support their efforts to defeat it.

       Over the past several months DPC and Education Department staff worked with Maria
Echaveste, Mickey Ibarra, Karen Skelton, and Janet Murguia to study the Unz Initiative,
including extensive outreach to both opponents and supporters in California, in the Congress and
among the advocacy community. Despite legitimate concerns over the effectiveness of some
bilingual education programs, your advisors strongly believe that the Unz initiative is bad
education policy and will harm students who need help the most.

        We recommend that you publicly oppose the Unz Initiative because it deprives local
educators of the ability to make educationally sound choices about how to meet the needs of
limited English proficient children they serve and almost certainly will result in widespread
violations of federal civil rights law. Your opposition to Unz should be coupled with a
statement ofthe principles you support for strengthening programs to help Limited English
Proficient students become proficient in English.


I.      The Unz Initiative and Bilingual Education in California

A. Overview ofthe Unz Initiative

        This initiative, authored and backed by Silicon Valley millionaire Ron Unz, is designed to


                                                  I
                                                                         Hex-Dilmp Conversion
end all bilingual education programs in California. More specifically, it would:

      Require that all public school instruction be conducted in English.
      Permit this requirement to be waived only if parents or guardians can show that the child
       already knows English, has special needs, or would learn English faster through an
       altemative instructional technique.
      Provide initial placement for Limited English Proficient (LEP) students in "sheltered
       English immersion" programs for a period normally not to exceed one year. Instruction
       in these programs would be conducted in English, with some accommodations in the
       curriculum to take into account the limited English language skills of the students.
      Appropriate $50 million per year over 10 years to fund adult education programs
       designed to teach English to LEP adults who in tum pledge to provide English language
       tutoring to LEP students.
      Make teachers, administrators and school board members subject to suits and personally
       liable for failure to implement the provisions of the initiative.

        Unz and other backers of this initiative regard the existing system of bilingual education
in the state as a complete failure. They argue that because bilingual education relies so heavily
on use of the students' native language and only slowly introduces English, the approach delays
or prevents, rather than promotes, the acquisition of English. Further, they point out that
although California's bilingual education law expired a decade ago, the legislature has been
unable to enact legislation to reform a broken program. This initiative, they argue, will break
the legislative impasse and dramatically change bilingual education policy for the better.

B. Bilingual Education in California

       Demographics. There are approximately 1.3 million Limited English Proficient (LEP)
students in California, approximately one quarter of California's K-12 students. This number
has nearly doubled in less than a decade, and represents some 43% of the national total. Seventy
nine percent of California's LEP students are native Spanish speakers. Hispanics have a 50%
dropout rate, and by most indicators their academic performance lags behind most other
population groups in the state.

        Educational Services. LEP students receive a wide variety of services intended to help
them learn English and academic subjects. In 1997, only about 30% received what is
conventionally considered bilingual education -- programs which make significant use of the
student's primary language to teach academics while phasing in ever greater amounts of English
language instruction. More than half participate in specially designed instructional programs
that help students learn English through a combination of approaches such as direct instruction in
grammar, vocabulary and communications, while teaching other subjects in a way designed to be
accessible to LEP students. (The Unz Initiative would eliminate these programs as well as
conventional bilingual programs.) Approximately 16% of all LEP students are not receiving any
language instruction services at all.

                                                 2
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
        California Legal Framework. The legal framework for providing services to LEP
students in California is murky. California's Bilingual Education Act sunseted in 1987, but the
State Board of Education regulations implementing the act have remained in effect. Under this
framework, school districts are required to help students become fluent in English and competent
in other academic subjects, and are given a significant amount of flexibility in determining how
to achieve these goals. Neither bilingual education nor any other specific approach to teaching
LEP students is required.

         There have been a number of unsuccessful attempts in the past decade to enact new
legislation, but bilingual education refonners and advocates have been unable to agree on an
approach. There has been a fresh attempt over the past month to craft compromise legislation,
partly to take the steam out ofUnz and to give Unz opponents something to support. This
effort, however, is likely to end in failure.

         Early in March the State Board of Education took the first step toward eliminating the
state bilingual education regulations. This process should be completed shortly before the vote
on Unz. The effect ofthis action will be to eliminate any state requirement for the provision of
specific services to LEP students, and to give local school districts even greater flexibility in this
area.

II.     Political Context

         The Unz initiative is currently the most serious threat to bilingual education, but it is not
likely to be the last. Earlier this year Speaker Gingrich proposed eliminating bilingual
education, and some conservative education experts (SC:.&, Diane Ravitch) have also called for its
elimination. Last week, Rep. DeLay introduced a bill that would eliminate the federal bilingual
education program, and House Republicans have included a $75 million recision ofFY98
funding for bilingual education in the emergency supplemental bill. Especially ifUnz passes,
we are likely to see energized opposition to the federal program, and increased opposition in
other states and localities.

         The Unz initiative presents a political dilemma in California. Ifwe oppose it, we
risk alienating a majority of California Anglo voters. If we fail to oppose it, we risk alienating a
vocal and increasingly influential group of Latino leaders, and possibly Latino voters.

         Current polls show that a large majority of California Anglo voters support Unz. For
Anglos, bilingual education may become a hot button issue similar to immigrant services and
affirmative action. In contrast, Latino voters are split on the issue. While many continue to
support Unz largely out of frustration at the public schools' failure to help their children, polls
show that Latino support is eroding as they become more aware of the particulars of the
initiative. And the polls tended to underestimate Latino opposition to Prop. 187 and Prop. 209.

        Latino activists and elected officials oppose Unz. To some of the Latino leaders, Unz is


                                                  3
                                                                Hex텱ilmp Conversion

a litmus issue, like Propositions 187 and 209. Latino leaders are looking to the White House to
become actively involved in the opposition to Unz, and an: fearful that we will choose to sit on
the sidelines.

         More organizations and elected officials are taking positions on Unz. The California
education community -- including the California Teachers Association and the California
School Boards Association -- is strongly opposed to Unz. Key Democratic officeholders
(including Sen. Boxer, Rep. Becerra and most Democrats in the California delegation, State
Superintendent Delaine Eastin, and Speaker Villaraigosa) have also announced their opposition
to the Unz initiative. All three Democratic gubernatorial candidates have come out against Unz.
  Sen. Feinstein has not taken a public stance yet, though she appears likely to support Unz. A
list of organizations, elected officials, and other leaders that have taken positions on Unz is
attached.

        The Republican state party has supported Unz, though many Republican officials,
including Gov. Wilson, have not yet taken a position. Dan Lungren has not taken a position yet,
but has recently said that the recent action by the State Board of Education has eliminated the
need for Unz. There is always a chance that White House opposition to Unz could polarize the
situation and push Gov. Wilson and other Republicans to support Unz, but at least some
Republican leaders are afraid to support another initiative viewed as anti-Hispanic.

       The political dilemma can be resolved with a "Mend it / Don't End it" response.
We believe the best approach to this issue is to strike a middle ground by admitting that bilingual
education needs mending, but asserting that Unz is not the way to do it. More specifically, we
can:
      Start by reiterating the overriding importance of helping every child become proficient in
       English;
      Oppose Unz on the merits because it is too extreme;
      Remind voters what we are for, including both our overall approach to strengthening
       public education and our Hispanic initiative;
      Articulate the fundamental principles that you believe should be used by local
       communities to strengthen their efforts to educate LEP students. These principles include
       helping children become proficient in English as quickly as possible, holding schools
       accountable for results, providing local flexibility, and emphasizing quality in any
       approach used.


III.   Specific Recommendations

I. Oppose Unz Initiative on educational and legal grounds.

       Educational. While evaluations of bilingual education in California and
elsewhere have identified some promising efforts, few believe that the services now


                                                4
                                                                Hex-Dump ConversIOn

provided to LEP students are effective on a large scale basis. In many cases,
shortages of qualified teachers and poor implementation have limited the effectiveness
of existing programs. However, these bilingual education programs should be
"mended, not ended." A one-size-fits-all State prescription for how to educate limited
English proficient children and demanding that it be done within one year will, in our
view, be counter-productive to achieving the goal of helping LEP students learn
English, reach high standards, and participate effectively in classrooms where English
is the language of instruction. Experience and research, including a 1997 report of the
National Academy of Sciences, indicate that no one approach is the answer for all
limited English proficient children.

         Rather -- whether the approach is bilingual education, English as a second
language, structured immersion, or some variation or hybrid of them -- the success of
programs turns on the quality and commitment of the school and teacher. The Unz
Initiative is likely to impair chances for success by limiting the discretion of schools and
teachers to determine what works best for their LEP students. In fact, the Unz Initiative
is an extreme form of overregulation that prevents teachers and parents from exercising
common sense and professional judgment of how to serve individual children.
Exceptions can be made only by bureaucrats far removed from the classroom, and
personal liability of teachers increases the prospect of court intrusions in J~ducational
matters to new and alarming levels.

        A National Academy of Sciences study released March 18 shows that LEP
children with no English proficiency are best taught to read English by first being taught
reading in their native language, if teachers and instructional materials in their native
language are available. Thus, while a structured English immersion approach may be
effective for some limited English proficient children, it is likely to be ineffective for
many others. In addition, our experience in administering the Bilingual Education Act
and in reviewing programs for possible violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
indicates that one year of special instruction -- whether in Bilingual Education or an
English immersion approach -- rarely is sufficient to enable a child who starts the
program with almost no proficiency in English to become proficient enough to
participate in regular classes.

        Legal. Based on the educational problems described above, the Unz Initiative
implicates federal civil rights laws. In the seminal 1974 case of Lauv. Nichols, the
Supreme Court interpreted Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to require school districts to
take steps to ensure that national origin minority students with limited English
proficiency can effectively participate in the regular educational program. Similarly, the
Equal Educational Opportunity Act, enacted in 1974, requires public educational
agencies to take appropriate action to
overcome language barriers that impede student participation in the instructional
programs. Neither Lau nor the subsequent cases addressing Title VI or the Equal
Educational Opportunity Act mandate a particular approach to meeting these needs,
but they require that sound educational approaches be implemented and evaluated.

                                             5
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

        Assuming that some educational experts will vouch for the soundness of the
sheltered English immersion approach mandated by the Unz Initiative, we do not
believe that a legal challenge asserting that the Unz Initiative on its face violates Title VI
or the Equal Educational Opportunity Act would succeed. However, the Unz Initiative
is certain to cause widespread violations of Title VI and the Equal Educational
Opportunity Act if it is interpreted and applied in accordance with its intent to eliminate
the choices of local educators when providing the appropriate instruction for limited
English proficient students. Realistically, the only way that widespread violations will
be avoided is if the State or local educational agencies broadly use loopholes in the
Proposition to extend services well beyond a year and to provide bilingual education for
students who need it.

       It is evident that the Unz Initiative inevitably will create legal confrontations
between California agencies and this Department, as well as the Department of Justice,
over violations of civil rights laws and will divert resources and attention that should be
focused on educating children to investigations and litigation.

         Recommendation: For these reasons, we recommend that the Administration publicly
oppose the Unz Initiative. Taking a position soon will allow us to help frame the debate and set
a constructive tone, rather than get drawn into an already inflamatory debate. An immediate
announcement will also allay concerns in the advocacy community that we may sit this battle out
until it is too late to have an impact on the outcome. Neither you nor the Vice President are
scheduled to be in California in the immediate future. Therefore, we believe that Secretary
Riley should make the initial announcement of the Administration's position in California within
the next week to ten days.

        We also believe that you should use your visit to California in early May to personally
make the case against the Unz Initiative. We will also work with the Vice President's office to
create an appropriate opportunity for him to express his opposition to Unz.

2. Couple opposition to Unz with a clear statement of how local school districts can
strengthen education for LEP students.

         In accord with our recommendation for a "mend, don't end" approach to bilingual
 education, we believe that opposition to Unz should be coupled with a strong statement
,recognizing the importance of helping LEP students learn English and succeed, and a set of
 principles that should guide local efforts to strengthen rather than end these programs. The
 intent here is to underscore that while there is a place for bilingual education (and other ways to
 help LEP students become proficient in English), bilingual education programs in particular and

                                                 6
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
the schools that serve LEP students must do a better job.
        We seriously considered but rejected the idea of underscoring your commitment to
improve bilingual education by also proposing statutory changes to the federal Bilingual
Education Program. After consultation with members of the California Congressional
delegation, the Hispanic Caucus and others, we concluded that this step would be premature
since Congress is unlikely to pass or even consider your proposals until next year, when the
bilingual education is scheduled for reauthorization. An Administration proposal now would
fuel other Congressional proposals to dramatically alter or eliminate bilingual education.
Further, proposing changes to the federal program now would also place members of the
California Congressional delegation in a difficult position, because they would be forced to take
a position on both the Unz Initiative and your legislative proposal.

        The approach to improving bilingual education proposed below will be further developed
into specific legislative proposals in the coming months, as the Education Department prepares
for the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Specifically, we
recommend the following principles:

        Set a goal for school districts to help LEP students learn English within 3 years.
All sides of this debate--including particularly parents of Hispanic and other LEP students--want
children to learn English as rapidly as possible. However, bilingual education programs are
often portrayed as prolonging rather than speeding the process oflearning English, and are often
perceived to be open-ended rather than transitional programs. The best available evidence
suggests that it currently takes LEP students 4-5 years to become proficient in English.
Currently, few school districts establish clear time lines or goals for LEP students to learn
English.

         Challenging school districts to set and meet a clear goal of helping LEP students become
proficient in English within 3 years will clearly ensure that your opposition to Unz in not seen as
an endorsement of the status quo. Setting a clear goal is the first step in reducing the length of
time it takes for students to master English. It will send a clear message to teachers and
administrators to adopt curriculum and instructional strategies that are designed to help students
acquire English proficiency as rapidly as possible. In this context, you should also urge school
districts to set the same academic standards and expectations for LEP students as all other
students are expected to meet; notify parents of every LEP student of these goals when the
student is first enrolled; assess student progress in English and toward meeting standards in other
academic subjects annually; identify early and provide extra help to students who are not making
progress.

        This proposal will be very unpopular with the Hispanic Caucus and the bilingual
advocacy community. They will argue that there is no clear research base to establish a 3-year
time frame, that individuals vary in how long they need to master English, and that pushing
students to learn English early will slow down their ability to master other academic subjects.
They will also argue that advocating a 3-year time frame--or any other arbitrary time limit--plays

into the hands ofUnz and his supporters and weakens the ability ofUnz opponents to make the
case against the I-year arbitrary time limit in his proposal. Further, they and many educators
will argue that if it is necessary to set time lines for learning English, local educators and
communities ought to take responsibility for determining the appropriate length of time.

        We believe that these concerns can be reduced somewhat by making clear that you are
calling for a goal rather than a strict time limit, by emphasizing accountability for meeting the
goal rests primarily on local schools, and by not proposing to end language services to students
who have not yet mastered English within 3 years.

         Local school districts must be accountable for performance and results. School
districts must be held accountable for helping students become proficient in English as rapidly as
possible. They should report publicly how well they are meeting the timelines they have
established. They should test students periodically for English proficiency (as well as
achievement in other subjects) to determine if they are making adequate progress, and to provide
additional services or take other corrective actions as appropriate when students are not making
adequate progress. School districts should evaluate their bilingual education programs regularly
as well. If a program is not helping its students progress rapidly enough, the school district
should strengthen it, or use another approach research shows will work.

       There must be local flexibility.   As discussed above, no one-size-fits-all
prescription for how to educate limited English proficient children will work. Local
schools must have the flexibility to design programs that meet its particular needs, mix
of students and resources. So long as the goal is clear--that students learn English as
rapidly as possible--and there is accountability for results, parents and educators should
be free to work together to fashion programs that work for them.

        The focus must be on strengthening quality, regardless of approach. The research
on instruction for LEP students does not identify any approach (~ bilingual education, English
immersion, English as a Second Language, or dual-language immersion) as mbre effective than
others. Rather, it suggests that effective programs have well-prepared teachers who know how
to teach reading and who are knowledgeable about second-language acquisition; provide students
with a challenging curriculum and high academic standards; and regularly assess student progress
and make adjustments in the instructional program accordingly. In short, ifLEP students are to
learn English and succeed in school, they must be in schools that work for all students--schools
with high standards, good teachers, smaller classes, challenging curriculum and accountability
for results. Because of this, any discussion of the steps required to strengthen local quality
provides an opportunity to discuss your overall agenda for strengthening public schools
