Title I's $118 Billion Fails to Close Gap
<Picture>Program has been unable to lift academic level of poor students,
research shows.

<Picture: T>he federal government's largest education grant program,
despite
spending $118 billion over the last three. decades, has been unable to meet
its
goal of narrowing the achievement gap between rich and poor students,
interviews and documents show.
     Title I, which started with idealistic fervor in the 1960s' War on
Poverty, provides $7.4 billion each year to help one of every five pupils
in
the nation's public schools.
     Recent evaluations by the u.S. Department of Education found that the
extra computers, tutoring and more than 132,000 classroom positions paid
for
by the massive investment have been "insufficient to close the gap" in
reading
and math performance between poor students and their more affluent peers.
     The program has been "a failure up to now," said Maris A. Vinovskis, a
University of Michigan education expert who has reviewed independent
studies
assessing the effectiveness of Title I. "The real losers in this are not
just
the taxpayers [but] the kids . . . . We haven't been able to deliver."
     One reason, experts agree, is that Title I funds are spread too thin
among the nation's poor students to do much good. And, of the billions of
dollars allocated each year, most are spent on tutoring and other remedial
efforts that have produced marginal improvement in test scores.
     Much of the blame for the program's shortcomings has been directed at


 the
 more than 50,000 school aides and teacher assistants hired with Title I
 funds.
 A nationwide movement to replace these "paraprofessionals" with certified
 teachers has sparked controversy and led to considerable anxiety.
      Under increasing pressure to show results, the program now finds
 itself
 on a collision course with its past--and the aides are caught in the
 middle,
 experts say.
       "It's a classic situation where yesterday's reform becomes today's
 obstacle," said Jerome T. Murphy, dean of Harvard University's Graduate
 School
 of Education, who helped write Title I legislation 34 years ago.
      Title I, which comes before Congress for reauthorization this year,
 was
 created to tackle perhaps the most daunting task in all of education: to
 help
 students overcome the inherent barriers that poverty poses to academic
 achievement.
      While no one expects the federal government to eliminate such a
 formidable deficit, supporters contend that Title I has become a victim of
 unrealistic expectations. They credit the program with focusing attention
 on
 the needs of low-income students, but they also argue that Title I is no
 match
 for the challenges presented by poverty and problems such as racial
 tensions,
 language barriers, crime, violence and drug use.
       Title I "can change some services, but it cannot change the lives of
 hundreds of thousands of kids," said Jack Jennings, director of the Center
 on
 Education Policy in Washington and a former general counsel of the House
 Labor
 and Education Committee.
       A special evaluation report last fall by the Department of Education
 found that the gap between 9-year-olds attending "high-poverty" and "low-
 poverty" schools either stayed the same or increased from the mid-1980s to
 the
 mid-1990s. This gap left poor students nearly four grade levels behind
 affluent pupils in reading and two levels behind in math.
       In addition, a separate study commissioned specifically to assess
 Title I
 concluded in 1997 that the massive spending has had little effect on the
 achievement gap.
       The 1997 Education Department report found that Title I failed to
 make a
 significant dent in the achievement gap from 1991 to 1994 in part because
 it
 tolerates low academic standards for poor and minority students.
       Many Title I programs "reinforced low expectations for student
 achievement," the report says. "Students in high-poverty schools were
 exposed
 to a 'watered-down' and non-challenging curriculum when compared to other
 students."

      Squandering of Funds on Clerks, Aides Cited
      Also part of the problem, according to high-ranking education
 officials
 and other experts, is that schools squander Title I funds on clerical


workers
and classroom aides who lack the expertise to teach poor students the kind
of
high-level skills needed to compete with their more affluent peers.
      Reformers have seized on these findings and urged the removal of
classroom aides to pay for retraining teachers or to hire new ones. The
push
even comes from the top of the Clinton administration's Education
Department.
      "It's pretty significant that half of the instructional staff under
Title
I were" paraprofessionals," said Val Plisko, who supervises independent
evaluations for the Education Department's Planning and Evaluation Service.
"For children who are most at risk, you want the best-educated, the most
knowledgeable, the most effective teachers."
      Mary Jean LeTendre, a top federal education official who oversees
Title I
and other programs for disadvantaged students, said that in some cases
employment of Title I aides has amounted to "a jobs program for members of
the
community." She added, "I am one who believes that this program needs to be
focused on the needs of the kids."
      LeTendre vowed in a recent interview to "work with every ounce of my
energy" to shift Title I spending from aides to more qualified teachers.
She
added that federal officials are considering whether to eventually limit or
prohibit the use of Title I funds to hire teacher aides.

      Unfavorable Ratios of Aides to Teachers
      In California, the latest available figures indicate that the ratio of
aides to teachers paid for by Title I funds is 4 to 1. At Los Angeles
Unified,
the nation's second-largest school district, the ratio is about 7 to 1. And
most of the instructors on the district's Title I payroll rarely teach;
instead they serve as program coordinators at their individual schools,
officials said.
      The winds of change already are being felt at LAUSD, where all but
two of
30 schools facing a takeover by the superintendent's office for dismal
student
performance are considered Title I schools. In all, 465 of 641 LAUSD
schools
have student populations that are predominantly poor.
      Supt. Ruben Zacarias recently ordered the spending of $10 million in
Title I funds for extra tutoring at the district's lowest-performing
schools.
In an interview, zacarias added that he may dip further into those federal
funds to pay for other student intervention programs as well as teacher
training--moves that he said might spell "crunch time" for teacher aides.
      "If the priorities mean that we're going to have to reduce our
aides, then we're going to have to bite that bullet," he said.
      At Pacoima Elementary, one of the 30 schools on Zacarias' list for
academic probation, Principal Lawrence D. Gonzales is already tasting the
gunpowder.
      In a bid to kick-start student scores languishing in the bottom 25% of
the LAUSD, Gonzales is investing $100,000 of the school's $800,000 Title I
allotment into an intensive reading program for each of Pacoima's 70
classrooms. Some of the money comes from reductions in Title I classroom
aides
through attrition, said Gonzales.


      "We have to put up or shut up," he said.
      But the retrenchment has been slow and difficult. Not only are LAUSD
aides unionized, they are among the most visible and popular features of a
Title I program that has become deeply embedded in some neighborhoods as a
source of steady employment that increased the presence of adults in
schools.
      The Title I aides, who work for significantly lower wages than
teachers,
are widely used in classrooms to work one-on-one or with small groups of
students to reinforce lessons. They also se1920361760nonnative students.
      Mary Castro has been on the Title I payroll as an aide for 22 years,
the
last 11 at James A. Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. The
soft-spoken
great-grandmother works seven hours a day shelving books, shushing
students in
the library and preparing due-date notices.
      Castro is one of 6,540 part-time paraprofessionals whose employment
consumes nearly 40% of LAUSD's Title I budget this year. By comparison,
21% of
the district's Title I funds are spent on instructors and teacher training.
The remaining expenditures include instructional materials and support
staff,
such as school psychologists.
      As part of its $l.l-million annual allotment in Title I funds,
Garfield
employs 22 aides--all but five work in classrooms, budget figures show.
      Since her job isn't directly related to classroom instruction, Castro
may
be a prime candidate for dismissal. At 62, Castro is not volunteering to
quit
her $10.84-an-hour position.
      "It's not easy to say I'd get another job, because I'm old," she said.
      Nor is anyone likely to force her out at Garfield, which is facing
administrative takeover due to dismal academic performance. Alex Fuentes,
Garfield's Title I coordinator, said that downsizing would put him in a
bind,
even in cases of non-classroom aides like Castro.
      "She's providing services--maybe not the services when she was young,
but
I'm not getting any complaints," said Fuentes. "What do you say to someone
like that? 'Oh, Mary, it's time for you to go out to pasture'?"

     Question at Heart of Rehabilitation Effort
     Indeed, that question--with all its personal and policy
implications--is
at the heart of the latest push to rehabilitate Title I.
     Considered the keystone of the War on Poverty, Title I was fashioned
during the country's civil rights struggle by President Lyndon B. Johnson,
who
muscled it through Congress in a breathtaking 89 days as part of a sweeping
school aid bill.
     "I will never do anything in my entire life, now or in the future,
that
excites me more or benefits the nation I serve more," said Johnson, a
former
teacher, after he signed Title I into law in 1965 in front of a one-room
schoolhouse in Texas.
     The program was predicated on an academic truism: Family income is
closely linked to educational success.


     Johnson hoped to make up for the disadvantages of poverty by
providing a
jolt of federal dollars earmarked for extra tutoring and other add-on
programs
targeted at low-income students.
      In a symbolic gesture, Johnson set the initial Title I appropri·ation
at
$1 billion. The program has since grown to seven times that size.
     Title I currently pays an average of $685 per poor child as defined by
the u.s. Census, but its spending formula has been so politicized that the
actual amounts vary widely among states. California, home of the largest
concentration of impoverished students, receives only $573 per pupil--an
amount that is less than the funding provided to 49 other states and
territories.
     The money flows from washington to 46,000--or nearly half--of the
nation's schools. It is intended for students who are considered
educationally
"at risk." In California, such students are identified as children from
welfare families or children who qualify for free or reduced-priced I
unches.
     The ultimate decision on how to spend the money, however, remains with
each school. Across the country, school administrators have invested Title
I
dollars in "pull-out" programs, in which low-income students are taken out
of
their regular classes for 3D-minute tutoring sessions each day that
incorporate new materials and computers.
     And they've hired more than 50,000 school and classroom aides.
Typically,
the aides were parents or activists from surrounding neighborhoods. They
monitored lunchrooms, ran off dittos on the mimeograph, put up bulletin
boards.
     Teacher aides have had the biggest effect in the classroom, working
individually with poor students to reinforce lessons. This is particularly
true in elementary schools, where the aides have become fixtures.
     As a condition· of employment, more than 5,000 classroom "teaching
aides"
in Los Angeles are required to enroll in college courses or degree
programs to
become certified educators, said Margaret A. Jones, LAUSD director of
specially funded programs.
      "I've seen some teaching assistants who are better than some of the
teachers we have," Jones said, scoffing at the movement by critics to
replace
aides.
     An additional 1,500 resource aides are not required to enroll in colI
ege
courses, but some are still used in classrooms and contend they do a good
job.
     Sharon Watanabe has outlasted three principals and all but a few
teachers
as a $12.26-an-hour Title I aide for the last 19 years at Hoover Street
Elementary School, near downtown Los Angeles.
      "I think I make a big difference in the classroom with the children
because I've seen it," said Watanabe, who works three hours each morning.
"In
the beginning of the year, some [students] wouldn't speak in English. Now
they
come up to me and make a conversation with me."
     Few have challenged such claims, especially during the 1970s and early


1980s, when test scores among minority students--who receive the bulk of
Title
I services--began catching up, narrowing the achievement gap by about a
third.
But in the mid-1980s, scores for minority students stalled and the gap
widened. Critics, particularly political conservatives, have heaped blame
on
Title I ever since.
      "It's a waste," Chester E. Finn Jr., former assistant secretary of
Education under President Reagan, said in a recent interview. "It's
accomplishing nothing other than the expenditure of money."
      Finn noted that the program remains popular in Washington because
Title I
funds go to most congressional districts. "The fiercest fights in Congress
are
not over whether it accomplishes anything but over the distribution formula
for the money."

     Complaints by Black Parents Are Described
     Even longtime advocates such as Phyllis McClure, a former NAACP Legal
Defense and Education Fund monitor who kept a watchful eye on Title I
compliance, now raise questions about the efficacy of the program. McClure
recalled hearing complaints from black parents that the program was
relegating
their children to a second-class education.
     "When black parents were taking their kids out of Title I because

they weren't getting the regular math, they were getting something
low-level .
. . I changed my mind," said McClure, who six years ago led a federal task
force to assess Title I. "This program isn't working as it was intended to
work. II
       In 1993, the Education Department released preliminary results of an
ongoing, comprehensive study that measured Title I's effect on 40,000
students
and the achievement gap. The study found that Title I assistance "did not
compensate for the initial deficiencies of the disadvantaged students." It
also pointed out that the lowest-achieving poor students often received
instruction from Title I aides.
       Some Title I advocates complain that aides are scapegoats for a
program
that, at last count, contributed only 2 cents of every local, state and
federal dollar spent on public education. Title I accounts for 42% of every
federal dollar spent on education from kindergarten through high school.
       Congress made sweeping changes in its 1994 reauthorization of Title I,
requiring that students in the program be held to the same academic
standards
as other children. It also required for the first time that aides have at
least a high school diploma.
       LeTendre, the department's director of Title I, said she was
II incensed II

that Congress set such a minimal requirement for aides who often help
instruct
students. She said surveys show that only 13% of the Title I aides hold
college degrees:
       And while she applauded efforts that encouraged Title I aides to get
their teaching degrees, she said it was an "absolute must" that more
certified
instructors be hired with program money.
       A new comprehensive assessment of these reforms will not be finished


until the spring; early indications are that the number of aides
nationwide is
declining.
      But the cutbacks have not come easily.
      After much coaxing and coalition-building, school officials in pueblo,
Colo., }aid off 62 aides this summer, said Paul Ruiz, partner of the
Education
Trust, a Washington nonprofit group that helped broker the change. Most of
those receiving pink slips were Latino "moms and dads, some of whom worked
as
teacher aides for 10, 15 years," he said.
      The money saved from the dismissal of school aides will be redirected
into professional training for teachers, Ruiz said.
      Education Trust abandoned a similar effort in Hartford, Conn., Ruiz
said,
where local official·s could not muster the "political will."

     The Gap
     The achievement gap between students attending high-poverty and low-
poverty schools ahs remained the same or grown bigger since the late 1980s,
standardized tests show. Poorer students lag behind their better-off peers
by
four grade levels in reading and two in math in 1996.
      Reading Scores (1988 through 1996)
      Affluent
      Impoverished
      Math Scores (1988 through 1996)
      Affluent
      Impoverished
      Note: Scores are from the National Assessment of Education Progress
tests
and reach 10 point difference between scores represents roughly one grade
level.
