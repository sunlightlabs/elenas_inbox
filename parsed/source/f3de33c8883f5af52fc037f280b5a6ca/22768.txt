      HEALTHCARE ROUNDTABLE WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE RESIDENTS

                            DATE:           February 18,1999
                            LOCATION: Dover Municipal Building
                            TIME:           11:15am - 12:05pm
                            FROM:           Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      To discuss the wide range of health care challenges currently facing the nation with a
      group of New Hampshire residents. You will also praise Governor Jeanne Shaheen's
      efforts to address may of the health care challenges facing New Hampshire.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will highlight several of the initiatives in your FY2000 budget to improve access
      to and the quality of health care services, including:

     Addressing growing long-term care needs. Your budget includes a historic new
      initiative to support elderly and disabled Americans with long-term care needs or
      the millions of family members who care for them. This initiative invests over $6
      billion over 5 years in long term care, including a $1,000 tax credit to compensate
      for the cost of long-term care services; a new $625 million National Family
      Caregiver Program that helps states provide direct services and support and
      information for families with long-term care needs; a new proposal to enable States
      to expand home-and community-based care to the same income levels as for nursing
      homes under Medicaid; and a national campaign to educate Medicare beneficiaries
      about long-term care options. New Hampshire has made efforts to expand
      community based care services for Medicaid enrollees and to provide critical
      information to the elderly and chronically ill adults about their long-term care
      options.

     Improve economic opportunities for Americans with disabilities. More than 70
      percent of Americans with disabilities are unemployed, often because they face
      significant barriers, such as the fact that they may lose health care. You have
      proposed a series of bold new initiatives to enable people with disabilities to return
      to work. This $3.2 billion (over 5 years) initiative includes full funding for the
                        Hex-Dump Conversion

    Jeffords-Kennedy-Roth-Moynihan Work Incentives Improvement Act which
    provides options for workers with disabilities to buy into Medicaid and Medicare; a
    $1,000 tax credit to help offset the cost of services and support people with
    disabilities need to work; and a new regulation that increases the amount that
    people with disabilities can earn and still maintain critical Social Security benefits.
    New Hampshire also provides community based services to individuals with
    disabilities through Medicaid, and the Vice President recently announced a new
    grant program through the Social Security Administration to help remove barriers
    to employment for people with disabilities.

   Helping small businesses provide health care coverage for their employees. Your
    budget includes a $44 million investment in targeted tax credits designed to
    encourage small businesses to participate in voluntary purchasing coalitions, that provide
    more choices to small businesses and their employees and make health care more
    accessible. This initiative provides: a new 10 percent tax credit for small businesses who
    decide to offer coverage by joining coalitions; encouraging private foundations to support
    coalitions by allowing their contributions towards these organizations to be tax exempt;
    and offering technical assistance to small business coalitions from the Administrators of
    the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. Governor Shaheen has proposed
    legislation that creates voluntary small business purchasing alliance to reduce costs
    and increase options for small businesses offering health insurance to their
    employees, and believes that the key to making her proposal work is outside financing
    sources and as such strongly supports the Administration's proposal

   Implementing the Children's Health Insurance Program, the largest investment in
    children's health in a generation. The Administration is committed to
    implementing the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and has
    developed a national outreach campaign to sign up every child eligible for Medicaid
    or CHIP coverage. New Hampshire, under Governor Shaheen's leadership, is one
    of forty-six other states who have already implemented the CHIP program, Healthy
    Kids, to provide health insurance to thousands of uninsured New Hampshire
    children.

   Protect Patients through a Strong, Enforceable Patients Bill of Rights. Once again,
    you called upon Congress to pass a strong federally enforceable patients' bill of
    rights, with a range of patient protections including: guaranteed access to needed
    specialists; access to emergency room services when and where the need arises,
    access to a meaningful independent and external appeals process for consumers to
    resolve differences with their health plans, and the right to be compensated when a
    health plan's decision causes a patient to be harmed or die. You are already doing
    everything you can to implement these protections by extending them to the 85
    million Americans covered by Federal health plans. Governor Shaheen has also
    proposed managed care reforms through the HMO Accountability Act that includes
    This new initiative takes steps to eliminate provider incentives to withold medically
    necessary care, prevents HMOs for removing providers from their network for
                             Automated Records Management System
                             Hex-Dump Conversion

            advocating on behalf of an HMO, and holds HMO Medical Directors accountable to
            the State Board of Medicine for treatment decisions.
