                 CLINTON-GORE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
                      REFORMING WELFARE

    On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and
    Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, fulfilling his longtime commitment to 'end
    welfare as we know it. ' As the President said upon signing, "... this legislation
    provides an historic opportunity to end welfare as we know it and transform our
    broken welfare system by promoting the fundamental values of work,
    responsibility, and family. "

               TRANSFORMING THE BROKEN WELFARE SYSTEM

     Overhauling the Welfare System with the Personal Responsibility Act: Last year the
    . President signed a bipartisan welfare plan that is dramatically changing the nation's
      welfare system into one that requires work in exchange for time-limited assistance. The
      law contains strong work requirements, a performance bonus to reward states for moving
      welfare recipients into jobs, state maintenance of effort requirements, comprehensive
      child support enforcement, and supports for families moving from welfare to work --
      including increased funding for child care and guaranteed medical coverage. State
      strategies are making a real difference in the success of welfare reform, specifically in
      job placement, child care and transportation.

     Law Builds on the Administration's Welfare Reform Strategy: Even before the
     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act became law, many states were well
     on their way to changing their welfare programs to jobs programs. By granting Federal
     waivers, the Clinton Administration allowed 43 states -- more than all previous
     Administrations combined -- to require work, time-limit assistance,make work pay,
     improve child support enforcement, and encourage parental responsibility. The vast
     majority of states have chosen to continue or build on their welfare demonstration
     projects approved by the Clinton Administration.

    Largest Decline in the Welfare Rolls in History: From January 1993 to June 1997, the
     number of people receiving welfare benefits fell by 26 percent, or 3.6 million recipients--
     the largest decline in the welfare rolls in history and the lowest percentage of the
     population on welfare since 1970. This historic decline occurred in response to the
     Administration's grants of Federal waivers to 43 states, the provisions of the new welfare
     reform law, and the strong economy.

    Mobilizing the Business Community: To make welfare reform it success and help move.
     a million people from welfare into the workforce by the year 2000, President Clinton has
     enlisted the business community's leadership. At the President's urging, the Welfare to
     Work Partnership was launched in May 1997 to lead the national business effort to hire
     people from the welfare rolls. Founded with 100 participating businesses, the
     Partnership pledged to reach 1,000 business within six months. In August 1997, in St.
     Louis, Missouri, the Partnership launched a city by city effort to work with employers,
     service providers and state and local governments to expand welfare to work
     opportunities. The Partnership provides technical assistance and support to businesses
                                                                                       anagement System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion               .
    around the country, including: a toll-free number (1-888-USAJOB1), the Partnership's
    Web site (www.welfaretowork.org) and a "Blueprint for Business" manual that contains
    information on finding, recruiting, training, hiring, and retaining former welfare
    recipients .

          ... and Civic, Religious and Non-profit Groups: The Vice President created the
    Welfare to Work Coalition to Sustain Success, a coalition of civic groups committed to
    helping former welfare recipients stay in the workforce and succeed. Tailoring their
    services to meet welfare recipients needs and the organizations' strengths, the Coalition
    will focus on providing mentoring and other support services. Charter members of the
    Coalition include: the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Baptist Joint Committee, the
    United Way, the YMCA, and fourteen other civic groups.

   Doing Our Fair Share with the Federal Government's Hiring Initiative: Under the
    Clinton Administration, the Federal workforce has been reduced by more than 300,000
    positions, the smallest the Federal government has been in thirty years. Yet, this
    Administration also believes that the Federal government, as the nation's largest
    employer, must lead by example. The.President asked the Vice President to oversee the
    Federal government's hiring initiative in which Federal agencies have committed to
    directly hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients in the next four years. Already, the
    federal government has hired nearly 2,000 welfare recipients, achieving in six
    months nearly 20 percent of the President's goal. As a part of this effort, the White
    House pledged, and has already hired, six welfare recipients.

   Enforcing Child Support - 50% Increase in Collections: The Clinton Administration
    collected a record $12 billion in child support in 1996 through tougher enforcement, an
    increase of $4 billion, or nearly 50 percent, since 1992. Not only are collections up, but
    the number of f~ilies that are actually receiving child support has also increased. In
    1996, the number of child support cases with collections rose to 4 million, an increase of
    43 percent, from 2.8 million in 1992. And paternity establishment, often the first crucial
    step in child support cases, has dramatically increased. In 1996, the number of .
    paternities established rose to nearly 1 million, almost double, from 516,000 in 1992.

          Making Deadbeat Parents Pay: The President's unprecedented and sustained
    campaign to make deadbeat parents pay is working. In addition to tougher enforcement
    including a strong partnership with states, President Clinton has taken executive action
    including: directing the Treasury Department to collect past-due child support from
    Federal payments including Federal income tax refunds and employee salaries; taking
    steps to Federal deny loans to any delinquent parents; issuing an executive order making
    the Federal government a model employer in the area of child support enforcement. The
    President also directed the Attorney General to submit legislation that strengthens the
    Child Support Recovery Act by prosecuting more parents who take egregious actions to
    avoid paying child support. And most significantly, the welfare reform law contains
    tough child support measures that President Clinton has long supported including: a
    national new hire reporting system; streamlined paternity establishment; uniform
    interstate child support laws; computerized state-wide collections; and tough new
    penalties. These five measures are projected to increase child support collections by an
    additional $24 billion over the next ten years, but first, all states must enact the state laws
                                                                  omnledRecores Management System

     to implement these tough new rules.                       Hex-Dwnp Conversion

    Breaking the Cycle of Dependency - Preventing Teen Pregnancy: Significant
     components of the President's comprehensive effort to reduce teen pregnancy became law
     when the President signed the 1996 Personal Responsibility Act. The law requires
     unmarried minor parents to stay in school and live at home or in a supervised setting;
     encourages "second chance homes" to provide teen parents with the skills and support
     they need; and provides $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education
     activities. Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has supported innovative and
     promising teen pregnancy prevention strategies; HHS-supported programs already reach
     about 30 percent or 1,410 communities in the United States. As part of this effort, the
     National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, a private nonprofit organization, was
     formed in response to the President's 1995 State of the Union. Notably, data shows we
     are making progress in reducing teen pregnancy -- teen births have fallen four years in a
     row, by 8 percent trom 1991 to 1995.


    BALANCED BUDGET HELPS MOVE PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

    $3 Billion to Help Move 1 Million People from Welfare to Work: Because of the
     President's leadership, the balanced budget includes the total funding requested by the
     President for the creation of his $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge fund. This
     program will help states and local communities move long-term welfare recipients into .
     lasting, unsubsidized jobs. These funds can be used for job creation, job placement and
     job retention efforts, including wage subsidies to private employers and other critical
     post-employment support services. The Department of Labor will provide oversight but
     most of the dollars will be placed, through the Private Industry Councils, in the hands of
     the localities who are on the front lines of the welfare reform effort. In addition, 25
     percent of the funds will be awarded by the Department of Labor on a competitive basis
     to support innovative welfare to work projects.

    A Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit for Employers: This tax credit will give employers an
     added incentive to hire long-term welfare recipients by providing a credit equal to 35
     percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the first year of employment, and 50 percent of
     the first $10,000 in wages in the second year, paid to new hires who have received
     welfare for an extended period. The credit is for two years per worker to encourage not
     only hiring, but also retention.
       RESTORING FAIRNESS AND PROTECTING THE M(jsf~rq~IBLE

The President made a commitment last year to fix several provisions in the welfare reform law
that had nothing to do with moving people from welfare to work. After months of continuous
refusals by"the Congressional leadership to consider these changes, the President fought for and
ultimately was successful in ensuring that the balanced budget protects the most vulnerable.

      Protects Immigrants Who Become Disabled and Those Currently Receiving
       Benefits: The balanced budget restores$I1.5 billion in SSI and Medicaid benefits for
       legal immigrants. The new law protects those immigrants now receiving assistance,
       ensuring that they will not be turned out of their apartments or nursing homes or
       otherwise left destitute. And for immigrants already here but not receiving benefits, the
       balanced budget does not change the rules retroactively. Immigrants in the country as of
       August 22, 1996 but not receiving benefits at that time who subsequently become
       disabled will also be fully eligible for SSI and Medicaid benefits.

      Helps People Who Want to Work but Can't Find a Job: The balanced restores $1.5
       billion in food stamp cuts. Last year's welfare reform bill restricted food stamps for
       able-bodied childless adults to only 3 out of every 36 months, unless they were working.
       This move ignored the fact that finding a job often takes time. The budget bill provides
       funds for an estimated 235,000 work slots over 5 years and food stamp benefits to those
       who are willing to work but, through no fault oftheir own, have not yet found
       employment. The balanced budget allows states to exempt up to 15 percent of the food
       stamp recipients (70,000 individuals monthly) who would otherwise be denied benefits as
       a result of the "3 in 36" limit.

      Protects Children by Keeping the Medicaid Guarantee: The balanced budget
       preserves the Federal guarantee of Medicaid coverage for the vulnerable populations who
       depend on it, and contains additional investments to extend coverage to uninsured
       children. It also ensures that 30,000 disabled children losing SSI because of the new
       tighter eligibility criteria keep their Medicaid coverage.

           STATES ARE SUCCEEDING IN REFO~IN~W~~~:RE

Many states have accepted the significant responsibilities in the welfare reform law and are using the
greater flexibility to reform welfare. State strategies are making a real difference in the success of
welfare reform, specifically in moving recipients from welfare 톞o work, child care and transportation ..
Here are a few examples:

WELFARE TO WORK
   Massachusetts and Pennsylvania Have Welfare-to-Work Tax Credits for Employers:
    According to a report from the National Governors' Association, Pennsylvania rewards
    employers for participating in their Employment Incentive Program (EIP) by providing up to
    $5,100 in state tax credits for each welfare recipient an employer hires. The employer can earn
    $1,500 of the possible tax credit by paying for or providing child care to the welfare recipients
    hired. The welfare recipient must be employed for at least one year for the employer to receive
    the financial incentives. Under Massachusetts' Full Employment Program, employers are
    entitled to an excise tax credit of $1 00 per month for each FEP employee hired; they can also
    receive wage subsidies of $2.50 per hour for up to nine months.
   Thirty-six States Are Using Welfare Checks to Subsidize Paychecks: 36 of the 50 states are
    using welfare checks to subsidize private employment. All states except Alabama, Connecticut,
    Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New
    Mexico, Tennessee, and Utah subsidize employment.

CHILD CARE
    24 States Are Increasing Their Spending Beyond What Is Needed to Match New Federal
     Child Care Funds: According to a survey by the American Public Welfare Association (the
     state welfare directors), 24 states plan to spend more of their own dollars than they need to in
     order to match the new federal child care funds. These 24 states are: Alaska, Arizona,
     Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,
     Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri; Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio,
     Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington State and Wyoming.                              .
    Several States Have Seamless Child Care Systems: Illinois, Michigan, and Washington are
     examples of states that provide child care subsidies based on income, not whether a parent used
     to be on welfare or not.

TRANSPORTATION
   . Michigan, Kentucky and Wisconsin Are Addressing the Transportation Challenges of
      Welfare Reform: Michigan and Wisconsin are tackling the transportation barriers many
      welfare recipients face. Because few families receiving public assistance own automobiles, it
      is often challenging getting workers to jobs in the outlying suburban areas. Michigan's
      Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation provides bus patrons with a ride from
      their stop to their work site. Wisconsin developed "Job Ride" in 1989 creating an innovative
      van pool system. Kentucky's "Empower Kentucky" initiative is integrating the transportation
      programs of four cabinet departments to improve transportation for underserved areas of the
      state.
     Connecticut is Using Welfare Block Grant Dollars to Fund Transportation: In
      Connecticut, the Governor has committed to using $2.2 million of the state's Temporary
      Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) dollars for transportation services for public transit

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

    operators across the state to provide new transportation services to move welfare recipients to
    work.
