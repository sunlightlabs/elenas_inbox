 TEXT:
 I think we should endorse this proposal.  It doesn't cost much, it would
 meet the President's objective of supporting homeownership for low-income
 families, and it is not run through HUD (the initiative is funded through
 the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and some direct sums to Habitat) .

 Paul:

 As we discussed, we would like to get Bruce to support a
 "Play-By-The-Rules" Homeownership Proposal. Our message would be simple
 with this proposal: if you play by the rules and pay your rent on time, we
 will provide you the opportunity to buy your own home (through downpayment
 assistance, closing costs, interest rate buydowns, or low-interest
 rehabilitation loans. The specifics are obviously more difficult and we
 are still working them out, but we need an increase in the NRC's budget to
 have a chance to create this program.

MEMORANDUM FOR GENE SPERLING

FROM:                 JONORSZAG

SUBJECT:              Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation


Background:

       Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) is a Federally funded, non-profit corporation
which provides technical and financial assistance to community-based affiliates which use
homeownership creation as a neighborhood renewal and stabilization strategy. These 177 community
organizations -- NeighborWorks Organizations (NWOs) -- serve large, inner-city communities,
mid-sized cities, and rural communities with programs tailored to serving the revitalization needs of
each individual low-income neighborhood. The NWOs .extend credit and counseling to lower-income
and often minority individuals if they buy or rehabilitate a home in the network's designated area.

       In FY96, NRC's budget was $38.7 million. This was increased to $50 million in FY97 and
$60 million in FY98. OMB has recommended a $30 million increase in NRC's FY99 budget.

Support for Increase:

       Additional funds in NRC allow us to put in a place a "Play-By-The-Rules" proposal. (We are
       still developing it, but see next bullet for some background.) DPC, OMB, HUD, and the NRC
       are all very supportive of this proposal.

      While we are still working on the proposal, here are some basic guidelines. Currently, there
       are about 7 million households that 'pay more than 50 percent of their monthly income on rent.
       Families that desire homeownership are often trapped in situations where they pay so much for
       rental housing that little is left to save for downpayments. These families often pay their rent,
       utilities, car payments, and other bills on time, but do not have the savings necessary to become
       a homeowner. The goal of this program will be simple. If you "play-by-the-rules," we are
       going to help them with their downpayment (up to about $2,000), closing costs (also up to
       about $2,000), with an interest-rate buydown, or a rehabilitation loan.

      An increase in NRC's budget can be seen as a part of the Race Initiative. As you can see from
       the numbers, this program -- while not race-based -- disproportionately helps minorities. Over
       60% of NRC's new homeowners are minorities (38% are African Americans, 20% are
       Hispanics, and 3% are others). These numbers are particularly impressive. For example, only
       about 5 percent of all mortgages and about 15 percent of government-backed loans are given to
       African Americans, yet 38 percent of NRC's go to African Americans. This could also be part
       of the Hispanic Initiative: 6 percent of all mortgages and 12 percent of government-backed
       loans go to Hispanics, but 20 percent of NRC's new homeowners are Hispanics.


                                                   1
                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

          NRC's total 1996 investment in distressed neighborhoods was $419 million, leveraging 10.8
           times the $38.7 million in Federal appropriations for NRC in that year. A $90 million
           appropriation would enable 24,000 families to secure or retain homeownership and would yield
           over $1 billion in collective lending and other direct investments by NeighborWorks
           organizations and financial institutions.

          NRC has an excellent track record. NRC has a higher risk portfolio than FHA: (1)
           loan-to-volume ratios range all the way up to 120 percent, while they are up to 102 percent
           under FHA; and (2) average borrower incomes are lower than FHA. But, NRC posts lower
           default rates -- 3-4 percent compared to 6-8 percent for FHA.

          Mortgage Banking reported on the NeighborWorks program in their September 1997 edition.
           They titled their story: "NeighborWorks is Working." They wrote that: "NeighborWorks
           organizations and their lender-partners are producing success rates that have lenders grinning
           broadly with enthusiasm."
