                                            (Summary of Correia, Rundlet, Bueno Memos)


Near-Term Pro.iects
 Issue Area           Status Update
 Worker                DPC held a meeting to discuss issues related to worker exploitation.
 Exploitation!         Identified issues: (1) Current criminal and labor statutes restrict efforts to prosecute worker exploitation cases and
 Trafficking of         discourage victims from reporting these cases; and (2) there is no comprehensive law that sanctions the range of
 Women and              activities recognized as trafficking (of women and children) or that protects victims.
 Children              Goals: (1) Coordinate the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of worker exploitation and trafficking cases; (2)
                        establish a central information bank of information; (3) address the unique needs of victims of worker exploitation
                        and trafficking where they will be more willing to come forward and report these crimes; and (4) build support for
                        the President's Crime Bill proposals.
                       Next steps: (1) Continue to support law enforcement efforts to prosecute cases; and (2) identify additional resources
                        to combat worker exploitation and trafficking.

 CRA/Commercial        Rundlet has met with representatives from Justice, Treasury, HUD, and OMB.
 and Residential       Identified issues: (1) There is a current battle on the Hill, led by Senator Gramm, over the continued relevance ofthe
 Lending                CRA -- Senator Gramm supports exempting banks with assets totaling less than $100 million (38% of all banks)
                        from CRA's requirements and creating a safe harbor for institutions that currently have a satisfactory CRA rating
                        (98% of all banks); (2) the perennial effort on the part of Justice and HUD to increase the number, scope, and
                        timeliness of referrals from bank regulatory agencies is difficult to actualize absent some new enforcement efforts by
                        the regulatory agencies; and (3) we are dependent on the Federal Reserve to revise Regulations Band C, and they
                        have put off making such changes until June.
                       Next steps: DPC, NEC, Treasury, and Justice are working to protect CRA in the context of financial services
                        modernization. In addition, HUD has committed to the following: (1) creating an inter-agency task force to curtail
                        predatory lending practices that occur in the subprime mortgage and commercial lending markets; (2) working with
                        industry and civil rights groups to create a voluntary code of conduct for lenders; (3) studying the impact on minority
                        borrowing of the more recent lending practices of credit scoring and automated underwriting; (4) improving HMDA
                        reporting; and (5) developing guidance on proper lending discrimination audits.

 EEOBacklog            Goal: Publish regulations that will reduce the federal sector EEO backlog and improve the process.
                       Next step: Support efforts to clear the regulation and assist in its implementation.

 Issue Area            Status Update

 Race-Conscious         Next steps: (1) Develop and distribute guidance to higher education institutions on the current state of the law with
 Admissions              regard to voluntary affirmative action in admissions; (2) make policy decisions on using standardized tests to assess

                         affirmative action in magnet school admissions; (6) consider the use of narrowly-tailored affirmative action in charter

                         regard to Title IX and single-sex education.

 National Origin        DPC held a meeting to discuss national origin discrimination on the basis of language.
 Discrimination!        Goals: (1) Eliminate language-based discrimination in the work place, including speak-English-only rules and
 Language Rights         discriminatory employment practices based on accent; and (2) eradicate discrimination that results in the denial of
                         equal access to government programs of Limited English Proficient (LEP) persons.
                        Next steps: (1) Focus EEOC's enforcement efforts in this area and begin outreach efforts to communities that speak
                         languages other than English to educate them of their rights; (2) develop recommendations with regard to educating
                         employers and employees of civil rights laws that prohibit language-based employment discrimination; and (3)
                         ensure that agencies are complying with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act as it relates to provisions of services to LEP
                         persons by providing legal guidance.

 Hate Crimes            Next steps: (1) Increase support by state and local law enforcement; (2) address federalism and first amendment            :x:
                         concerns; (3) increase outreach, including meeting with the ACLU to resolve their concerns and organizing a White
                                                                                                                                                    '"

                         House event for early April; and (4) consider extending this effort beyond legislation to include harassment.

                                                                                                                                                    :::>
 Wage Gap               Identified issue: There is currently no regular collection of wage data by any federal agency and we thus have no
                         adequate basis for monitoring wage patterns by individual employers or industries.
                        Next steps: (1) Consider what data collection requirements the Administration would support in the Daschle bill; and       I-
                         (2) determine whether we should require additional data from government contractors per DOL's recommended
                         revision of its current data collection requirements.
Diverse and Skilled    Goals: (1) Increase diversity in the science, technology, and engineering (ST&E) workforce; (2) increase
Workforce               opportunities for disabled Americans; and (3) eliminate job barriers stemming from discrimination based on sexual
                        orientation.
                       Recommended next step: The President or Vice President to meet with high-tech industry leaders in about two
                        months with the expectation that we could announce the following industry commitments: (1) to establish
                        scholarships; (2) to form partnerships with HBCUs, Hispanic Serving Institutions, inner-city schools, state and local
                        governments, or others; (3) to develop corporate internship programs; and (4) to establish a permanent
                        industry-funded organization to promote these kinds of opportunities.
                       Other next steps: (1) Reach out to high-tech firms; (2) improve recruiting efforts by federal agencies; (3) hold an
                        EEOC Commission meeting to highlight the lack of minorities and women in some job categories; and (4) call
                        attention to an upcoming OSTP report on the lack of diversity in the ST&E workforce.

Authoritative Data     Next steps: To support the CEA-led effort to expand and improve our current statistical ability to measure and track
Collection              discrimination in five key sectors (labor markets, education, housing, criminal justice, and health services): (1) the
                        National Research Council is creating a Roundtable with agencies and outside academics to develop a methodology
                        for accurately determining the presence or absence of discrimination; and (2) Labor, Education, Justice, HUD, and
                        HHS are developing workplans for utilizing the FY2000 money budgeted for measuring discrimination.
