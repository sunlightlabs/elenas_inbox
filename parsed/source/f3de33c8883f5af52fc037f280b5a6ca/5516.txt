MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:       Health Insurance Coverage Initiatives in the FY 1999 Budget

Overview

        Throughout your Administration, you have worked to enact legislation to expand access
to affordable health insurance. Your signing of the Balanced Budget Act included an
unprecedented $24 billion investment for state-based children's health insurance programs. This
historic initiative will clearly reduce the number of uninsured. However, there are other
deserving populations whom we could target in our step-by-step reforms. These include the
pre-65 year olds (referenced in the Medicare memo), workers between jobs, and workers in small
businesses. In addition, we are working on proposals to expand Medicaid coverage to people
with AIDS and disabilities through demonstration programs. The policy development of these
proposals is still underway, but we reference them in this memo because we believe that they are
sound and inexpensive enough to justify being considered for your FY 1999 budget.

         Taken together, these are not large initiatives, summing to around $10 billion over 5
years, which is less than half of investments in this year's budget and less than a fraction of the
premium assistance in the Health Security Act. Having said this, none of your advisors believe
that it will be possible to find $10 billion in available resources for these investments. Most
Medicare and Medicaid savings were included in last year's deficit reduction effort. There may
be $0.5 to 1 billion over 5 years in Medicaid savings, but those savings will be difficult to
achieve and there may be other claims on them (e.g., child care). It could also be argued that,
given the link between tobacco and health care, any residual revenue from the tobacco settlement
or a tax could be considered for coverage initiatives, particularly those related to children.

        Your advisors uniformly agree that we need to take all actions possible to achieve if not
exceed your goal of increasing insurance coverage for 5 million children. A series of proposals
are described to accomplish that goal. There is less agreement on whether we address a new
group of uninsured people in this budget. Labor strongly supports the workers between jobs
demonstration; of all health initiatives in the budget, it is their highest priority. OMB also
supports that demonstration if sufficient funds are available. While HHS believes that this
proposal has merit, they are skeptical that it will achieve significant support since it has not in the
past three years of trying. The same holds true for the small group purchasing cooperatives.


                                                  1
A.     CHILDREN'S HEALTH OUTREACH                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

        The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides funds for coverage of
millions ofwortting families' children, a pppulation that previously had trouble affording
coverage. It also builds upon a strong Medicaid program that this Administration has worked so
hard to protect. However, important work remains to be done. In particular, we need to work
with states to emoll the millions of uninsured children in these programs.

        Medicaid eligible children are especially at risk of remaining uninsured. Over three
million uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid. Educating and emolling families about
their options has always been a problem, but recently has become more challenging. The growth
in the number of children covered by Medicaid leveled off in 1995 and, according to the Census,
dropped by 6 percent in 1996. While some of this may be due to the lower number of children
in poverty, some may also result from families' misunderstanding of their children's continued
eligibility for Medicaid regardless of the changes in welfare.

Options to Increase Outreach for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program

        To address the need for children's health outreach, we propose a series of policy options.
First, we could offer states a bonus for emolling new, uninsured children, giving them an
incentive to find these children. Second, we could build upon a new option in the Balanced
Budget Act called "presumptive eligibility", that essentially allows children to be given
temporary Medicaid coverage while they are formally emolled in CHIP or Medicaid. Third, we
would clarify the law so that states may use their TANF allotments for outreach at 90 percent
matching for all children, not just those transitioning from welfare. Finally; we will work on a
series of policies to simplify the application and emollment process, making easier to access the
system. Together, these initiatives could cost $0.5 to 1.5 billion over five years. Preliminary
discussions with NGA and some children's advocates suggest they'strongly support these efforts.

        Enhanced match for outreach. One option for improving state outreach is to provide
enhanced match to emoll new, uninsured children in Medicaid. At the end of the year, if a state
can document that it has increased its emollment over baseline, it receives a increased matching
amount per newly covered child. This policy rewards states only if they succeed in outreach,
rather than just matching activities that mayor may not work. Its costs depend on the amount of
the enhanced match, but estimates range from $0.5 to I billion over five years.

         Moving outreach to schools and child care sites. We could build upon the
presumptive eligibility provision in the Balanced Budget Act to make it easier to emoll children
in Medicaid and CHIP. This could be done by changing the law to allow schools and
appropriate child care sites, at the states' option, to determine "presumptive eligibility". This
means that certified people may, using a simple test, give a child up to two months of Medicaid
coverage on the spot as the application is processed. Additionally, under the Balanced Budget,
states that use presumptive eligibility must pay for its costs out of the CHIP allotment, reducing

                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

the amount available for other coverage. States have advised us that thisis a disincentive to take
this option. HCF A actuaries preliminarily estimate that this would cost $400 million over 5
years.

        Accessing 90 percent funds for outreach. A third way to increase financing for
children's health outreach is to clarify the uses ofa special fund set aside in TANF for outreach
for children losing welfare. This $500 million fund is allocated to states with a 90 percent
matching rate for outreach activities. We would expand its use to all children, not just welfare
children. HCFA Actuaries preliminarily estimate that this would cost $0.2 billion over 5 years
(the cost of the new coverage generated by these efforts). NGA strongly supports this change.

        Simplifying enrollment. A simple, accessible enrollment process from beginning to
end could encourage more families to enroll their children in Medicaid or CHIP. To help create
such a process, we propose several actions, all of which are low cost initiatives. First, we could
streamline the application process by simplify Medicaid eligibility and by encouraging the use of
simple, mail-in applications. HCFA has already developed a model, single application form for
both Medicaid and CHIP. We could condition some of the financial incentives, described
above, on using a single or simple application. Second, we are reviewing the feasibility and
costs of a nationwide 1-800 number that will link families with their state or local offices. Such
a number could be placed in public service announcements, on the bottom of school lunch
program applications, and on children's goods like diaper boxes, for example, allowing families
easy access to information.

Departmental Positions

       There is unanimous support across agencies for focusing on children's health outreach.
For HHS and Treasury, it is their first priority in all health initiatives. NECIDPC believe that
aggressive outreach will be needed to meet or exceed the Administration's goal of covering 5
million uninsured children. Although we believe this policy will receive validation by policy
experts,children's advocates, and Governors alike, this package of outreach initiatives may be a
communications challenge so soon after the enactment of the $24 billion base children's health
program. Given its importance, we should also consider how outreach could be done in the
context of the tobacco settlement. Since one of the stated uses of the $368 billion settlement
was children's health, it is possible that we should fund this initiative in that way. We also
could consider allowing states to keep some of the Federal funds if they use them for children's
outreach.

B.     WORKERS BETWEEN JOBS DEMONSTRATION

        Families who lose health insurance while they are between jobs are a small but important
group of uninsured Americans. These families pay for health insurance for most of their lives,
but go through brief periods without coverage when they are temporarily unemployed. If they.
experience a catastrophic illness during this transition, the benefit of their years' worth of
premium payments is lost. Worse, for families with an ill child or a worker with a chronic
condition, the loss of health insurance while between jobs can make it financially impossible to
regain coverage.

Limited Demonstration

        This policy option is a modification of the program that we have carried in our last three
budgets. It would award grants to several states to provide temporary premium assistance to
eligible families. States would use this money to partially subsidize families' premium
payments for up to 6 months. To truly test how best to address thispopulation's needs, we
would select states using a range of approaches like COBRA, Medicaid, or covering the parents
of children covered by CHIP. Since it is a grant program, the costs are a policy choice. To give
a sense of the coverage for the options, last year's $10 billion proposal covered about 3.3 million
people. If we assume the same set of policy parameters, a demonstration of $1 billion over 5
years would coverage about 300,000, of$2.5 billion would cover about 700,000, and it would
take about $3.5 billion to cover about 1 million people.

Departmental Positions

        On policy grounds, all of the agencies support this policy. It has been in our last three
budgets because of its merits. This policy remains Labor's first priority. They view the
unemployed uninsured as a particularly vulnerable and important group to target. They also
believe that this is a particularly important policy in the context of the trade debate and worker
insecurity issues. OMB would support this initiative if there are sufficient funds. HHS has
always been supportive of this policy but feels as though circumstances have not changed to
make this policy viable this year when it has not been in the past. They would focus the funds
on the children's outreach option. DPCINEC are concemed about dropping this policy
altogether and do support a demonstration. However, if resources are limited, we would
advocate for the children's outreach initiative before this proposal.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
· C.    VOLUNTARY PURCHASING COOPERATIVES

         Workers in small firms are most likely to be uninsured. About one-third of workers in
 firms with fewer than 10 employees lack health insurance - more than twice the nationwide
 average. While 88 percent of workers in firms with 250 or more workers are offered health
 insurance, only 41 percent of workers in firms with less than 10 workers are offered coverage.
 This results in large part from the fact that the small group health insurance market does not
 function as well as the large group market. Studies have shown that administrative costs are
 higher and that small businesses pay more for the same benefits as larger firms.

 Grants to States

         Given the disadvantages faced by small firms, the question is: are there policies that can
 make insurance more affordable for small businesses and their employees? In the last three
 budgets, we have included a policy to provide seed money for states to establish voluntary
 purchasing cooperatives. These cooperatives would allow small employers to pool their
 purchasing power to try to negotiate better rates for their employees. This year, we propose both
 the original policy and a variation: a competitive grant approach so that fewer states could apply
 for a smaller amount of money. The total costs would be $50 to 100 million over 5 years.

 Departmental Positions

          All agencies remain supportive of this policy and believe it should be included in this
 year's budget. It is important that we have some initiative that illustrates our understanding that
 a major problem of lack of insurance continues to exist in the small employer community. In
 the past, we have been unable to get this policy passed into law primarily because it has been
 viewed as an altemative to an initiative proposed by Congressman Fawell. His approach would
 allow virtually all small businesses to self-insure and in so doing escape all state regulation.
 Governors and consumer groups have consistently opposed the Fawell approach, mostly
 because of their concerns that it would make the small business insurance market for those who
 elected not to se1finsure an even more unstable market than it already ss. We have raised
 similar concerns and have also pointed out that a Fawell-type approach would eliminate all of the
 consumer protections state insurance regulation currently provides. Based on our preliminary
 conversations with Congressman Fawell, it may be that our impasse may be resolvable since this
 is his last year as a Member of Congress and there are some compromises that seem within reach.

D.     AIDS DEMONSTRATION                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

        As described in the memo on AIDS initiatives, the Health Care Financing Administration
is looking into options to see ifthere is a feasible demonstration for providing Medicaid coverage
for certain therapies earlier than when people have full-blown AIDS. This demonstration would
allow a few states or cities to have a capped amount of funds to provide Medicaid coverage to
people with AIDS earlier in the progression of the disease. The details and merits of such a
policy are still in development, but we think that we could limit this funding to $40 to 50 million
over five years.


E.     DEMONSTRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

        A similar demonstration is being considered for people with disabilities. As you know
from your meeting with the disability community, there is a strong desire to experiment with
ways to encourage states to de-institutionalize people with disabilities. Often, these people
could live in the community if they has Medicaid support. However, states have been reluctant
to move extensively in this direction because for every one person that they move out of a
nursing home due to this benefit, several who are already in the community but being cared for
by their families would turn to Medicaid for help. For this same reason, HCFA is still trying to
determine whether a limited demonstration is possible. The ideas being considered would both
test options for encouraging de-institutionalization and develop a infonnation strategy to
encourage states to use models that work. If possible, we would limit funding to $50 million
over five years.
