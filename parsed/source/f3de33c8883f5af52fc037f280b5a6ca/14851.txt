                   LIVE ABC RADIO TOWN HALL MEETING
                        STRAIGHT TALK ON DRUGS

                          DATE:           March 12, 1997
                          LOCATION:       East Room
                          TIME:           11:00 AM EST
                          FROM:           Mike McCurry & Bruce Reed

I. PURPOSE

       This program is a live, one-hour radio broadcast focusing
       on the increasing use of illegal drugs, alcohol and tobacco
       by America's youth.    The broadcast will offer you an
       opportunity to discuss with children and parents the
       importance of an open and early dialogue on drug abuse.   It
       will also allow you to highlight the Administration's  focus
       on protecting children through your national drug strategy,
       which is part of an overall mission of giving America's
       children a safe, wholesome, constructive upbringing that
       begins with a drug-free life, appropriate health care, safe
       streets and a decent education.

II.    BACKGROUND

       The ABC Radio and Television Network is dedicating the
       entire month of March to a major public service campaign to
       encourage parents to talk with their children about drugs.
        The campaign includes specially produced public service
       announcements aired every network hour for the entire month,
       as well as programming from the ABC News, Daytime and
       Entertainment divisions.

       The Radio Town Hall Meeting is designed to be a discussion
       on the growing danger drugs pose to America's children. The
       program will be broken into four main segments, in which
       specific attention will be given to:

            The declining age of first-time drug users
            The medical effects of drugs
            Inhalants and gateway drugs
            Parents who once used drugs and their strategy for talking
             to children
                                             Hex-Dump Conversion


         Approaching parents for advice
         Media messages on drugs
         Responding to peer pressure
         Solutions: Programs that work and information and
          resources available to all
       While studies have shown that drug use among teens in America
       has doubled, children whose parents have talked to them about
       the risks of drugs are half as likely to use drugs. A recent
       ABC News-Washington Post poll finds contradictory responses
       from teenagers and their parents when comparing their
       perceptions on drugs.

          85% of parents say they have had a serious talk with the
           child about drugs; 45% of teens say the same
          60% of parents say their child knows someone in school
           with a serious drug problem; 38% of teens say the same
          52% of parents say that drug abuse in local schools is
           a serious problem or crisis; 34% of teens say the same
                                       (Washington Post, March 4, 1997)

       The audience for the town hall meeting is comprised of 31
       students and 14 parents, doctors and counselors.    The
       audience is geographically diverse, representing Los Angeles
       and Sacramento California, Baltimore, Woburn and
       Springfield, Massachusetts, New York City, Detroit, and
       Washington, DC. Several of the students are recovering
       substance abusers, several are drug-free honor students from
       schools in drug-infested neighborhoods. See attached bios
       for further information.

       NOTE: You will be using a hard-wired lavaliere microphone,
       with a hand-held microphone for backup.  The audience will
       be heard through boom microphones operated by ABC radio
       technicians.
