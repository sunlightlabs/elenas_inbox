SUBJECT:     BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND CALIFORNIA POLITICS

OVERVIEW

      The "English for the Children" initiative, sponsored by Republican and former
      gubernatorial candidate Ronald Unz, is planned for the June 1998 ballot. The initiative
      would move California's 1.4 million non-English proficient students from ''bilingual
      education" classes into an intensive program of "sheltered English immersion."
      Bilingual education would remain an option for parents who specifically request it
      through a waiver. Supporters and opponents both agree that the measure would
      essentially end bilingual education in California, and probably spark a move to do the
      same nationwide.

      Half of the children in America who are classified as "nonproficient" in English live in
      California. Most of these students come from Spanish-speaking homes. California
      spends approximately $300 million annually on bilingual education.

      The question of whether to abolish bilingual education for these mostly Latino children is
      a politically charged question in California. The initiative is California's third
      potentially divisive "race" initiative in 4 years. In 1994, Proposition 187 barred public
      benefits for illegal immigrants. In 1996, Proposition 209 ended affirmative action.

THE POLITICS

      The gut reaction of most Californians is that public school instruction should be
      conducted in English. Most people--Hispanic, Caucasian, Republican and
      Democrat--want kids to learn English as early as possible by the most effective means
      possible. Eleven years ago, Californians resoundingly approved a measure making
      English the state's official language.


      The recent Los Angeles Times poll reflects this basic sentiment. The poll asked all
      registered voters whether they would vote for or against an initiative "that would require
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
    all public school instruction to be conducted in English and for students not fluent in
    English to be placed in a short-term English immersion program." The poll found 75
    percent to 80 percent support for the initiative among every single voting group in the
    state. Liberals support it 2-to-l. Latino voters support the initiative by a ration of 84
    percent to 16 percent. Latino parents, like other parents, want their children to learn
    English and prefer that their children's courses be taught in English.

    People disagree on the best way to achieve that result, or whether there's one best way in
    all circumstances. Nobody thinks it is bad for students to be bilingual. People disagree
    on whether bilingual education is achieving that goal, or leaving students "limping along
    in both, masters of neither."

    Under the best circumstances, the "English for Children" initiative will provoke a healthy
    debate on the merits of bilingual education in California. But, that is unlikely. Even
    though many Latinos may privately feel bilingual education has failed, they and other
    voters may be reluctant to attack such a "sacred cow."

    The success of this initiative will depend more than anything else on the language in
    which it is framed. If the initiative is framed as anti-immigration, anti-affirmative action,
    anti-Latino, then Latinos are likely to fight against what they perceive to be "another
    racist campaign." Given the history of Propositions 187 and 209, it is likely this
    initiative will devolve into nasty hand-to-hand combat over race.

    The divisive political rhetoric is heating up on both sides. The initiative's supporters
    declare it is "shameful that so many politicians continue to support a program which they
    realize does not work." Opponents of the initiative call it "anti-Latino racism."

    At this time, most elected officials have not taken a position, but the line-up is taking
    shape. Last week, the California Teacher's Association came out against the Initiative.
    On November 23, the United Teachers of Los Angeles will vote. Both sides have
    signed up endorsements that signal a tough fight ahead: Latino teachers say they support
    the initiative and a few Republican State Legislators say they oppose it. (See attached
    list)

CONCLUSION

    It does not make political sense for us to take a position on the initiative at this time.
    First, we must assume for now that the Unz initiative is going to pass by a large margin,
    and it would take huge money to defeat it. Second, this initiative raises a California
    state issue that begs the question of federal "meddling."

    Third, a popular Democratic President's opposition to the initiative will entice Governor
    Wilson, who has remained silent, to oppose the President and support the initiative.
    Other Republicans will follow Wilson's lead. We are then in the position ofa sitting
    President fighting a sitting Governor over a California issue. We do not want this.

    Fourth, a Presidential position at this point could adversely effect the 1998 elections in
    California. Given the presumed popularity of the initiative, we may assume that
                                                                     lJ"x-DIdH1fl, Conversion

     Democratic candidates in the State may support it. Ifthe President opposes the initiative,
     it may cause a political disagreement between the Democratic President and Democratic
     candidates, and thus give the Republicans a "wedge" issue they'll readily exploit. If the
     President supports the initiative, he risks alienating "base voters" who the Democratic
     primary candidates must capture for a win. Thus, the President's least risky position in
     terms ofthe 1998 elections is to allow the candidates to make their own political
     determinations independent of the President.

     Fifth, the State Legislature is considering drafting bi-partisan legislation which strikes a
     compromise between the Unz initiative and the position taken by the California Teacher's
     Association. The legislation may be drafted by January. Our involvement any earlier
     will ensure negotiations collapse.

RECOMMENDATION

1.   Keep the powder dry. Avoid knee jerk reactions. Do not get involved in the heated
     political rhetoric over the initiative. Wait for State Legislature's compromise.
2.   Stay on the Offense. Unpack this issue and go back to what is at stake. Take a
     position that supports education for the 21 st Century: bilingual graduates (however we
     get there), computers in the schools, local school flexibility.
3.   Consult with gubematorial candidates, Hispanic Caucus, Asian and Hispanic leaders,
     unions, and educational groups before making any decision on the initiative.
4.   If we oppose the initiative, plan to spend a great deal of money to win.

CURRENT POLITICAL ARGUMENTS

    ARGUMENTS USED TO SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE (To Abolish Bilingual Education)

               "Bilingual education" is a failt<d program.
                      The number of students classified as "limited English proficient"
                       has more than doubled since 1982.
                      The number of students reclassified as "English proficient" has
                       remained flat. Only 5% of students graduate to proficiency in a
                       given year.

               Bilingual Education does not work if it is not done right, and California
                cannot do bilingual education right.
                      Only a third of supposedly bilingual classes are taught by
                       credentialed bilingual teachers.
                      California schools have been trying to recruit and train more
                       bilingual teachers for 25 years.
                      Class-size reduction has made the teacher shortage even more
                       acute.
                      California can't offer. a high-quality bilingual program to more than
                       a small number of students - - estimated at about 10% of English
                       leamers.


    ARGUMENTS USED TO OPPOSE THE INITIATIVE (Save Bilingual Education)

               Initiative would virtually end bilingual education.
               Initiative Process is poorly designed for dealing with complex education
                Issues.
               Initiative removes flexibility from local schools over educational
                decisions.
               Initiative exposes teachers and other educators to personal liability
                lawsuits.

          ALTERNATIVE VIEW
              Democrat Al Checchi opposes the initiative but thinks bilingual education has
               failed. He favors intensive language schooling of 3 and 4 year olds who do not
               speak English. Separate provisions would be made for students who are older
               when they arrive in California schools.
