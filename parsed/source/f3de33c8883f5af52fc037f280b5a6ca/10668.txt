FACT SHEET: ROUND II
      The application process for Round II Empowerment Zone designation was highly
       competitive. The Department of Agriculture received 160 applications representing
       communities in 38 States and the Department of Housing and Urban Development
       received 119 applications representing communities in 44 States and the District of
       Columbia.

      The reviews were conducted by an inter-departmental team of specialists. They
       examined the comprehensiveness of the strategic plans, the extent of citizen participation
       in the planning and implementation 'process, and the strength of the commitments by local
       organizations to follow through during implementation.

      The partnerships between residents, government and the private sector that were created
       or enhanced by the communities during this application process and the public and
       private sector financial commitments that were made to revitalize their communities, are
       valuable products of this process.
