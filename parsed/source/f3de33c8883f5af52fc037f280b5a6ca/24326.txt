              THE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR PASSAGE OF EQUAL PAY
                   LEGISLATION AND RELEASES COUNCIL
              OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS' REPORT ON THE WAGE GAP
                               June 10, 1998


Today the President will commemorate the thirty-fifth anniversary of President Kennedy's
signing of the Equal Pay Act and will urge passage of legislation to strengthen the laws that
prohibit wage discrimination against women. In addition, the President will release a Council of
Economic Advisers' (CEA) report on the gender wage gap, and announce a Department of Labor
report that provides a historical perspective of the wage gap. The President will be joined by Dr.
Dorothy Height, President Emeritus ofthe National Council of Negro Women, who was at the
signing ceremony of the Equal Pay Act in 1963.

Legislation to Improve Enforcement of Wage Discrimination Laws. The President will call
on Congress to pass legislation, introduced by Senator Daschle and Congresswoman DeLauro, to
strengthen laws prohibiting wage discrimination. The highlights of this legislation include:

      Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The legislation adds full compensatory
       and punitive damages as remedies, in a,ddition to the liquidated damages and back pay
       awards currently available under the EPA. This proposal would put gender-based wage
       discrimination on equal footing with wage discrimination based on race or ethnicity, for
       which uncapped compensatory and punitive damages are already available.

      Non-retaliation provision. The bill would prohibit employers from punishing employees
       for sharing salary information with their co-workers. Currently, employers are free to
       take action against employees who share wage information. Without the ability to learn
       about wage disparities, it is difficult for women to evaluate whether there is wage
       discrimination.

      Training, Research, and Pay Equity Award. The Daschle-DeLauro bill provides for
       increased training for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission employees on matters
       involving the discrimination of wages; research on discrimination in the payment of
       wages; and the establishment ofthe "The National Award for Pay Equity in the
       Workplace," which will recognize and promote the achievements of employers that
       have made strides to eliminate pay disparities.

CEA Report on the Wage Gap. The President will announce a report by the CEA that shows
that a significant gap between the wages of women and men remains today although it has
narrowed substantially since the signing of the Equal Pay Act.

      Gender Pay Gap Has Closed: Today, Women Earn 75 Cents for Every Dollar Men Earn.
       In 1963, the year that the Equal Pay Act was signed, women earned 58 cents for every
       dollar men earned. Today, women earn about 75 cents for every dollar men earn -- a
       29-percent increase over the 1963 levels. The gender gap has narrowed faster among
                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

       younger women and among married women with children. And relative to all male
       workers, wage gains have been faster for black and white women than for Hispanic
       women.

      Rise in Work Experience And Move To Higher-Paying Jobs Explain Part of Narrowing
       of Wage Gap. Over the past 20 years, increases in women's average work experience
       and movement into higher-paying occupations have played a major role in increasing
       women's pay relative to men's. Changes in family status, in industry structure, and
       unionization have also worked to narrow the wage gap, while the rising returns to skills
       and increased wage inequality would have, by themselves, widened the pay gap.

      Much of Gender Gap Is "Unexplained." In the 1980s, about one-third of the gender pay
       gap was explained by differences in the skills and experience that women bring to the
       labor market and about 28 percent was due to differences in industry, occupation, and
       union status among men and women. This leaves over one-third of the gender pay gap
       ''unexplained'' by factors such as educational attainment, work experience, and
       occupational choice.

      Labor Market Discrimination Persists. The evidence is that labor market discrimination
       against women persists. One indirect and rough measure of the extent of discrimination
       remaining in the labor market is the ''unexplained'' difference in pay. And academic
       studies -- whether looking at pay differences' between men and women in very similar
       jobs or by comparing pay to specific measures of productivity -- have consistently found
       evidence of ongoing discrimination in the labor market.

Department of Labor Report Provides a Historical Perspective on the Wage Gap. The
President also will announce a Department of Labor report that provides a thirty-five year
perspective on the wage gap. This report focuses on three periods since the signing of the Equal
Pay Act -- 1960-1975, 1975-1985, and 1985-1997 -- and highlights the increased participation of
women in the labor force, the changing occupations of women, and the emergence of more
women-owned businesses.

      Women's Labor Force Participation Has Increased. Women's labor force participation
       rate rose from 37.7 percent in 1960 to almost 60 percent in 1997.

      Increased Contributions by Women to Family Income. Between 1995 and 1996 alone,
       the number of families with two working parents increased by nearly half a million,
       making equal pay even more of a family issue. In these years, both parents were
       employed in 63.9 percent of married-couple families with children 18 and younger, while
       28.2 percent of these families had an employed father and homemaker mother.
