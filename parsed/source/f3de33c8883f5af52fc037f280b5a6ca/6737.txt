                                                 March 18, 1998



         The Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS endorsed the following demands of the

         African-American Consultants to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

         African-American Initiative. These demands along with the Council endorsement will be

         transmitted to the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

                         Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS


                                   Passed Recommendation


LEADERSHIP RECOMMENDA nON


In its ongoing Congressional lobbying related to FY 1999 budget and appropriations, the
Council urges the Administration to advocate and fully support increased HIV/AIDS funding
levels above those proposed in the President's own FY 1999 budget.

In so doing, the Council urges the Administration's full support for FY 1999 budget and
appropriations funding levels proposed by National Organizations Responding to AIDS (NORA),
which reflect documented community funding needs across the federal HIV /AIDS portfolio,
especially those programs impacting African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and
AsianlPacific Islanders.

Toward the goal of expanding access to promising new HIV therapies, the Council urges the
Administration to consider the critical need for full funding for the ADAP program, as well as for
primary medical care and other support services, including housing, which facilitate access to
such treatments.

Considering the goal of reducing the number of new infections, the Council further urges the
Administration to support efforts to provide substantial funding increases for prevention
programs

There is a state of emergency because of HIV/ AIDS in African-American and Latino
communities. Therefore, the Council urges the Administration's full support for meaningful and
sufficient funding levels for prevention and care initiatives targeting these communities.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

                       Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS


                                   Passed Recommendation


DISCRlMINA nON SUBCOMMITTEE:

     The President should work with Congress to create stronger protections for medical
     privacy, and should veto any legislation that 1) permits law enforcement authorities
     access to patient records without having obtained a warrant or meaningful and informed
     patient consent, or 2) fails to preserve the ability of the states to enact or maintain
     stronger privacy protections.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
          PACHA RESOLUTION ON NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS

                                           March 17, 1998


WHEREAS we the members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/ AIDS have on several
occasions advised the President and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala that the
Administration's current policy on needle exchange programs threatens the public health, and directly
contradicts current scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of such programs; and

WHEREAS this Administration has yet to put forward a coherent plan to increase access to substance
abuse treatment or to combat the spread of HIV among injection drug users and their partners; and

WHEREAS nearly 50% of all new HIV infections, and 44%, 44%, and 61 % of all reported AIDS cases
among African-Americans, Latinos, and women, respectively, are related to injection drug use; and

WHEREAS the Congress in 1997 reaffirmed Secretary Shalala's authority to make federal funds
available for needle exchange programs, provided that she first determine that needle exchange programs
reduce HIV transmission and do not encourage drug use; and

WHEREAS no fewer that six federally funded reports (including a 1997 Consensus Report prepared by
the National Institutes of Health) and numerous other scientific studies have concluded that the above
two criteria have been met; and

WHEREAS the nation's leading public health groups, including the American Medical Association, the
American Public Health Association, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Association of State
and Territorial Health Officers support needle exchange programs and the elimination of federal funding
restrictions; and

WHEREAS 61 % of Americans surveyed believe that decisions regarding the use of federal funds for
needle exchange programs should be made by local communities and not the federal government; and

WHEREAS it is essential that the nation's health policies be based on sound, scientific evidence rather
that on unsubstantiated fears or politics; and

WHEREAS in light of the disproportionate impact of injection drug-related HIV on communities of
color in the United States, the Secretary's continuing inaction undermines the credibility of the
Administration's stated goal of reducing racial and ethnic health disparities; therefore

BE IT RESOLVED that, in the interest of the public health, and in our capacity as independent advisors
to the Administration, we unanimously express "no confidence" in the Administration's commitment
and willingness to achieve the President's stated goal of "reducing the number of new infections
annually until there are no new infections"; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Council urges Secretary Shalala to issue an immediate
determination declaring the efficacy of needle exchange programs in preventing the spread of HIV while
not encouraging the use of illegal drugs.
                                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                       March 17, 1998
PRESIDENTIAL
           ADVIS RY
                              he Honorable William Jefferson Clinton
      COUNCIL



                              ear Mr. President,

                            When you told us at the White House Conference on HIV/AIDS in 1995 that
                             ou wanted to see our country "reduce the number of new infections each and
                            every year until there are no more new infections," we believed you. Thus, it is
                               ith great frustration and disappointment that we, the members of your
                              residential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, find it necessary to write this
                            letter to you. We must express, in the strongest terms possible, our profound
                            dismay regarding the lack of progress on the critical issue of removing the
                             rohibition on the use of federal funds for comprehensive needle exchange
                             rograms.

                              espite years of study and an overwhelming preponderance of scientific
                            evidence, no action has been forthcoming. All six federally funded reports, an
                              IH Consensus Conference report, and many other reputable studies have
                            concluded that needle exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and do not
                            encourage drug use. In light of this overwhelming evidence-as well as
                            support for needle exchange programs by the American Medical Association,
                             he American Public Health Association and numerous other public health
                            organizations across the country-the continuing delay by Secretary Shalala is
                            appalling.

                             ragically, we must conclude that it is a lack ofpoli~ical will, not scientific
                            evidence, that is creating this failure to act. This political treatment of a public
                             ealth issue is killing people; and it must cease.

                             ccording to studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, half
                            of the 40,000 annual new HIV infections in this country are transmitted through
                             eedle sharing. Thousands more are infected through sexual contact with
                             eedle users. Injection drug use also accounts for the overwhelming majority
                            of the pediatric AIDS cases in this country.

 It will be impossible to bring the epidemic to an end until you take decisive and effective action
 on this issue. Access to uncontaminated injection equipment, in conjunction with outreach,
 education, and referral and access to effective substance abuse treatment, is essential.

 Additionally, we have yet to see any other coherent strategies or initiatives by the Administration
 to deal with the rampaging HlV epidemic among injection drug users, their partners, and their
 children. We are left with the unfortunate conclusion that their lives are considered to be
 expendable by those with decision-making power within this Administration.

 Without action on this important matter, it is increasingly difficult to believe that your
 Administration is truly committed to ending new infections. As your advisors, we must tell you
 that this goal cannot be reached without action on this important item.

 Mr. President, where do you ,stand on this issue?

 We must further tell you that failure to act on this matter is destroying this Administration's
 credibility with people concerned about AIDS and is overshadowing the many other positive
 steps that have been made in combating this epidemic.

 When the history of the AIDS epidemic is finally written, we do not want your legacy to be one
 of having failed to take a necessary step at a critical time to save thousands of lives.

 We know that this issue is viewed by many as controversial. It is your leadership obligation to
 hear the varying viewpoints, weigh the scientific evidence, and make a Presidential decision on
 the matter. We fully believe that careful and honest consideration of the case on the merits can
 lead to only one conclusion: needle exchange programs decrease the transmission of HIV without
 encouraging drug use and, as such, are one important part of a continuum of activities to combat
 HlV .

. Secretary Shalala must issue an immediate determination that needle exchange programs meet
  the two-pronged test laid out in the law and must remove the restriction on the use of federal
  funds where desired by state and local officials.

In the nearly three years of the Council's existence, we have issued numerous recommendations
and letters on this issue, and there is tremendous impatience and anger in the community and
among Council members that nothing has happened. Every day that passes without action can
be measured in needless new infections, infections we know how to prevent. The time for study
and unwarranted delay is over. We urgently implore you and Secretary Shalala to act
immediately.

                       STATEMENT BY DR. SCOTT HITT
             CHAIR PRESIDENTIAL ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HIV/AIDS
                               March 17, 1998

Good morning. My name is Scott Hitt. I serve as Chair of the Council. In addition, I am a
practicing physician, and have cared for more than 1,000 patients with HIV disease.

During the 3 days that this Council will meet, dozens of people's lives will have been forever
changed because this Administration has failed to adopt a strategy that we know prevents HIV
infection. In the 14 months since the Secretary of the HHS spoke about this issue, thousands of
people have become infected as a result of injection drug use.

In December 1995, atthe White House Conference on HIV /AIDS, the President established a
goal of "reducing the number of new infections each and every year until there are no new
infections." He spoke eloquently and with obvious feeling about the devastating impact this
disease has had on the country. He spoke of personal friends lost to this epidemic and of
societalloss'as its consequence.

Thirteen months ago, the National Institutes of Health issued a consensus report which states,
and I quote, "An impressive body of evidence suggests powerful effects from needle exchange
programs. There is no longer doubt that these programs work, yet there is striking disjunction
between what science dictates and what policy delivers." In other words, the NIH panel said
needle exchange programs work.

A year ago, the President appointed Sandra Thurman as Director of the Office of National AIDS
Policy. In remarks made immediately following her appointment, Director Thurman was asked
by the press about needle exchange programs and declared her firm conviction, speaking for the
administration, that we should quote, "follow the science."

There is clear and convincing evidence that the scientific community has reached the conclusion
that needle exchange programs have a crucial role as part of a continuum of activities needed to
combat HIV infection. It is time that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as the chief
public health official of the country, clearly and vigorously tell the American people what the
scientists have told her: that needle exchange programs can prevent many new HIV infections.
 And, in answer to the question "does needle exchange promote drug use?"-- again, in the words
of the NIH Consensus Statement, "a preponderance of evidence shows either no change or
decreased drug use."

The American Medical Asociation, the American Public Health Assoc, National Acadamy of
Sciences and numerous other public health organizations across the country have added their
voices in support of such programs. The US Conference of Mayors, the American Bar
Association, as well as the Chairs of the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses, have urged
action in this area. This Council has repeatedly urged the Administration to act.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion



Our patience is exhausted. We are angry at the inexcusable inaction by Secretary Shalala on this
crucial issue affecting public health.

 The Council unanimously passed a resolution expressing "no confidence" in the
ADMINISTRATION'S commitment and willingness to achieve the PRESIDENT'S prevention
goal. Today we are sending a letter to the President outlining our frustrations.

Mr. President, the time for study and delay is over; the science is indisputable; and the time for
your action is now.
                                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

      COUNCIL
                                 arch 16, 1998


                                he Honorable Donna Shalala
                               Secretary
                               Department of Health and Human Services

                                 ashington, D.C.




                                   the leading public health official in the country, it is your responsibility to
                                xercise leadership on critical issues affecting the health of the nation. As the
                               Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/ AIDS, we urge you to demonstrate that
                                eadership on the issue of needle exchange programs in our common fight
                               against the transmission of HIV.

                                  you know, the statistics are compelling - injection drug use is directly
                               responsible for half of all new HIV infections in this country annually, and
                               indirectly responsible for the infection of thousands more people who are the
                                exual partners or children of infected users. HIV transmission related to needle
                                haring is, to a great extent, responsible for the frightening and disproportionate
                                pread of HIV among African-Americans and Latinos, particularly women.

                                  you also know, the scientific evidence of the efficacy of needle exchange
                               programs in preventing new infections is equally compelling, and there is no
                               credible evidence that needle exchange programs lead to increased drug use.

                                  e are, therefore, increasingly dismayed by your almost complete silence and
                               continued inaction. This critical health issue demands your leadership, not only
                               inside the government but also on a public level. Needle exchange programs
                               have powerful and vocal opponents. As the nation's leading spokesperson on
                                 ealth you must insure that science, not unsubstantiated fears, guides this
                               administration's policies.

80817th Street, NW, Suit 820   t is imperative that you state, publicly and unequivocally, what the scientific
       W"hington, DC )006      vidence demonstrates: needle exchange programs meet the two-pronged test
                               aid out in the law. By issuing such a determination you will send an important
                                 essage to the American people, and will help to change the terms of debate
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

 It is equally imperative that you immediately engage the President on this matter, by providing
 him with a full briefing on the scientific data and stressing the critical role needle exchange
 programs can play in reaching his stated goal of reducing the number of new HIV infections
 until there are none. We are hopeful that, presented with such compelling evidence and your
 strong advocacy, the President will immediately act in the interest qf public health and bring
 federal policy into line with current scientific knowledge.

  Lack of political will can no longer justify ignoring the science. Every day that goes by means
  more needless new infections and more human suffering. We call upon you to make an
  immediate determination and to allow the local use of federal funds for needle exchange
. programs as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention program. To do anything less would be an
  abdication of your responsibilities.

 Sincerely yours,

                           Denise Stokes Press Statement
                            Tuesday, March 17, 1998


In 1994, I sat a press conference as the Federal Government unveiled the America
Responds To AIDS (prevention) Campaign. Having appeared in two of those ads, I
shared the stage with The Secretary of Health, Donna Shalala. Her words that day
reached me very deeply - as a person living with HIV - and as a young person there
representing the future of America. She made such profound declarations. I sat and
listened to Secretary Shalala say, "Every new HIV infection is a needless infection. We
have the knowledge and the technology to prevent the ... spread of HIV. What we have
lacked until now is the political will - because we have been too timid to talk openly
about the prevention tools that are at your disposal."

Her words resounded in me and I understood them as being a promise made to me and
to the rest of the American people that no more lives would be squandered away because
of a lack of action from our government.

That was over 4 years ago ... and while people are dropping like flies, the Secretary still
refuses to do what really needs to be done.

Reputable scientific data clearly indicates that needle exchange programs prevent the
spread of HIV and do not encourage drug use. This is the technology '" these are the
prevention tools at our disposal. When will this administration truly take a leadership
role and exert this political will?

Real people - each with immeasurable value - have been neglected by this administration
and left to die. Politics should not regulate the value of human lives.

Having been hit the hardest by the intravenous transmission of HIV, Mrican American
and Latino communities are outraged. Black AIDS leaders have declared a state of
emergency because AIDS is killing us in such grossly disproportionate numbers. The
Secretary of Health has at her immediate disposal the ability to begin a process which will
save our lives.

Today, I am no longer speaking as the future of America ... I am now speaking for the
dead and for the dying... because that is what we have become. At the age of 29, I
have spent 16 years HIV positive. I have seen this disease gather momentum and
devastate my community ... our communities. On behalf of those most at risk for HIV,
I vehemently demand the right to life.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

                      Statement by Terje Anderson

                       PACHA Press Conference

                               March 17, 1998




My name is Terje Anderson, I am Executive Director of the Southern

Colorado AIDS Project located in Colorado Springs, and a member of the

Council. I am also a recovering injection heroin user.




As someone who knows first hand the damage that drugs did in my life, I

want to make clear that I am emphatically anti-drug and pro-treatment. We

are not advocating programs that encourage people to use drugs. Substance

abuse treatment and needle exchange programs are complementary parts of a

whole system of services that we need, services that can help people along the

path to recovery.




But I also know from personal experience that quitting is rarely easy. In my

own case, it took several years in and out of various treatment programs,

arrest, multiple emergency room visits and other traumas. But I finally did
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
quit - and I like to think my presence here is testament to that fact that.

recovery is possible, and that our lives our worth saving.


People do not begin usmg drugs because they have access to an

uncontaminated needle any more than easy access to wine glasses is the cause

of alcoholism or matches are the cause of teen smoking. It is not access to the

means of administration that makes someone start an addictive, destructive

behavior - it is much more complex, much deeper than that. Addiction is a

chronic, progressive disease, and incredibly complex human factors influence

who will and will not begin drug use.


There is a moral issue here, but not the one opponents of needle exchange

programs are focusing on. The question should be: "Do you care about the

lives of people like me? Are you willing to take steps - perhaps politically

risky or unpopular steps - in order to save lives? Or, instead, are you willing

to consider us expendable, disposable    people?"


People with addictions can recover, we do      recover. Please give us a chance

to recover without first becoming infected with life-threatening diseases.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

                               Achieving the Goal of an AIDS Vaccine


                                       Passed Recommendation


Background


       Approximately 40,000 people become infected with HIV in the USA each year;
worldwide, 6 million new infections occur annually.     Although behavioral change to reduce risk
of HIV infection is a viable strategy for some, it is clear that this strategy will not work for all.
Only a preventive vaccine will ultimately be successful in stopping the AIDS pandemic.
Commendably, President Clinton declared the goal, in May 1997, of a successful AIDS vaccine
within the next decade.    However, the current federal AIDS vaccine effort is stalled in paralyzing
scientific debate and bureaucratic delay.


       Since late 1995, the Research Committee of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV
and AIDS has devoted significant time and effort to issues concerning the development of an
AIDS vaccine.      The Committee consulted with numerous experts in AIDS research and
vaccinology (Appendix A), and also solicited and received written input from these and other
experts (Appendix B).


       The scientific issues involved in vaccine development are extremely complex and
controversial, and should be addressed by existing Federal agencies.      NIH has an essential role
to play in elucidating the basic scientific knowledge that underlies vaccine generation.     However,
this is only one aspect in the complete process of vaccine development.                     Additional
administrative and policy structures will also be required to address the myriad         public policy


                                                 1
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


issues which must also be resolved, both nationally and internationally to expedite development
of a successful AIDS vaccine.         These issues include development and implementation of
mechanisms to assure the active participation and coordination of all relevant agencies of the US
government, as well as the pharmaceutical industry and the international community, where
candidate vaccines must be tested for efficacy, and where the need for an effective vaccine is the
greatest.    The recommendations which follow concern these administrative issues, which must
be planned and coordinated simultaneously with the actual generation of candidate vaccines.


        Requisite participants in vaccine development


        Federal agencies:    The proposed restructuring of the AIDS vaccine program within NIH
represents an important     step in expanding   the scientific leadership which will be necessary to
expedite the development of candidate vaccines.         The appointment of Dr. David Baltimore as
Chair of the AIDS Vaccine Research Committee (AVRC), the expanded vaccine budget, and the
proposed      institution of a new   Vaccine Research      Laboratory at the NIH, can        all serve to
invigorate the scientific process.     The appointment of a full-time Director of the Vaccine
. Research Lab could provide another mechanism for coordination of the vaccine development
effort within NIH.      However, the Council is very concerned that recent progress has been
slowed substantially by the failure to appoint this individual, who must be at the highest level of
expertise.


        In addition to NIH, Federal agenCIes such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), Department of Defense (DOD), and the United States Agency. for
International Development (USAID) have among them extensive experience                 and expertise in
the area of vaccine development, field epidemiology, surveillance, and the conduct of vaccine
efficacy trials, especially in developing countries. It would thus seem prudent to ensure the active
cooperation,     collaboration and communication of       all relevant federal agencies in the areas of


                                                  2
                                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion


candidate vaCCIne development and testing, if the President=s goal is to be met.                      Similar
recommendations were made by the Levine Commission.                     However,          although various
NIH vaccine meetings have been attended by DOD and CDC representatives,                       and although
an informal interagency group was formed, this group does not include senior leadership, and
has not met on a regular basis.             Thus, it is clear that    no formal process of interagency
coordination has       been developed or implemented.           If the President=s goal is to be met, such
interagency communication and coordination must occur, involving the highest levels of
leadership from each agency.


              Pharmaceutical and biotechnology         industries:   It is clear that development of a
successful AIDS vaccine will also require          the active   involvement of the     pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries,         working    in a coordinated manner with relevant federal agencies.
The pharmaceutical industry traditionally has been a major leader                    in the creation and
development of vaccines, and should be encouraged to participate actively in the pursuit of an
AIDS vaccine.          Further,    eventual product development will require the infrastructure and
expertise which reside primarily within the private sector of pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries.      To ensure the requisite coordination of both public and private sectors, an
administrative mechanism must be created.          Multiple policy issues must also be addressed, in an
attempt to overcome existing finanCial disincentives for involvement by the private sector.              This
may entail subsidies for targeted applied research, cooperative agreements for pilot manufacture
of vacCine approaches not commerCially attractive, support of phase III human efficacy trials, tax
rebates,      and/or patent extensions.     Federal leadership will also be needed to address related
issues, such as intellectual property rights, liability, and international vaccine development and
purchase funds.


           International community:       Due to the higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS in developing
nations,      the majority of clinical testing   for   efficacy of candidate vaccines (Phase III)       must


                                                       3

                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

be accomplished internationally.    Further, the majority of AIDS vaccine use is expected to occur
in nations outside the USA.      It is thus apparent that mechanisms to develop true partnerships
between the international community and the federal AIDS vaccine effort must begin at once,
with   exchange of      information and   full coordination of combined    efforts.    Agencies such
as the United Nations Program on AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Bank, the International AIDS
Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), and the leading developed     countries (G-8), as well as those countries
most affected,    have critical roles to play in the final testing and implementation of an AIDS
vaccme.     A mechanism must be developed to provide a means for ongoing communication and
collaboration among these groups, as well as         the other critical constituencies listed above.
Critical issues which must be addressed by these groups include active involvement in the process
by scientists living in the countries involved, assurance of scientifically and ethically appropriate
field testing of candidate vaccines, and mechanisms to ensure access to        vaccine product after
successful field testing.


Leadership and coordination


          Role of the President=s Office:     It is only within the Office of the President that
sufficient authority exists to ensure leadership, through coordination and collaboration of all
requisite constituencies, including Federal agencies, private sector, and the international
community. Responsibility for this effort should rest with the Office of National AIDS Policy
(ONAP). The Council, therefore, recommends that the President formally charge the Director of
ONAP with developing and maintaining administrative mechanisms for accomplishing the
requisite communication and coordination among all relevant parties, including assurance of
the involvement of senior leadership from all constituencies.         Adequate resources must be
made available for this function.


          Generation of a Comprehensive Federal Plan for AIDS Vaccine Development:                   A
Comprehensive Federal AIDS Vaccine Plan must be developed and implemented. This plan


                                                 4
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
must include the vision and process for vaccine development, and must also depict the specific
objectives, responsibilities, strategies and outcomes for the implementation of the plan.
Additional requisites of the plan should include the framework by which competing issues may
be addressed, an overall work schedule, and a specific time-frame in which certain milestones are
to be accomplished. The Council recommends that the process for development of this plan be
organized within the Office of National AIDS Policy, working with relevant federal agencies.


Moving candidate vaccines into human trials


       Differences of opinion on the appropriate time for bringing AIDS vaccine strategies into
human efficacy trials result from two divergent philosophical approaches. The "basic science"
approach pursues knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms of retroviral disease and
immunity in animal models and limited human studies, in order to elucidate the protective
immune response. Candidate vaccines are then designed to induce those specific responses, and
only then do human efficacy trials proceed. The "empirical science" approach brings vaccines
into human trials relatively earlier, if comparable vaccines were. safe and effective in animals,
even without a clear understanding of their biological mechanisms of action. This has been the
case for many existing vaccines in current use. With the gravity of the current AIDS pandemic
in the world, and the need to proceed with vaccine development as quickly as possible, the
Council acknowledges that it will be necessary to test various traditional and novel vaccine
design strategies in human clinical trials, even before the scientific correlates of protection have .
been fully deciphered. We thus advocate the simultaneous implementation of both basic and
empiric scientific approaches.    These parallel approaches should. be recognized within the
comprehensive Federal plan for AIDS vaccine development.


Summary of Recommendations:



1.     Substantive involvement, coordination, and collaboration among all relevant federal



                                                 5
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

     agencies, the private sector, and the international community are critical to the

     development of an effective AIDS vaccine;



2.   Federal leadership at the highest level will be required, through the Office of National

     AIDS Policy, ensuring that adequate resources are provided for the coordination process

     necessary to achieve the goal of an effective AIDS vaccine.



3.   The Office of National AIDS Policy should ensure the development and implementation

     of a comprehensive federal plan to achieve the goal of an effective AIDS vaccine.



4.   The process of defining the structure and mission of the proposed (AIDS) Vaccine Center

     at NIH, and the appointment of a director with the highest level of expertise, should

     proceed promptly.



5.   The urgent need for an AIDS vaccine mandates the simultaneous implementation of both

     basic and empiric scientific approaches.
