,Subject:         Agenda for November 19 Meeting of President's Advisory Board on
 Race



 I am sorry that we were not able to touch base today. Attached for your
 consideration is a draft memorandum concerning the November 19 meeting of
 the President's Advisory Board on Race. As you may know, the meeting will
 focus primarily on the value of diversity in higher education. The
 attached memo outlines possible messages that we intend will emerge from
 the meeting, a proposed agenda for the meeting, possible presenters, and
 other ideas.  I would greatly appreciate your input. As we discussed, our
 hope and intention is to coordinate efforts with the DPC.

 I realize that this is short notice, but I would like to invite you to a
 meeting at the Initiative's offices tomorrow, Tuesday, November 4, at 3:30
 p.m. to discuss the attached document and the Advisory Board's agenda. We
 will be joined by staff from the Department of Education.  In the
 alternative or in addition, I would like to meet with you at your
 convenience to discuss the attached document and to discuss other larger
 ways in which our efforts and those of the Advisory Board concerning the
 value of diversity in higher education (and other education issues) can
 best complement your work.

 I hope all is well, and I look forward to talking with you soon.

SUBJECT:      Proposed Messages and Agenda for November 19 Advisory Board Meeting

DATE:November 3,1997

       The November 19 Advisory Board meeting will focus primarily on the value of diversity
in higher education. The Board will also discuss the continuing vestiges of discrimination in
various sectors. This memorandum expands on those two topics. It presents suggested
messages that we intend will emerge from the Advisory Board meeting, a proposed agenda for
the meeting, possible presenters, and other ideas for your consideration. We welcome
comments from all staff, especially concerning possible presenters for the meeting. As you
know, we are working under a very tight schedule. (A time line of preparation activities is
attached for your consideration.) Judy has scheduled a meeting for Tuesday, November 4 at
3:30 p.m. to discuss this document. Please feel free to attend. Otherwise, please provide any
comments or ideas to Scott as soon as possible.

1.      Messages to Emerge From Advisory Board Meeting

        A.    Primary Message: "The Value of Diversity in Higher Education"

        Colleges and universities that promote diversity can greatly contribute to improving race
relations in the 21st Century.
        Minority participation in higher education has increased dramatically in the last
several decades. Studies indicate that this increased racial diversity can yield substantial
educational benefits for all students. By bringing together students of different
backgrounds, colleges and universities are teaching students critical lessons about how to
live and work together, and they are exposing students to new perspectives that enrich the
learning environment. Increased minority participation in higher education can also help

                                                1
                                                             Hex-Dump Conve~J:lJ}
overcome racial disparities in society by providing quality education to tradItionally

undese;:e:r::;~:,Q~~~~~J,'~~l:!u~~~~Yo
change. There are many colleges and universities across America that have developed and
are continuing to develop policies and programs that can foster these benefits of diversity.
At its November 19 meeting, the Advisory Board will discuss the value of diversity in
higher education and will identify existing programs, policies, and partnerships that are
promoting the value of diversity on campuses across America.

       B.      Secondary Message: "Continuing Discrimination and Civil Rights
               Enforcement"

         While America has made great progress in race relations, racial discrimination stifl
exists in various sectors of society, and it manifests itself in ways that are sometimes blatant
but more often subtle and hard to detect. Enhanced enforcement of existing civil rights laws
can help eliminate these continuing vestiges of discrimination. [We want to call to your
attention to the fact that our current proposal has no panelists for this Secondary Agenda Item.
Our vision is that this issue could be tackled at the beginning of the meeting with reference to a
prior prepared report and some brief comments and discussion by the Board.]

II.    Agenda (including suggested panels and presenters)

8:00 am                Doors open

                       enforcement.

                     .programs to promote diversity in higher education.

3:00 pm - 3:30 pm     Press availability

III.   Details of Other Ideas

      We recommend asking other college/university presidents, beyond those participating, to
       provide supporting essays to the Advisory Board concerning the value of diversity in
       higher education. Most presidents, if not all, have already written such pieces. TIlls
       will provide a sense of national support behind the presidents who are speaking.

      Ifpossible, we recommend that invited guests (i.e., members of the Cabinet) sit in with
       the Advisory Board at each meeting to promote involvement in the Initiative. The
       logical guest for the November meeting is Secretary Riley. Having Secretary Riley in
       attendance will increase public and media attention on the event and make policy and
       other follow up opportunities more achievable.

      We recommend that the meeting be more interactive by having a working lunch with
       invited attendees. Our vision is that each Advisory Board member will anchor a table
       along with presenters, students, faculty, and staff and discuss concrete questions that we
       provide, such as "The Campus Environment: What are colleges doing right to foster an
       appropriate environment for positive cross-racial interactions? What could be
       improved?" After lunch, one participant from each table (or each Advisory Board
       member) would report back to the Board and the audience with a list of responses to each
       question. (This idea is modeled from a recent event in Fairfax County.)

      We want to call your attention to the fact that our current proposal has no panelist(s) for
       the demographic issue concerning the present state of diversity on college campuses.
       We felt that this information could be provided to the Board, press, and others in
       supporting materials, and could be covered at the Board meeting within the comments of
       those panelists speaking on the value of diversity in higher education.
