                  NEW CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES
                             DRAFT, January 19, 1998

        The Vice President today announced a package of civil rights enforcement initiatives that
places new emphasis on prevention and non-litigation remedies for discrimination while
simultaneously strengthening civil rights agencies' ability to enforce anti-discrimination law. The
plan promotes prevention by providing increased resources for compliance reviews and technical
assistance, and offers an alternative to expensive litigation by funding a dramatic expansion of
alternate dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms. The plan also sets specific performance goals
for the EEOC to speed processing of complaints and reduce case backlog, and proviqes for
greater coordination across federal agencies and offices. The Clinton Administration's Fiscal
Year 1999 Budget contains $602 million for civil rights enforcement agencies, $86 million or 14
percent more than enacted in last year's budget.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
        The centerpiece of the EEOC budget proposal is an expansion of the ADR program that
will double the number of complaints eligible for ADR in 1999 to 16,000 cases, or 20 percent of
incoming cases. The Administration plan seeks to expand ADR over the next three years with the
goal of providing a voluntary option for ADR in all eligible cases for employers and employees
who choose it. The Administration's 1999 Budget sets specific performance goals for the
EEOC to reduce its backlog. Through a combination of improved information technology,
increased use of mediation, and more investigators, the EEOC will reduce the average time it
takes to resolve private sector complaints from over 9.4 months to 6 months by the year 2000.
The budget also allocates $10 million for information technology to enhance inter-office
communication, eliminate redundant data entry procedures, and provide for greater operational
efficiency through the sharing of information. Overall the budget requests $279 million for the
EEOC, or 15 percent more than the enacted 1998 budget.

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
        The Administration's budget proposes an increased emphasis on reducing
discrimination and ensuring equal opportunity in housing. The highlight of the HUD budget
proposal is a targeted, audit-based enforcement initiative in 20 areas nationwide that would use
paired testing, in which otherwise identical applicants of different races approach realtors or
landlords, in order to detect and eliminate housing discrimination. The Administration proposal
also seeks $23 million, or an $8 million increase, for the Fair Housing Assistance Program, to
support the creation of additional State and local housing organizations to meet the needs of
currently under served populations and to aid joint investigations and enforcement activities.

Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division
      The President's 1999 budget contains resources to expand investigation of police
misconduct, violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and provides special funding to
enhance the coordination of Federal civil rights enforcement among all the I:ederal civil rights



                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
the overall civil rights agenda of the Administration in promoting consistent rules in enforcing
civil rights laws, and expanding the Administration's ability to provide technical assistance by
removing duplicative efforts.

Other Civil Rights Agencies and Offices

       Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).
        The Administration's budget will enable OFCCP to increase by 10 percent the number of
compliance reviews conducted. In addition, OFCCP will modernize its computer systems in
order to permit the agency to accept electronically submitted reports from contractors.

        U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
         The President's budget increases emphasis on outreach to under-represented customers,
involvement of small and disadvantaged businesses in USDA programs, conflict resolution
activities, and processing complaints brought by employees and customers. The proposal
increases funding for USDA's civil rights programs from $15 million to $19 million.

       The Department of Labor, Office of Civil Rights
        The President's budget maintains the current funding with the goal of promoting
voluntary compliance with existing non-discrimination laws through education and technical
assistance and encouraging States to promote the use of alternate dispute resolution.

       Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights
        The President's budget provides an increase in funds for the Office allowing it, among
other activities, to focus on preventing discrimination through building partnerships with States
to address statewide compliance with civil rights laws.

       Department of Health and Human Services (HSS), Office of Civil Rights
        The Administration budget continues a focus on compliance reviews and technical
assistance to ensure that persons do not encounter discrimination in HAS programs. These
include areas of managed care, inter-ethnic adoption, limited English proficient services, and
welfare reform.




                                                2
        The Administration budget increases funds to reduce case back-logs and address new
complaints.


       U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
       The President's budget includes $11 million for the Commission in order to carry out its
mission in conducting investigations, educating the public on civil rights matters, and operating
programs that address both local and national civil rights interests and concerns.
