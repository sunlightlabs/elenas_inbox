                    ENDING BUSINESS AS USUAL IN WASHINGTON
                             A Strong Record of Reform


      "The fact is, organized interests have too much power in the halls ofgovernment. These
influence groups too often promote their own interest at the expense of the public interest. Too
often they operate in secret. Too often they have special privileges ordinary Americans don't
even know exist.... We have an historic opportunity to renew our democracy and strengthen our
country. If we truly believe in a government that puts ordinary Americans ahead of the
powerful and privileged, then we must act and act now. "

                                  President Bill Clinton
                                  February 17, 1996

A Record of Accomplishment:

       Time and again, President Clinton has exhibited his commitment to curbing the influence
of special interests and money in our political system. Since entering office President Clinton
has pursued a far-reaching agenda of political reform. The President is committed to reforming
the way Washington works and ending business as usual. Among his accomplishments, he has:

      Made voting easier for more than 11 million Americans by creating more accessible
       voter registration locations by enacting the National Voter Registration Act
       ("Motor-Voter"). The Motor-Voter law has already created the greatest expansion in
       the voter registration rolls since the 19th century.

      Fought for and signed into law the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The Act is the first
       overhaul of lobbying rules in 50 years and requires lobbyists to disclose who they work
       for and eliminates loopholes that allow lobbying organizations to avoid

      Gift ban. In the 1995 State-of-the-Union Address, President Clinton challenged the
       Congress to ban gifts, meals, travel and entertainment from lobbyists. The Congress
       subsequently passed the ban on November 16th, 1995.

      Enacted the Congressional Accountability Act to ensure that the same laws apply to
       Congress as to the rest of America.

      Closing the "lobbyist loophole." In 1993, President Clinton proposed, and Congress
       passed, legislation ending the tax-deductibility oflobbying expenses, which had allowed
       corporations and others to deduct the cost oftheir lobbying.

      Imposed the strictest Administration ethics guidelines ever, including a five-year ban

                            Hex-Dump Conversion


            on top officials lobbying their former agencies and a lifetime ban against lobbying for
            foreign governments.
           Enacted line-item veto legislation which significantly enhances the presidential authority
            to eliminate wasteful spending by allowing the President to cancel wasteful special
            interest projects and targeted tax breaks that benefit special interests. The line-item veto
            can help the President close the door on business as usual in Washington by ending
            breaks for special interests and cutting pet spending projects that sneak into the budget
            year after year. With this line-item veto, the President will have a valuable new tool to
            ensure that our public resources are being put to the best possible uses.

           Enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to restrict Congress from passing on
            new mandates to state and local governments without paying for them.

           Special Interests. President Clinton has stood up to special interests, such as the
            National Riffle Association and the tobacco industry, loosening their tight hold on our
            legislative process. The President broke six years of congressional gridlock and defeated
            the gun lobby by enacting a ban on assault weapons and the Brady Law.


     A History Of Fighting For Real Campaign Finance Reform

     1992          Campaign Finance Reform Proposal. In the 1992 campaign, Governor Clinton
                   proposed spending limits, free TV time, PAC limits and a ban on soft money.
                   The current McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan legislation mirrors this
                   proposal.

     1993-1994     Campaign Finance Reform Plan. The President and the congressional
                   Democratic leadership proposed a reform plan that also included partial public
                   funding for congressional candidates. Reform groups praised the President for
                   his support of the plan. Unfortunately, the legislation was filibustered, despite
                   passage in bo~h chambers.

     1995          Bipartisan CFR Commission. In June of 1995, the President agreed with
                   Speaker Gingrich to create a bipartisan political reform commission. The
                   President named John Gardner and Doris Kearns Goodwin to launch the
                   commission, but they were rebuffed by the Speaker.

     1996 - 1997   McCain-Feingold/Sbays-Meeban.            In the 1996 State-of-the-Union, the
                   President announced his support of the bipartisan bill. He repeated his support
                   throughout 1996. In the 1997 State-of-the-Union Address the President
                   challenged Congress to pass this legislation by July 4th, 1997. On January 11,
                   1997 the President met with the bipartisan co-sponsors of the House legislation
                   (Shays-Meehan), reiterating his belief that delay will mean the death of reform.
