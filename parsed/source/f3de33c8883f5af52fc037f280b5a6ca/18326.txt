TEXT:
On 12/29, we sent to you the attached note seeking input on several
sensitive L/HHS General Provision issues that we need to address to
complete and print the FY 1999 President's Budget. We really need to hear


from each of you by tomorrow (1/9) in order to meet the Budget print
schedules. My main concern is that there may be differing views on some
of these (e.g., Needle Exchange) and follow-up discussions may be
necessary.  If so, they would have to occur as early next week as possible.

We also sent to you yesterday morning an e-mail on the treatment of
abortion provisions throughout the Budget. As requested yesterday, we'd
appreciate hearing from you on these by tomorrow as well.

Subject: Needles/Embryos/Abortion and Other Selected L/HHS General
Provisions

Josh Gotbaum does not have access to his e-mail system this morning and
has asked me to forward this note to all of you for him.

Attached is a table of selected Labor/HHS General Provisions related to
health that will require policy decisions in order to print the FY 1999
Budget Appendix.  Traditionally, the Budget shows the prior year's (i.e.,
FY 1998 enacted) appropriations language, and brackets language proposed
for deletion, and italicizes any new or revised language.

Due to the FY 1999 Budget print schedule, we are requesting your
views/comments on these General Provisions by January 5.  Please let us
know by then whether or not you agree with the recommendations in the
attached file, or if you think we need to meet on any of these issues.

The file to the right shows:

1. The FY 1997 enacted language.

2. Our proposed language in the FY 1998 Budget.

3. The FY 1998 enacted language.

4. OMB staff and HHS (where available) recommendations for the FY 1999
Budget.

The provisions we've included are:

1. Needle Exchange - Probably the stickiest issue this year.  It will
require extensive consultation within the Administration.  Detailed
background on this issue is included below.

2. Human Embryos/cloning - The recommendation would repeat the FY 1998


Budget policy of deleting the language with a footnote saying we don't
recommend addressing this issue in legislation.  However, the world of
cloning has changed in the past year, and we may need to rethink our
position.  Detailed background on this issue is also included below.

3. Abortion/Hyde Amendment - We would repeat the FY 1998 Budget policy of
deleting the language with a footnote saying we'll work with Congress to
address the issue. Note that while the FY 1998 enacted language was more
expansive than in past years, we would still recommend returning to the FY
1998 Budget policy.

4. Family Planning - We would repeat the FY 1998 enacted language.

5. Limitation of the use of funds for promotion of controlled substances -
We would repeat the FY 1998 enacted language, which is the same as was
proposed in the FY 1998 Budget.


CLICK ON THE SECTIONS BELOW FOR BACKGROUND ON NEEDLES AND CLONING


NEEDLE EXCHANGE

Statutory Restrictions on the Use of Federal Funds for NEPs:

Since 1988, US Appropriations or Authorization law has placed a
conditional prohibition on the use of Federal funds for the operation of
needle exchange programs.

Currently, there are three statutory restrictions on the use of Federal
funds for the operation of needle exchange programs:

The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA)
Reorganization Act of 1992, prohibits the use of Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration Block grant funds for needle
exchange programs unless the Surgeon General determines that they are
effective in reducing the spread of HIV and the use of illegal drugs. The
statute does, however, allow Federal research and evaluation of existing
needle exchange programs.

Section 422 of the 1996 Ryan White CARE Act reauthorization places a flat
prohibition on the use of Ryan White funds for needle exchange.

Sections 505 & 506 of the FY 1998 L/HHS / Ed Appropriations bill read:

505: Not withstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds
appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out any program of
distributing sterile needles or syringes for the hypodermic injection of
any illegal drug.

506:   Section 505 is subject to the condition that after March 31, 1998, a
program for exchanging such needles and syringes (referred to in this
section as an "exchange project") may be carried out in a community if (1)
the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that exchange
projects are effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not
encourage the use of illegal drugs; and (2) the project is operated in
accordance with criteria established by such Secretary for preventing the
spread of HIV and for ensuring that the project does not encourage the use
of illegal drugs.


This limitation has been in Labor/ H appropriations language in some form
since 1990.  In the FY 1998 Appropriations bill, the Appropriators split
the provision into two provisions and added the six-month moratorium on
certification and the language requiring that the exchange programs must
be operated in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary.

In the past, the Administration has worked to avoid an outright ban on the
use of Federal funds for NEPs (like the current Section 505) and maintain
the authority of the Secretary to certify that Federal funds can be used
for such programs.

RECOMMENDATION:

There have been several studies done on the efficacy of NEPs in recent
years, and there is current data available to meet the first requirement
in this language (e.g. that NEPs are successful in preventing the spread
of HIV) , but HHS maintains that the data on the second provision (that
NEPs do not encourage the use of illegal drugs) is still inconclusive.
HHS is expecting the results of additional studies on NEPs in the coming
year and wants to maintain the Secretary's authority to continue to
evaluate the evolving scientific data on this issue and to certify that
Federal funds can be used for NEPs.

To maintain maximum flexibility for the Secretary, we recommend bracketing
(deleting) Section 506 and modifying Section 505 by re-proposing the
language that was proposed in the FY 1998 Budget on this issue:

505: Not withstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds
appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out any program of
distributing sterile needles or syringes for the hypodermic injection of
any illegal drug unless the Surgeon General determines that such programs
are effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use
of illegal drugs.

[Note: The words "or syringes" were added in FY 1998 enacted language --
they were not proposed in the 98 Budget.  Our recommendation would repeat
"or syringes" in the FY 1999 Budget.J

ALTERNATE RECOMMENDATION:

In addition to bracketing section 506, we could add a footnote similar to
that placed on the Hyde language deletions: The Administration proposes
to delete this provision and will work with Congress to address this issue.

Also, rather than repeat the language in the FY 1998 Budget that gave the
authority to certify NEPs to the Surgeon General to the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, we could maintain the language that was made by
Congress in the FY 1997 Labor/HHS/Ed Appropriations bill that gave such
authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.   This may be
something the Administration wants to consider given the upcoming
confirmation hearings for Surgeon General nominee David Satcher.



Background on Human Embryos/Cloning

Both the House and Senate L/HHS bills for FY 1998 extended the FY 1996 and
FY 1997 appropriations Act ban on using Federal funds on human embryo
research, and modified it to include research involving "human diploid
cells." NIH staff advise that in practice, this extension does not differ


from the original ban on human embryo research and would have no effect on
NIH's present research efforts.  The words "human diploid cells" were
apparently added in an attempt to address cloning.

A diploid cell is produced after fertilization occurs in humans -- it is
one stage of a developing embryo.  Diploid cells could theoretically be
produced via somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is more commonly
referred to as "cloning." The FY 1996 and FY 1997 L/HHS Acts barred
Federal funding for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or
performing research on human embryos that subjects them to significant
risk. The prohibition on creating embryos for research purposes would, de
facto, prohibit creating a human embryo through cloning technology.  This
is why including diploid cells in the embryo research ban does not differ
practically from banning the creation of human embryos.

The FY 1998 Budget proposed to delete the embryo research ban, stating
that the Administration "does not support addressing this issue in
legislation."  In December 1994, the President had issued a statement
barring the use of Federal funds for creating human embryos for research
purposes.  On June 9, 1997, the President announced that he was sending
proposed legislation to the Congress, the "Cloning Prohibition Act of
1997," which would prohibit any attempt to create a human being using
somatic cell nuclear transfer.  The Administration did not oppose the
language in the FY 1998 bill in its letters or SAP's.

Observations:  Last year's budget's proposal to delete this provision came
before the cloning debate of last spring (e.g., Dolly).

Given the President's proposed legislation on prohibiting cloning, and the
fact that SAP's did not oppose the language during the FY 1998
appropriations process, the Administration may not want to bracket the
language again, even with the footnote that says the Administration does
not support addressing this issue in legislation.
