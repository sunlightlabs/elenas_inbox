 H.R. 2086 - Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act of 1996
 (Shays (R) CT and 7 cosponsors)
 The Administration has repeatedly endorsed ?local flexibility?
 legislation, subject to key changes that were provided to the
 Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. The Committee has
 rejected the Administration?s proposed changes.  Instead, it has
 shifted the focus of H.R. 2086 from flexibility in coordinating
 funding and program operations to an attempt to unravel existing'
 regulatory protections and procedures. As reported, the bill
 would make many fundamental statutes, including important health,
 safety, labor, educational, environmental, and civil rights
 protections, subject to waivers.
 Therefore, if H.R. 2086 were presented to the President in the


form reported by the Committee, the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
would recommend that the bill be vetoed. The Administration?s
objections to H.R. 2086 are explained further in the Attachment.
The Administration firmly believes in providing greater
flexibility to State and local governments for the purpose of
encouraging innovation and efficiency. The Oregon Option, the
Memorandum of Understanding with the State of Connecticut, 59
welfare waivers, 12 Medicaid waivers, over 100 ?Ed-Flex?
education waivers, and the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise
Community programs underscore the Administration?s active, strong
commitment to local empowerment and flexibility.  The President?s
FY 1997 Budget also supported the Local Empowerment and
Flexibility Act, with the key changes that were rejected by the
Committee.

Administration Objections to H.R. 2086
The Administration has major concerns with several provisions in
the bill, including:
1.       Exclusions -- H.R. 2086 makes many fundamental statutes
subject to waiver and allows standard-less alternative
measures to supplant important statutory protections. These
would include, among others, laws that preserve the
environment, protect workers and their pensions, ensure the
health and safety of Americans, provide for Federal
financial accountability, safeguard certain civil and
constitutional rights, and enforce the constitutional rights
of disabled students under the Equal Protection Clause of
the 14th Amendment and ensure the nondiscriminatory
treatment of those students. The Administration continues
to believe that because of their significance, these
statutes should not be subject to waiver.    In addition, the
Administration continues to support waivers for only those
programs that provide Federal financial assistance, as was
stated in the purposes section of the original legislation
that was first considered by the last Congress and
reintroduced in the Senate by Senator Hatfield as S.88.    The
list of exclusions, which the Administration provided to the
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, must be
included in the final legislation. The Administration
strongly opposes H.R. 2086 because it would allow for the
waiver of these vital statutes and the protections they
provide.
The complex procedure contained in H.R. 2086 for the
replacement of regulations with alternative measures will
undercut the bill?s fundamental purpose of facilitating
program operations. The amount of review required to waive
regulations not directly related to program operations would
add considerable time to the approval process of local
flexibility plans.   For example,         [OIRA please fill in
an appropriate example] .
2.       Community Empowerment Board (CEB) -- The bill makes the CEB
a ?superagency.? It vests authority in the CEB to approve
or revoke waivers and approve or terminate plans, rather
than the "affected Federal agencies" as proposed by the
Administration. The bill also provides that the CEB -- not


the affected Federal agencies -- enter into a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with the applicant. These changes
create problems in the administration of Federal programs,
because the agencies and not the CEB have the legal

responsibility and authority for administering grants, can
ensure program requirements are met, and have the necessary
program expertise and knowledge.   In addition, the bill
gives the CEB, not the agencies, the lead in setting a wide
range of policies. The Administration opposes creating a
new bureaucracy to approve· the waiver requests.  In
addition, the Administration strongly supports placing
control over the waiver process with the respective
agencies, with the CEB playing a coordinating role.
3.      Fungibility of Funds/Audit and Accountability Issues -- H.R.
2086 appears to allow broad fungibility of Federal grant
funds and provides insufficient financial management and
performance accountability. The Administration only
supports waivers if ?the plan will more effectively achieve
the general goals of each Federal financial assistance
program.? H.R. 2086 would permit approval of local plans
that commingle funds from several Federal agencies that, by
statute, support activities different from those to be
carried out under the Local Flexibility Plan. Moreover, the
extent of the fungibility of Federal funds implied by the
bill raises significant legal and financial accountability
issues for Federal agencies responsible for managing these
grant programs. The bill should not permit waiver of
financial management and audit requirements that enable
agencies to account for Federal funds to authorizing and
appropriating committees of the Congress. Thus, the bill
should prohibit waiver of the Single Audit Act of 1984 and
not prevent the application of routine grants management
accountability safeguards and cost principles.
4.      Waiver of Local Matching Requirements -- Because H.R. 2086
is silent whether Federal requirements for local matching
grants may be waived for Local Flexibility plans, it thus
would permit such waivers. The Administration?s proposal
would specifically prohibit such waivers and the
Administration strongly recommends the addition of such a
prohibition. From a policy perspective, a local share
requirement not only provides more resources, but also
invests the community seeking Federal grant funds with
greater commitment to and stake in the project or activity.
The Administration also believes that the availability of
such a waiver authority is likely to dramatically distort
the flow of applications the CEB receives.   Many State and
local governments are strapped for resources and would.be
hard pressed to resist pressures to seek waivers from the
CEB every year of all local matching requirements.
5.      Application for funds and normal State role. The bill would
substitute the flexibility plan for a normal application for

funding and negate any other application requirement --
including, it appears, any requirements that an applicant be
a State, a school district, etc.   In many programs, the
Federal Government has a relationship only with a State.
Under H.R. 2086, local governments might seek to bypass the
State and obtain funds directly from the Federal Government.
In addition, this provision would substantially increase the


  complexity of flexibility proposals, and bog down the review
  process. Plans would have to include information needed to
  determine the allocation of funds.  For competitive grants,
  there would have to be sufficient detail to compare the
  flexibility plan to other proposals. Thus, while the
  Administration strongly believes in, and is working toward a
  streamlined and one-stop application process where feasible,
  formal application for and allocation of funds must be kept
  separate from the flexibility process.  Further, it is not
  appropriate to by-pass the role of State governments and
  other partners who must remain involved in intergovernmental
  service delivery.
