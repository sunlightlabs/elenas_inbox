 MEMORANDUM FOR                 ERSKINE BOWLES

 FROM:                          GENE SPERLING
                                BRUCE REED

 SUBJECT:                       "Choice" No-Fault Auto Insurance

 Both you and the President independently asked us to look into whether the "choice" no-fault
 auto insurance plan devised by Jeffrey O'Connell and Michael Horowitz, supported by Senator
 Dole in last year's election, and now proposed for implementation in New Jersey by Governor
 Whitman might be something we would think a good idea as a matter of policy. Our
 preliminary response is that the Administration should not reject the plan out of hand -- it has
 positive features, including some that go beyond auto insurance premium reduction, that suggest
 a closer policy look is appropriate. During the 1970s, the Carter Administration supported
 national no-fault. There is still staff at Commerce and DOT who were part of that effort and
 have some expertise in the field. Before deciding to pursue any form of no-fault, we should
 bring these agencies into the process.

  One preliminary question is what "support" for a "choice" no-fault plan might mean. It could be
, as little as using the bully pulpit to say this is a good idea and states should look into it. Or as
  much as supporting federal legislation to require states to adopt choice plans. A lesser
  alternative would be to provide federal incentives, such as increased highway safety or medicare
  funds, for states that adopt choice plans (presumably ones that meet certain statutory stantards).
  Simply authorizing states to adopt such plans is a legally meaningless act, since they can do so
  already. These degrees of support implicate issues of federal preemption of state tort law as well
  as questions related purely to no-fault.

 What is no-fault?

 No-fault auto insurance is essentially first party coverage: if you're injured in an auto accident,
 your carrier pays for your injuries l and your right to sue the other party (if there is one) is either
 non-existent ("pure" no-fault) or circumscribed. Almost all no-fault policies get their savings
 from the fact that only economic damages are covered -- no pain and suffering. No state has
 pure no fault. Depending on how you count, about 13 states and Puerto Rico have some form of
 no-fault. In New York and Michigan, which require extremely serious and objectively verifiable


         1 Much auto property damage (to the auto) is covered by collision insurance. Some
 states have experimented with broader no-fault for property damage, but it was neither very
 effective nor very efficient. It is generally not an issue in the debate.

injuries to get into court, it is reasonably effective in holding down costs and keeping cases out of
court (although New York premiums are high for other reasons). In other states, which have
weak verbal or dollar thresholds, or a right to choose to litigate after an accident, it has been
less effective.

"Choice" no-fault is a system under which drivers would be given the option of choosing either a
pure no-fault policy with fairly high policy limits (e.g., $250,000) but no access to court or a
more expensive policy which allowed court access but in which the policy-holder's insurance
company would pay, no matter who was at fault -- as is the case with uninsured motorist
coverage today. Governor Whitman has proposed a variation of this system. There would be
four policies: pure no-fault at the $250,000 level (which would have a premium reduction of
20-25%); pure no-fault with an ability to collect for pain and suffering on a first party basis
(which would result in a premium reduction of about 8%); no-fault but with access to court with
a high verbal threshhold (reduction unstated but should be some); and the traditional
second-party liability system with unfettered access to court.

Problems and opportunities

The usual rationale for moving to no-fault is that it drives down insurance premiums, and the
usual response is that it unfairly keeps injured parties from exercising their constitutional right to
access to court. A collateral argument is that first party systems "punish" both good drivers and
bad drivers who get into accidents, whereas the current system places the burden on the bad
driver. This set of arguments does not tell the whole story.

       Flaws in the Argument in Favor

Theoretically, no-fault should reduce automobile insurance premiums. A 1996 study by the
Rand Institute for Civil Justice concluded that pure no-fault would reduce personal injury
premiums by about 60%, and total premiums -- after taking into account the 50% of the typical
premium that is for property coverage -- by about 30%. There are several reasons this has not
been borne out in practice in the states that have adopted no-fault, and some additional reasons
why certain states are likely to benefit less in any event.

              As noted above, no state has pure no-fault. Where there are weak verbal
               threshholds or dollar threshholds, not only do cases continue to get to court, but
               there is pressure to inflate medical expenses to exceed the threshold.
              While legal costs are a significant part of the premium dollar, other costs are also
               important in determining how fast premiums go up, such as the rate of increase in
               medical costs (leaving aside any impact of no-fault on these costs). Moreover,
               automobile insurance is a competitive business in most states and insurance
               companies regularly cycle through periods of declining and rising premiums.
              Instates with a very high proportion of single-car accidents -- i.e., most rural
               states -- no-fault does not change the complexion of the payout system, and

                therefore should not have much effect on premiums, which are usually fairly low
                in the first place. Rand claims that the proportion of uninsured motorists doesn't
                matter much, but admits they don't really know.
               Even Rand, generally supportive of no-fault, admits that the most seriously
                injured individuals will probably get less compensation than under the current
                system. (The least seriously injured will cease being overcompensated.)

        Additional benefits from no-fault

 Even if there were no premium reduction, however, no-fault might have other benefits:

               As a medical matter, people who are injured who receive high quality medical and
                rehabilitative treatment quickly are more likely to recover fully. By keeping
                cases out of court, no-fault reduces the temptation to keep the plaintiff injured for
                the jury. Moreover, it provides the money to get the rehabilitation that's needed.
               This was important in the 1970s, but probably has gotten even more important
                since because:
                       Fewer people have medical insurance today; and
                       Seatbelts and airbags save lives, but those saved are often severely injured.
               High verbal threshold no-fault probably reduces fraud in the medical care system,
                and should reduce volume pressures on the civil justice system.

        Flaws in the Opposition

  The part of the argument in opposition that is stated in constitutional terms is basically
  unanswerable, except to note that in general not everyone has access to the civil justice system
  because of the cost and time involved in using the system. (The efforts of Republicans to get rid
  of contingency fees and institute loser pays would, of course, exacerbate this problem, and
  undoubtedly no-fault's opponents will lump any support on our part with these changes we
  oppose.) Portions of their argument relating to the lack of reduction in premiums in no-fault
  states or the fact that many rural states have much lower premiums than no-fault states ignore the
. different economics of the states and/or the problems related to low threshholds, but clearly need
  to be taken into account in determining the practical real-life impact of adopting no-fault.

 Summary

No-fault generates significant public interest at the state and local level when auto insurance
premiums are increasing rapidly (which appears not to be the case today), and may have real
policy benefits. However, there are serious questions about the extent of the benefits and the
appropriateness and efficacy of dealing with the issue at the federal level. We suggest bringing
together an NEC interagency team, including Justice, Commerce and DOT, to further investigate
existing information and develop options and recommendations.
