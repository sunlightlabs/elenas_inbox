     TEXT:
     I believe the attached gives you what you need for the "son of Sperling"
     memo.

     I have divided the "processes" in which Bill or I are involved in a
     significant way into legislative and nonlegislative. (I did not include a
     category of processes to reenergize), and indicated where we clearly had
     the lead responsibility vs. where we were significant players in somebody
     else's.

     I did not try to make sure that we have every one of the ten points in the
     Call to Action covered -- because we don't.  However, after noting that
     Gene included in his packet a Feb. 28 goals and objective memo which NEC
     "has used as our roadmap thus far this year", I want to offer you a
     30-page work plan for the Call to Action we produced last March -- the
     last time we needed to produce a list of stuff demonstrating that we were
     on top of things.  I'd be happy to include that as "the roadmap that has
     guided us this year".  I haven't read it since we produced it but, then
     again, you and Bruce promised that no one would read what we send this
     time either.
