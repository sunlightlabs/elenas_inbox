        DESIGNATION OF BILL LANN LEE AS ACTING ASSIST ANT ATTORNEY
            GENERAL AND COUNSELOR TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL


       For the past 50 years, Attorneys General -- in both Democratic and Republican
        Administrations -- have used the Justice Department's statutory authority to appoint
        acting assistant attorneys general and other acting officials. By statute, nearly all the
        functions of the Department of Justice are vested in the Attorney General (28 U.S.C.
        509). The Attorney General may -- again by statute -- authorize "the performance by an
        officer, employee, or agency of the Department of Justice of any function of the Attorney
        General." @.  510). That is what was done here.

       With the President's support and approval, Bill Lann Lee was appointed Principal Deputy
        Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division and Counselor to the Attorney
        General for Civil Rights. The Attorney General then issued an order under 28 U.S.C. ㎣
        509 and 510, assigning him the functions of the Assistant Attorney General for the
        Division. A 1971 opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel upholds the practice of
        bringing someone into the Department and immediately appointing him or her an Acting
        Assistant Attorney General, and it notes four prior examples. The Bush
        Administration used the same procedure in 1992.

       Mr. Lee is not serving pursuant to the Vacancies Act, 5 U.S.C. ㎣ 3345-49.     As noted,
        the longstanding practice of the Department of Justice, under both Republican and
        Democratic Administrations, is to use sections 509 and 510, rather than the Vacancies
        Act, to designate acting officials.

       Nevertheless, if the Vacancies Act did apply, Mr. Lee, as the first assistant in the Civil
        Rights Division could act as Assistant Attorney General so long as the President
        nominated someone within 120 days. 5 U.S.C. ㎣ 3346,3348. The fact that Mr. Lee's
        predecessor served for more than 120 days before Mr. Lee was first nominated is
        irrelevant. The Vacancies Act specifically provides that if a first or second nomination
        to fill a vacancy has been submitted, an acting official may serve until the Senate
        confirms or rejects the nomination. The President intends to resubmit Mr. Lee's
        nomination promptly.

       The Senate thus will have the opportunity to vote on Mr. Lee. Any concerns about Mr.
        Lee's status as Acting Assistant Attorney General can be easily resolved by confirming
        him in the position.
