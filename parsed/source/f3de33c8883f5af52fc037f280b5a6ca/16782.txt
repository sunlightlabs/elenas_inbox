TEXT:
attached is a I-pager on the ffi1n1mum wage and a short document on how
families have benefited wage-wise under the Clinton Administration.

==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================
ATT CREATION TIME/DATE:   0 00:00:00.00
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


                          INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE:
                          A RAISE FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES
                                           September 1, 1997


ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1997, THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE WILL INCREASE FROM
$4.75 TO $5.15. President Clinton's fight for a 90-cents per hour minimum wage boost -- which
included a first step-up from $4.25 to $4.75, effective October 1, 1996, in addition to this second step,
effective Labor Day 1997 -- increases earnings for fullotime minimum wage workers by $1,800. If
the President had not acted, the minimum wage would have fallen to its lowest real level in 40 years.

ABOUT 10 MILLION WORKERS, ALMOST 10% OF ALL WORKERS, WILL BENEFIT
FROM THE INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE -- including those who were helped by the
first step-up.

      71% of these workers are adults (age 20 and over), according to the Bureau of Labor
       Statistics.

      Almost half of these workers (46%) work full-time, and another 33% work between 20 and 34
       hours per week.

      Two out of every five (38%) of these workers are the sole wage earners in their households;
       the average minimum wage worker brings home half of the family's earnings.

      Over one million families with children are dependent on the earnings of a minimum wage
       worker (i.e., a minimum wage worker accounts for 50% or more of the family's total weekly
       earnings).

      Nearly three-fifths (58%) of the workers directly affected by the minimum wage increase are
       women. 16%, almost 1.6 million, are African American, and over 17% are of Hispanic
       origin.

THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE HAS HELPED TO LIFT EARNINGS AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION. According to data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, real earnings at the 10th decile of the earnings distribution rose almost 1 percent between
the first quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 -- faster than the growth in real median earnings.
 Many experts attribute the relative increase to the effects of the higher minimum wage.

DESPITE THE CLAIMS OF SOME CRITICS, THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE
INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE HAS NOT HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON
EMPLOYMENT. Indeed, the unemployment rate stands at 4.8%, as low as it's been in 24 years.

      According to a recent report by the Economic Policy Institute, the evidence shows that the
       minimum wage hike has increased wages for the lowest paid Americans without sacrificing
       j<?bs.

      Nearly two dozen empirical studies have found that moderate increases in the minimum wage
       do not have a significant effect on employment.

      In 1995, 101 economists, including three Nobel prize-winners, signed a letter concluding that
       the minimum wage increase's "overall effects on the labor market, affected workers, and the
       economy would be positive." The evidence suggests they were right.
                      THE ECONOMY UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON:                 anagement Syster.o
                                                        Mlc-Dwnp Convers'
                     MORE MONEY IN WORKING FAMILIES' POCKETS            Ion               .

In the 15 years before President Clinton took office, America's families worked harder just to stay afloat.
Since 1992, however, these families have seen their economic well-being improve as the economy
strengthened and President Clinton ensured that government worked better for America's working
families. Across the income spectrum, families are better off -- they have more money in their pockets
and they are more confident about their future than any other time in the last two decades.

    Minimum Wage Hike Increases Pay By $1,800 for Full-Time Worker, On September 1,1997,
    the minimum wage increases to $5.15 per hour for nearly 10 million workers. For someone working
    at the previous minimum wage, $4.25 per hour, that's a raise of90-cents per hour -- or $1,800 per
    year for a full-time worker.

   Family Incomes Up $1,600. According to the Bureau of the Census, real median family income in
    1995 was $1,600 higher than it was two years earlier. [Source: Bureau of the Census]

   Expanded EITC Puts Money Back in Working Families' Pockets. The President fought for a
    substantial expansion in the Earned Income Tax Credit in 1993 -- the average family with two kids
    who received the EITC got a tax cut of $1 ,026. [Source: Department ofTreasury]

   $500 Child Tax Credit For 27 Million Families with 45 Million Children Under Age 17. The
    balanced budget legislation that the President negotiated with the Congress includes a $500 per-child
    tax credit for children under age 17. Because of the President's efforts, 13 million children from
    families with incomes below $30,000 will receive the tax credit -- up to 7.5 million more than under
    the House plans. [Source: Department of the Treasury]

    Education Tax Breaks. The balanced budget deal also includes a $1,500 Hope Scholarship to
    make the first two years of college universally available, and a 20-percent tuition tax credit for
    college juniors, seniors, graduate students, and working Americans pursuing lifelong learning. For a
    student attending the average 4-year college, these education tax incentives will provide tax savings
    of up to $5,000. [Source: Department of the Treasury]

    Nearly 13 Million New Jobs in 4Y> Years. Since President Clinton took office, 12.9 million
    new jobs have been created -- over two-thirds in job categories paying above the median wage.
    The unemployment rate has fallen from 7.5 percent in 1992 to 4.8 percent today -- that's as low
    as it's been in 24 years. [Source: BLS]

    Lower Mortgage Rates Saving Families Thousands. According to the New York Times and
    Money, lower interest rates as a result of the President's 1993 Economic Plan saved 10 million
    families who refinanced their home mortgage between $1,000 and $2,000 per year.

    Capital Gains Tax Cut for Homeowners. The Balanced Budget Act eliminates capital gains taxes
    for up to $500,000 in gains from selling a home. This exclusion replaces the one-time $125,000
    exclusion previously available for taxpayers over age 55. [Source: Department of the Treasury]

   Closing Costs Reduced By $1,200 For First-Time Homebuyers. President Clinton has reduced
    closing costs for FHA loans three times -- these reductions, along with savings passed on to
    homebuyers from increased efficiency in the FHA, will save homebuyers $1,200 in closing costs on
    the average FHA mortgage of$85,000. [Source: HUD]

Explanation: Since Ms. Smith works full time, year-round at the minimum wage, the increased minimum wage
the President fought for will raise her earnings by $1,800 per year (90 cents per hour times 2,000 hours per year).
If President Clinton had not expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the Smith family would have
received an EITC of$2,106. Under the new law, the family will receive an EITC of$3,400 -- that's an increase
of $1 ,294 per year.

Explanation: According to the Bureau of the Census, since 1993, the real income of families similar to the Jones
family increased from $63,597 to $65,124 in 1995, adjusted for inflation. Experts -- including Alan Greenspan --
agree that President Clinton's 1993 Economic Plan helped lower interest rates. As the New York Times wrote:
"In 1993 alone, six million homeowners, most of them solidly middle class, refmanced their mortgages because of
the lower rates. Most of these families locked in rates two percentage points or so lower than their previous
mortgages. On a standard 30-year fixed mortgage of$100,000, for example, the monthly savings was $139 a
month, or $1,668 a year." [August 3, 1996] The balanced budget deal also helps the Jones family by providing
a $500 child tax credit for their 13-year old son and $1,500 HOPE scholarship tax credit for their 18-year old
daughter in college.
