 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:          BRUCE REED
                GENE SPERLING
                CHRIS JENNINGS

 SUBJECT:       Reforms that Prepare Medicare for the Retirement of the. Baby Boom
                Generation

 Overview

          The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) that you enacted took critically necessary steps to
  modernize the Medicare program and prepare it for the twenty-first century. It extended the life
  of the Trust Fund to 2010, invested in preventive benefits, provided more choice of plans for
. beneficiaries, str~ngthened our ongoing fraud act~vities, and lowered cost growth to slightly
  below the private sector rate through provider payment reforms and modest beneficiary payment
  increases. However, the BBA's policies were not intended to solve the long-term problems
  posed by the retirement of the baby boom generation.

        The Medicare Commission was established to address the demographic challenges facing
 the program. However, a major policy and political question remains. Is there anything we can
 and should do prior to the March 1999 Commission deadline that could further strengthen the
 program and lay the groundwork for implementation oflikely Commission recommendations?

         The National Economic Council (NEC) and Domestic Policy Council (DPC) have led an
 interagency examination of several, targeted policy options. We examine options for coverage
 for pre-65 year olds, Medicare coverage of patient care costs associated with clinical trials, and a
 project to increase awareness of private long-term care insurance. Financing options to pay for
 this proposal follow this description.

         Your advisors have differing views, both as to the advisability of pursuing any new
 proposals while the Medicare Commission is active, and which proposals to pursue if you do.
 OMB and to some extent Treasury have concerns about a pre-65 option, because it may open the
 door to.subsidies for a costly population and have the. unintended effect of reducing employer
 coverage. Both OMB and Treasury feel negatively about the clinical cancer trials proposal since
 it could set a precedent for every other disease group asking for the same treatment. In addition,
 it may well be the case, that the traditional Medicare savings alone. will not be sufficient to offset
 the costs of these proposals. As such, a decision to propose a pre-65 policy may be feasible only
 if the decision is made to propose an income-related premium or, much less likely, dollars from
 any residual tobacco tax. It is worth noting that an income-related premium would clearly be
 more politically viable to our Democratic base if it were linked to a benefit expansion.
A.     PRE-65 HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS
                                                                       Hex.Dump Conversion
        Although people between 55 and 65 years old are generally more likely to have insurance
than the general population, they often face greater problems accessing affordable health
insurance, especially those who are sick. They are at greater risk of having health problems,
with twice the probability of experiencing heart disease, strokes and cancer as people ages 45 to
54. Yet their access to affordable employer coverage is often lower due to work and family
transitions. Work transition increase as people approach 65, with many retiring or shifting to
part-time work or self-employment as a bridge to retirement. Some of this transition is
involuntary. Nearly half of people 55 to 65 years old who lose their jobs due to firms
downsizing or closing do not get re-employed.

        Family transitions also reduce access to employer-based health insurance for the
increased number of people who are widowed, divorced, or whose spouse has gotten Medicare
and retired. As a result, the pre-65 year olds, more than any other age group, rely upon the
individual health insurance market. Without the advantages of having their costs averaged with
other younger people (as in employer-based insurance), these people often face relatively high
premiums and, because of the practice of medical underwriting, may be unable to get coverage at
any price if they have pre-existing medical conditions. While the Kassebaum-Kennedy
legislation improved access for people with pre-existing conditions, it did not restrict costs.

        These access problems will increase due to two trends: the decline in retiree health
coverage and the aging of the baby boom generation. Recently, firms have cut back on offering
pre-65 retirees health coverage; in 198467 percent oflarge and mid-sized firms offered retiree
insurance but in 1997 only 37 percent did (although decline may be slowing). In addition, in
several small but notable cases (e.g., General Motors and Pabst Brewery), retirees' health
benefits were dropped unilaterally, despite the firm's commitment to their retirees. These
"broken promise" retirees do not have access to COBRA continuation coverage and could have
difficultly finding affordable individual insurance. A more important trend is the demographics.
 The number of people 55 to 65 years old will increase from 22 to 30 million by 2005 and 35
million by 2010 _. over a 50 percent increase. Assuming current rates ofuninsurancl<, this
could raise the number of uninsured in this age group from 3 million today to 4 million by 2005,
without even taking into account the decline in retiree health coverage.

        The last reason for considering the coverage issues of this age group is the likelihood of
proposals to raise Medicare eligibility age to 67. The Federal government will be raising the
normal Social Security retirement age to 67, and the Medicare Commission will likely consider
this option for Medicare as well. The experience with covering a pre-65 age group now will
teach us valuable lessons if we need to develop policy options for the 65 to 67 year oIds.

Policy Questions. Two central questions guide policy decisions in this area: what is the target
population, and what is the best way to cover these people.



                                                 2
                                                                          Hcx-DLlmp Conversion
         Whom to Target? As with any incremental reform, targeting is essential to reduce the
chance that the policy does not unintentionally offset or reduce employer health coverage.
While this policy will not affect employers' decisions to offer coverage to their current workers,
it may affect employers' decisions to cover retirees and employees' decisions to retire early. At
the same time, the current level of employer dropping suggests that a policy for the affected
people is needed. Although your advisors remain divided on the advisability of implementing a
new policy in this area, we all agree that if you decide to move in this direction that any policy
should include protections against substitution. The easiest way to accomplish this is limiting
eligibility to a subset of the pre-65 year olds. There are two design approaches to achieve this.

       The first approach is to limit eligibility by age. We recommend an age break of 62,
which is already the most common retirement age. The 6 million people age 62 to 65, compared
to people ages 55 to 59, work less (48 percent versus 74 percent), are more likely to have fair to
poor health (26 versus 20 percent), and are more likely to be uninsured or buy individual
insurance (28 versus 21 percent). In addition, it is also the age at which Social Security benefits
can be accessed. Within this 6 million, we could limit eligibility to the 2 million without access
to employer or public insurance, and would require that they exhaust COBRA coverage before
becoming eligible, to reduce the incentive to retire or drop retiree coverage due to this option.

        A second approach is to limit eligibility within a broader age group, e.g., 55 to 65 year
olds, by a lack of access to employer-based insurance. Three groups have particular problems.
(1) Displaced workers: About 60,000 people ages 55 to 65 lost their employer insurance when
they became displaced workers (lost their job due to the firm closing, downsizing, etc). (2)
Medicare spouses: About 420,000 uninsured people are spouses (almost all wives) of Medicare
beneficiaries who may have lost employer-based family coverage when their husbands tUrned 65
and retired. This number could be larger if employers drop retirees' dependent coverage for these
spouses due to this policy. (3) "Broken promise" people: A small but visible and vulnerable
group is the pre-65 retirees who lose retiree health coverage due to a "broken promise" (employer
unexpectedly terminates coverage).

        How to Provide Coverage? The second question is: what is the best way to increase
access to affordable insurance? One approach is to extend COBRA continuation coverage for
longer than 18 months. Currently, COBRA allows workers with insurance in firms with 20 or
more employees (COBRA exempts small firms) to continue that coverage for 18 months by
paying 102 percent of the premium-. The major problems with this approach are that not all
people are eligible, businesses will consider this an unfunded mandate, and such a policy could
lead to discrimination against hiring older workers. In addition, firms that do not want to cover
their employees anyway could use this longer COBRA mandate as their excuse not to do so.
Despite these difficulties, a COBRA extension appears to be the best option for the ''broken
promise" people, since the former employer would bear some of the costs of its decision to
terminate coverage and COBRA could then serve as a "bridge to Medicare" for this population.




                                                3
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
        A second option, preferable for most of the target groups, is a Medicare ''buy-in''.
Eligible people could buy into Medicare at the age-adjusted Medicare payment rate, plus an
add-on for the extra risk of participants. Since the actuaries think that most participants will be
sicker than average, this add-on will be costly. To attract healthier people and make it possible
for more people to take advantage of the benefit, we could defer payment of the additional cost
until age 65 by "amortizing" this payment. The participant would make payments it in
installments with their Part Bpremium after they tum 65 for the rest. In other words, Medicare
would pay part of the premium as a loan up front, with repayment by the beneficiaries. The
HCFA actuaries have estimated that this Medicare loan in a worse-case scenario would cost $1.1
billion per year (with participation of no more than 300,000 people). Because they assumed
only sick people would participate, that all would enroll in one year, and because they did not
take into account the pay-back from beneficiaries, the official estimates, expected soon, will
probably be lower. Subsidies would be considerably more costly and your advisors agree that
we cannot afford it.

       Option 1. "Broken Promise" People Only. All your advisors recommend a policy
that employers who break their promise of retiree coverage be required to allow those retirees to
buy into their active employer plan at a rate of 150 percent of the premium (since this age group
is more expensive) until age 65. This option has no cost to the Federal government.

        Option 2. Medicare Buy-In for Select Groups. The second option is to allow a
limited group of 55 to 65 year olds to buy into Medicare. If you decide to consider any of the
Medicare buy-in proposals, OMB favors undertaking only the Medicare spouses - primarily
uninsured women ages 55 to 65 whose husbands are already on Medicare. They argue that, if
the goal is a limited test of a buy-in for the pre-65 year olds, this is a discrete group whose
eligibility would likely have a smaller effect on the general trend in retiree health coverage or
retirement. Labor strongly supports policies to help displaced workers, since it fits with the
broader theme of trying to improve the security of workers. While a Medicare buy-in would
help more of these workers, in the absence of a buy-in, Labor would support a COBRA
extension. HHS supports covering these select groups but is concerned that the enrollment be
sufficient enough to justify the administrative effort. The small size of these groups also means
that the costs will be low.           .

        Option 3. Medicare Buy-In for 62 to 65 years old plus selected groups. The third
option is to permit eligibility for age 62 to 65 years old plus the Medicare spouses and displaced
workers. The cost of this option is not known yet but could be as much as $5 billion over 5
years. HHS and NECIDPC think that this is a narrow enough group to limit significantly the
effects on retiree health coverage or retirement. This group is also is more representative of the
65 to 67 year old population, giving a better sense of what would happen if Medicare eligibility
were postponed to 67 years old. Although Treasury is concemed that this policy could become
an underfinanced policy expansion, some concerns would be allayed if the buy-in participants
were enrolled only in managed care. This would mean that the insurers and not Medicare would
bear the risk, but this could be politically difficult given the distrust of managed care. However,
OMB is thinks that this group is not narrow enough and the ''unsubsidized entitlement" (the
subsidy is in the financing) will not stay that way for long. It is important to note that we are

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
still waiting for actuarial analyses, which could alter the recommendations or your advisors.
B.      PRIVATE LONG-TERM CARE OPTIONS

         A second idea to improve access to insurance focuses on long-term care. Unlike acute
care, long-term care is not primarily financed by private insurance, which only pays 6 percent of
its costs. Medicaid pays for 38 percent, Medicare pays for 21 percent, and families pay for 28 of
the costs out of pocket. This large government role may not be sustainable as the baby boom
generation retires. Today, one in four people over age 85 live in a nursing home. This cOuld
increase substantially as the proportion of elderly living to age 90 is projected to increase from 25
percent to 42 percent by 2050. Thus, it is important to encourage the development of private
insurance options. The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation took a step in this direction by
clarifying that certain long-term care insurance are tax deductible. However, given that many
people incorrectly assume Medicare covers all of their long-term care needs and do not know
about private long-term care insurance, more action is needed. This action could include
providing information to Medicare beneficiaries about private insurance, funding a
demonstration program to improve the quality and price of private insurance, or both. None of
these options includes a new Medicare entitlement or subsidy.

Information on Quality Private Long-Term Care Insurance

        We propose to leverage our role in Medicare to improve the quality of and access to
private policies and clarifY that Medicare is an acute care program. Medicare would allow
certain privatelong-term care policies to be included in its general information on Medicare
managed care. HeFA would work with insurers, state regulators, and other interested parties to
develop a set of minimum standards. If a plan met these standards, it could be included in the
new managed care information system. As a reminder, the BBA 1997 included provisions to
provide annual information on managed care choices to beneficiaries. This proposal would
                                    .                                            .
build upon that system and would cost up to $25 million in discretionary funds over 5 years ($5
million in FY 1999), distinct from the user fees are currently authorized for the managed care
information. The cost of a demonstration would depend on its size and policy parameters, but
could be limited to $100 to 300 million over 5 years.

        We believe this proposal has significant potential and is worth further developing. There
is some concern at HHS that coming to an agreement on a set of standards could be difficult and
that insurers may argue that our standards drive up the cost of the policies, making them
unaffordable. They also would prefer that the demonstration be funded through the mandatory
budget. However, these concerns may not be insurmountable, especially since one objective of
a demonstration could be to investigate high quality private options that are affordable.

C.     MEDICARE COVERAGE OF CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS

        Medicare has not traditionally covered patient care costs associated with clinical
trials. Scientists and advocates believe that we are not making sufficient progress in
treating cancer, in part because of low participation in these trials that stems from lack of·
Medicare's coverage. HHS and DPC have been working on an approach that covers
patient care for a limited number of these trials. Because of concerns about cost potential,
OMB and Treasury strongly oppose this option.

        Nearly half of all cancer patients are covered by Medicare, yet Medicare does not
cover patient care costs associated with these trials. This care can often be prohibitively
expensive for cancer patients and their families, perhaps explaining why only 3 percent of
all cancer patients participate in trials. Historically most insurers have covered clinical
trials for children; As a consequence, nearly 70 percent of children with cancer
participate in clinical trials. Scientists agree that this fact has helped improve cancer
treatments for children, and some argue that this is one reason for the dramatically higher
survival rates for children cancer patients.

         This problem has significant implications for research in all cancer areas,
particularly for those cancers like prostate cancer where scientists still have no good
answers and where clinical trials are particularly undersubscribed. According to a former
National Cancer Institute director, if 10 percent of all cancer patients participated in such
trials, then trials that currently take three to five years would only take one year.

        Expanding Medicare to cover cancer clinical trials would represent an important
step for two reasons. First, all Americans covered by Medicare, not'just those who can
afford it, would have a choice of participating in cancer trials. Second, as the nation's
largest insurer, Medicare plays a significant role in setting the standard for the insurance
companies. A commitment from Medicare to cover clinical trials would go a long way in
encouraging private insurance companies to agree to cover these trials.         .

Proposal

       We have developed a proposal to expand Medicare to cover cancer cliilical trials
conducted at the NCI and trials with comparable peer review. In addition, we would
require the National Cancer Policy Board to make further coverage recommendations, and
HHS to assess the incremental costs of such trials compared to conventional
Medicare-covered therapies. Assuming the true incremental costs are substantially less
than the actuaries project, as we believe, additional trial coverage as recommended by the
Board could occur. The initial coverage would cost $1.7 billion over five years. Senators
Mack and Rockefeller have developed a more expansive and expensive proposal
(co-sponsored by 26 Senators), which covers all FDA trials, many of which the experts
believe do not meet a scientifically-meritorious standard. While their support for our
modest approach is not assured, their views will weigh heavily with patient groups and the
cancer community. However, we do believe that there may be some trials above the $1.7

billion proposal that could be justified on policy grounds.
        A possible alternative way to cover clinical cancer trial's' patient care costs is to
directly dedicate resources from any significant increases that NIH / NCI receive in the
upcoming budget. NCI could use these increase to simplify and centralize their clinical
trials system, which has the potential to increase patient access. Although this mar be a
viable option, the cancer community has clearly stated their preference that extending
Medicare coverage is their top priority in this area, as they believe that patients need better
access to these cutting edge treatments.

Discussion

       HHS is supportive of this policy and believes that it would not only give Medicare
beneficiaries, who represent a significant portion of cancer patients, much-needed choices
but would encourage the private industry to cover clinical trials as weD. There is no
question that this proposal is the highest priority for most of the cancer community as weD
as many in the women's community who believe it is an essential step to improve breast
cancer treatment. However, the advocates have made it clear that they would strongly
prefer the more expansive and expensive RockefeDerlMack approach. We are working to
determine whether we can modify our more limited proposal in a way that they would
support.

        OMB and Treasury oppose the Medicare coverage option strongly. They note that
it would involve very substantial costs ($1 to $3 billion per year) to provide medical services
that are experimental, and therefore are unlikely to help the majority of beneficiaries.           '-
Once an exception has been made for experimental cancer drugs and therapies, they argue
there is no reason that similar support won't be demanded for experimentation with
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other maladies. As a result, these costs will grow as other
therapies are included. They also believe that Congress would likely expand the proposal
beyond coverage of only NCI trials- given the fact that prime Hill sponsors favor broader
coverage- and such expanded coverage will be very costly (up to $3 billion over five years).
 OMB also does not believe that Medicare should lead the way on clinical trials, but rather
drug companies should be the first to contribute to improving access for Medicare
beneficiaries.

        The DPCINEC believes that OMB and Treasury raise some valid concerns.
However, we would support this proposal if we can develop an affordable option that both
Senator RockefeDer and Senator Mack and the cancer community would strongly support.
 If we cannot obtain such support in short order, we would recommend not including it in
the budget. We would be in a very good position to argue our likely support fora
significant increase in biomedical research will also pay large dividends in cancer
breakthroughs and are more than sufficient in this budget year. However, if we decide to
not fuDy double the NIH budget, as described in a separate memo, this policy might be
more important to reenforcing your commitment to research. FinaDy, if it becomes clear
that our fmal cost estimates for the Medicare buy-in are low enough to be financed by the
available $2 billion in traditional (anti-fraud) Medicare savings, the DPC and NEC would

recommend giving serious consideration to use these limited dollars to support the
Medicare buy-in proposal. However, HHS prefers that these offsets be used only for the
clinical cancer trial proposal.

1)-    PAYING FOR INITIATIVES: AN INCOME-RELATED PREMIUM AND OTHER
       OPTIONS

         We assume that the funding for these Medicare initiatives will require Medicare offsets.
One approach is to use Medicare anti-fraud initiatives. HHS and OMB believe that this could
total about $2 billion over 5 years. This could fund some, but not all of the initiatives described
above. To fund a more expansive series of initiatives, then you may need to move beyond this
list to consider an income-related premium. As you know, Medicare subsidizes 75 percent of
the Part B premium for all beneficiaries, including the wealthiest. This is not only regressive; it
ignores the fact that studies show that higher income beneficiaries actually cost Medicare more
than poor beneficiaries. However, this is moving away from the concept of social insurance.

Income-Related Premium Policy Options

        Building from our position from last summer, the income-related premium would be
administered by the Treasury Department, not HeFA or the Social Security Administration.
Annually, eligible people would fill out a Medicare Premium Adjustment form (a separate form
or a line on the 1040 form) and send a check to "The Medicare Trust Fund". The two open
questions are: "Who pays?" and "How much?" Depending upon the design, this proposal could
generate at least $8 billion over five years.

        Who pays. Last summer, the Senate passed a policy where the extra premium payment
began at $50,000 for singles and $65,000 for couples. However, we proposed higher thresholds
in the Health Security Act: $90,000 for singles and $115,000 for couples. These thresholds
determine how many people are paying the higher amount.

        How much. The amount of the payment for the wealthiest beneficiaries is a second
question. In the budget debate, we argued that would should not go to a 100 percent premium.
(no subsidy) because that could cause some healthy and wealthy people to opt out of Medicare.
However, an analysis by the Treasury Department this fall found that the effects would be small
(about 5% of beneficiaries who pay the full premium would drop). HHS would strongly object
to changing our position and supporting an income-related premium that completely phases out
the Part B subsidy. Ifwe decided to change our past policy, it might be advisable to have a
strategic discussion about the timing of announcing such a change. It could be an important in
negotiating the give and take on this issue.

        OMB's position ultimately depends upon the entire package of initiatives and savings
being offered. OMB considers the income-related premium to be a sound policy option, but
believes that it could be considered as a means of either offsetting Medicare Trust Fund
insolvency or providing benefit expansions for the currently eligible Medicare population.
HHS believes that if an income-related premium is pursued, its savings are used for Medicare.
They argue that Medicare has already contributed $115 billion in savings and it may make sense
to preserve this option for the Commission recommendations; otherwise, the Commission could
be left with fewer moderate options.

         From DPCINEC's perspective, it is a matter of balance. On one hand, it is almost certain
that this policy will be recommended by the Medicare Commission. At that point, however, we
will have less opportunity to direct any of its revenue toward important Medicare reforms like a
Medicare buy-in. In addition, between the baseline and policy reductions, it is highly unlikely
that there will be enough health savings in the future to redirect toward coverage initiatives. If
we do not pursue the premium and have insufficient funding for coverage initiatives, this will be
the first time that your budget will not include a new coverage expansion initiative, with the
exception of the period in which we were developing and debating Health Security. Act.

        On the other hand, we need to seriously consider the fact that many Democrats and
possibly AARP would oppose the income-related premium for the same reason HHS cites.
A possible exception is if it is explicitly linked to a pre-65 policy. In addition, Republicans
might take this opportunity to label this as a new tax and use it as an issue during the 1998
campaign. Even ifhe philosophically supports the premium, Speaker Gingrich might use the
high-income premium's "tax" label as cover for his likely opposition to a Medicare
buy-in.
