                                         April 3, 1998


MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report


        Tobacco -- MMWR Study: On April 2, in conjunction with Kick Butts Day, the CDC
released a new study ("Tobacco Use Among High School Students -- United States, 1997")
which found that cigarette smoking rates among high school students rose by nearly a third
between 1991 and 1997, from 27.5 percent to 36.4 percent, with the sharpest increase among
African American students. The study found that, overall, nearly half (48 percent) of male
students and more than a third of female students reported using tobacco products in the previous
month. Among white students, slightly over 50 percent of males and 40 percent of females used
tobacco products within the previous month. Cigarette smoking was highest among white
students (40 percent), rising by 28 percent from 1991 (31 percent). While the level of cigarette
smoking among African-American students was lower than for white students, the rate increased
by 80 percent between 1991 and 1997 for African-American students (from 12.6 percent to 22.7
percent). This 1997 data was derived from a survey of over 16,000 students in grades 9-12.

         Tobacco -- Next Steps: Following the 19-1 vote in favor of the tobacco legislation in
the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator McCain indicated that the bill is likely to go to the
floor during the week of May 18th (the week preceding the Memorial Day recess). We expect
that the Majority Leader will want to have some sort of leadership agreement before bringing the
bill to the floor. We plan to sit down with Senator Daschle to discuss our priorities and work
out an agreed-upon strategy for a negotiation with Lott (in which we expect McCain and Hollings
to also be involved). We will work with the Commerce Committee staff to encourage them to
incorporate technical changes in a manager's amendment, and will meet with key Senate staff to
discuss our concerns regarding the penalty, antitrust, environmental tobacco smoke, and spending
provisions of the McCain bill. We will also encourage House members to introduce the McCain
bill in the House in order to generate momentum there.

        Tobacco -- Tobacco Farmers Legislation Included in McCain Bill: Senators Ford,
Frist, and Hollings, the three members of the Senate Commerce Committee from
tobacco-growing states, joined together to include a broad-based farmer package in the McCain
comprehensive tobacco legislation. The package includes a buy-out for quota holders at $8 per
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

pound as well as maintaining a government production-control program for those who continue
to grow tobacco. It also provides assistance to tobacco-producing communities. This package
would cost $2.1 billion per year for the first ten years and $500 million for years 11-25 for a total
of $28.5 billion. This package incorporates some changes in the flue-cured program, as
advocated by Senator Robb, such as transferring quotas from inactive quota holders to actual
producers. The Domestic Policy Council, along with representatives of USDA, have met with
farmers' groups from Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia,
and Florida. For the most part, tobacco farmers are very pleased with the proposal included in
the McCain legislation. Senator Lugar had proposed a buy-out program for $8 per pound which
would discontinue any kind of tobacco-support program, leaving the crop in a free market. By
and large, farmers have opposed Senator Lugar's proposal. Today Secretary Glickman is
holding a town hall meeting with tobacco farmers in Lexington, Kentucky. Governor Patton,
along with Lt. Governor Henry, Congressman Baesler, and DPC staff are also in attendance.

        Health Care -- Democratic Unveil Patients' Bill of Rights: On Tuesday, the
Democratic Leadership introduced their version of the patients' bill of rights in a ceremony
attended by Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. Your letter to the Leadership, which indicated
strong support for this bill without providing an all out endorsement, was extremely well
received. This legislation includes every patient protection recommended by your Advisory
Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality and builds on these recommendations,
including an enforcement provision that provides for state court-based remedies. Because the
business and insurer community is petrified that opening up the door to litigation will
significantly increase their costs, this provision is the most controversial aspect of the bill. In
addition, the business community strongly opposes this provision because it would preempt the
Employment Retirement Insurance Security Act (ERISA) protections they currently enjoy and
would set a precedent for allowing states to impose regulations beyond current Federal law.
This legislation also includes a compromise "whistleblower protection" provision that is
acceptable to the labor community and has not raised serious objections from the hospital
community. We helped draft this compromise provision, and Congressman Dingell and Senator
Kennedy were extremely appreciative of our help in this regard.

        Health Care -- On Track to Cover One Million Children at Sixth Month
Anniversary of the Children's Health Insurance Program: Wednesday marked the sixth
month anniversary ofthe Children's Health Insurance Program. Donna Shalala, in an event with
Bruce Reed and Gene Sperling, announced the approval of New York and Illinois children's
health plans. With these two new approvals, eight states have come into this new program and
will provide health care coverage for one million children. At this event, we also released an
NECIDPC report on the rapid implementation ofthis new program. The report documents that
an additional 15 states have already submitted proposals to HHS to expand health care coverage
and that virtually every other state has a process underway to submit a proposal. We anticipate
approving Michigan's children's health program next week, possibly in conjunction with a
children's health outreach event the First Lady is currently scheduled to hold.



                                                 2
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

         Health Care -- Provider Tax Legislation: On Thursday, HHS sent legislation to the
Hill that will provide Secretary Shalala additional authority to significantly limit liability for
states that are out of compliance with their Medicaid provider taxes if they come into compliance
prospectively. As you will recall, this issue received a great deal of attention last fall after your
line item veto of a BBA provision to grandfather in New York's provider taxes. You chose to
veto this provision because we felt that it was inappropriate to single out New York for special
treatment by explicitly allowing them to use provider taxes that other states use that HHS and
OMB believe are illegal. The veto raised the issue of enforcement of all provider taxes and
forced us to develop a strategy to bring states into compliance. Rather than immediately
implementing enforcement actions, we called on Congress to give the Secretary more authority to
waive past liability for states who come into compliance. We set an August deadline to provide
incentives for the Congress to move in a timely basis because the Justice Department believes
that an ongoing delay of enforcement actions is contrary to current law. However, there has
been little appetite to pass such legislation in part because the Members on the Committees of
Jurisdiction -- House Commerce and Senate Finance -- do not come from states with provider tax
problems, and they believe the Administration should use its current authority to take action
against these states. Moreover, N ew York has subsequently won their court case on this issue
and therefore has no incentive to support any legislation that would toughen up on provider
taxes. Other states who have taxes that are out of compliance feel past history suggests that we
will not strongly enforce provider tax rules, and even if we do they can delay final action for
years through the courts. However, we believe that sending up legislation will place us in a
better position should Congress not act before our August deadline thus forcing us to initiate
inevitably unpopular enforcement actions.

        Political Reform -- Free Television Petition: Chairman Kennard and key members of
Congress reached an agreement last week in which the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) agreed to postpone rulemaking procedures on your request to establish a system of free
television time and move instead to a Notice of Inquiry (Nor) next month. Although this maybe
perceived by some in the press as temporary setback, in reality the NOI will not change the
timetable for the implementation of a free television time rule and the strategy of going to an NOI
was supported by the reform groups. The Nor will provide enough time for the
Moonves-Omstein Commission to finish their work next Fall after which the FCC can go
forward with a rulemaking procedure. The key question is whether the Moonves-Omstein
Commission can develop an acceptable compromise between the broadcasters and the reformers
that will build support in Congress for an FCC rulemaking.

        Drunk Driving -- .08 BAC: On Tuesday, the House Rules Committee decided not
to allow for a vote on the Lowey amendment -- which would set a uniform standard on
impaired driving at .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) -- to pending ISTEA legislation. This
week, there were two press events held in the White House with Administration officials
and Rep. Lowey to continue our push for the .08 BAC legislation. The Senate adopted
identical legislation offered by Senator Lautenberg with a strong 62-32 bipartisan vote.



                                                 3
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
This will leave the .OS BAC issue as one of the outstanding issues for the conference
committee to resolve.
        Crime -- Assault Weapons: The Treasury Department is near completion of its
report in response to your November 1997 directive on modified assault weapons. As you
recall, you directed Secretary Rubin to temporarily suspend the importation of certain
modified assault rifles while Treasury determined whether or not these rifles complied with
the "sporting purposes test" and could be legally imported under the Gun Control Act of
1965.We expect that Treasury will recommend permanently banning from importation
the 5 basic types of modified assault rifles studied, which represent more than 50 specific
models. This will include AK-47- and Uzi-type models. We will release the report at an
event in the Rosegarden on Monday, April 6.

         Children and Families -- After-School Event: In response to a recent DPC memo on
your education agenda, you indicated an interest in doing an after-school event. Weare
planning an event in May to: (1) announce the first grants ofthe 21st Century Learning Centers
Program, as funded in FY 98; (2) release a joint report by the Department of Justice and the
Department of Education on the effect of after-school programs on reducing crime and
improving school performance; and (3) announce the pilot cities for the Administration's effort
to coordinate federal funding and oversight of after-school programs, which you announced as
part of your child care proposal. Ideally, this event would take place at a high quality
after-school program (like the one at Temple University you suggested), or a program that will
receive a 21 st Century Learning Centers grants. This event will help demonstrate how
after-school programs can keep children safe and improve their performance in school, which
will in turn help build support for this initiative in the appropriations process. At this time, the
Department of Education is working closely with Senator Jeffords to ensure his strong support of
our proposed expansion of the program in the appropriations process.

         Welfare-- Agreement Reached to Restore Food Stamps to Legal Immigrants: A
conference committee reached agreement last week on a plan to restore $818 million over five
years in food stamps to legal immigrants. The President's budget proposed to restore $2.5
billion for this purpose. However, the bill's prospects for passage on the Senate floor are
somewhat clouded. Senator Lott has now put a hold on the bill because he wishes to use the
bill's funding sources for transportation purposes.

       The conference agreement reflects the Administration's request for refugees and asylees,
the Hmong, and the diE!abled. For refugees and asylees, it would lengthen from 5 to 7 years the
period of time that they are eligible for food stamps after they arrive in the U.S., giving them
more time to naturalize. Hmong immigrants from Laos who assisted the U.S. in Vietnam and
then came to the U.S. War would remain eligible for food stamps. Disabled legal immigrants
who entered the country before welfare reform was passed and who became disabled after they
entered the country would also retain food stamps.




                                                 4
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion ·

        The agreement differs from the Administration's proposal in two respects. First, it will
provide food stamps for children who were here when the law was signed, but not their parents.
The President's budget would cover both children and their parents, and both those here when the
law was signed and those who arrived after. Second, the agreement will retain eligibility for the
elderly who were 65 or older and in the U.S. when the welfare law was signed. Our budget
proposal would have gone further, also providing benefits to those who were in the country when
the law was signed and who subsequently tum 65.

       A major source of funding for these restorations is a cutback in funding for food stamps
administrative costs, based on the rationale that states are able to claim these costs twice, under
both food stamp and the T ANF block grant. States dispute this rationale.

        Welfare -- High Performance Bonus: Rep. Shaw has taken issue with our formula for
distributing high performance bonus funds under TANF because it does not include any measure
of state success in improving family formation, including increasing two-parent families and
reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies. In developing our measures of success, we chose to focus
on work -oriented measures -- job entry, retention, and gain in earnings -- partly because of the
difficulty of developing family formation measures that fairly measure state performance. Shaw
charges that our approach is at odds with the purpose of the high performance bonus under the
statute. Wernet with his staff this week to discuss potential family formation measures and the
problems with each one, and will meet again soon.

         Disability Issues -- Legislative Action on Disability Issues: There was action on the
Hill in the past two weeks on the disability community's two highest priorities. We are sorting
out whether the Administration will be able to support these initiatives, in full or in part.

         First, the House held a hearing on how to allow more people with disabilities to live in
their communities instead of nursing homes. Disability advocates, led by the group ADAPT, are
pushing legislation known as CAS A. Advocates do not expect CASA to become law because of
its cost ($10-20 billion per year), but they hope it will start a dialogue on the subject. HHS
witnesses testified that we have concerns about the cost, but said we are pushing to achieve the
goals of the legislation through more modest steps such as demonstrations. Speaker Gingrich
testified in favor of this concept, although without endorsing CASA itself. The disability
community is disappointed that we have not been more supportive. We have proposed that you
send a letter to Speaker Gingrich describing what progress HHS has made and stating your
agreement with the legislation's goals, but OMB has expressed reservations about such a letter.

        Second, legislation is moving in both houses to encourage people with disabilities on the
ssm or SSI rolls to return to work. Sens. Jeffords and Kennedy just introduced a bill in the
Senate, while Reps. Bunning and Kennelly'S bill was just marked up in the House. The sticking
point in both of these proposals is that they would allow people to retain Medicare or Medicaid
after they return to work, which HHS and OMB are both inclined to oppose because of costs.
Our opposition to this legislation would be a major disappointment to the community,


                                                 5
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

particularly in the wake of your signing the executive order to help increase employment of
people with disabilities. We are working with HHS and OMB to identify what portions of these
bills we are able to support and what alternatives we may have to offer.

         Welfare Reform -- Federal Hiring Initiative: The Vice President will participate in an event
on April 9th to mark the one-year anniversary of the Cabinet meeting where you asked Federal
agencies to develop plans to hire welfare recipients. The initiative is proceeding well.
Agencies have hired nearly 3,700 welfare recipients and are on track to meet the
government-wide goal of 10,000 by 2000. The VP will announce these latest numbers, release
an annual report highlighting agency accomplishments and lessons learned (the report includes a
brief message from you), encourage companies who do business with the federal government to
do their part, and urge cabinet members to leverage these commitments with the contractor
community. The VP will be joined by OPM Director Lachance, Deputy Transportation
Secretary Downey, at least one business from the Welfare to Work Partnership Board (United's
CEO encouraged the federal government to reach out to our contractors just as they have reached
out to their supplier network), and one former welfare recipient. Letters to each Cabinet
member have been prepared for your signature thanking them for leadership on this issue and
encouraging them to continue supporting this initiative within their agency, stakeholder groups,
and contractor community.

         Welfare Reform -- APWA Resolution: Last week, the American Public Welfare
Association passed a resolution urging Congress to enact your two FY 99 budget initiatives
related to welfare reform: the $100 million a year Access to Jobs welfare to work transportation
initiative and the $283 million a year proposal to provide 50,000 housing vouchers to help people
leaving welfare to get or keep a job. The Access to Jobs initiative is now authorized at $150
million in both the House and Senate ISTEA reauthorization bills, although the House still
contains a 10 project cap. While there has been considerable support for linking housing
vouchers to welfare-to-work, HUD expects that it will be an uphill fight to get funding for these
vouchers given larger Congressional concerns regarding Section 8. We are working with HUD,
DOT, HHS, and DOL on a joint secretarial event to rally support for both initiatives in the
appropriations process.

         Education -- Education Opportunity Zones: Rep. Clay is planning to introduce
  your Education Opportunity Zones bill on April 1, before the Congressional recess. We
. are planning an event that will focus on this proposal later in April, possibly in New York,
  Los Angeles or San Francisco.                                                  .

      Education -- National Board for Professional Teaching Standards: We have been
working very closely with the NBPTS to devise a strategy for securing continued federal
support in light of Goodling's move last week to end federal funding for the Board. Gov.
Hunt and the Board President Jim Kelley have been very pleased to learn of your strong
support in the face of this threat. Because the Senate Labor and Human Resources
