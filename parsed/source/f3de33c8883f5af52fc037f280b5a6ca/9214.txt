Q.   What is the Department of Education report on School Poverty and Academic
     Performance?

     The Department of Education released a report to day that examines student achievement
     in the context of school poverty in the United States. The report presents analyses of
     recent and long-term data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
     assessment results in reading and math for 4th grade students in high- and low- poverty
     schools. Student achievement data reveal that students in schools with concentrated poverty
     tend to begin school academically behind their low-poverty peers and are often unable to
     close this gap as they progress through school. The report examines trends in this
     long-standing gap in academic perfonnance between students in high-poverty and
     low-poverty schools. The key findings of the report are:

     Math
    Math scores show significant achievement gains in for 4th grade students across all levels of
     school poverty from 1992-1996. In high-poverty schools, the percentage of 4th graders that
     scored at least at the basic level was 42 percent in 1996, up from 26 percent in 1992.
     Twenty-seven states showed significant gains for 4th grade math students in high-poverty
     schools.

    Achievement gap in math narrowing. In 1996, students in high-poverty schools scored an
     average of 22 points below their peers in low-poverty schools -- this is down from a 28 point
     gap in 1992 and a 24-point gap in 1994.

     Reading
    4th Grade Reading scores remained relatively flat from 1992-1994. Five states demonstrated
     significant gains in reading for 4th grade students in high-poverty schools.

    Achievement gap in reading shows slight improvement. The average difference in reading
     achievement between high poverty and low poverty schools is higher than in math -- the gap
     was 38 points in 1996, but it is down from a gap of 40 points in 1994.

Q.   How many schools face the problems with poverty and academic achievement?

     Overall, 34% of the nation's schools have student populations where half or more of the
     students come from low-income families. Urban communities, in particular, are faced
     with dense concentrations of poverty that pose formidable challenges for schools. In
     Baltimore, for example, more than 80% of the schools have populations where more than
     half the students fall below the poverty line.

Q.   What education disadvantages are faced by children in poverty?

                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
       many experiences that impair learning, including family instability, neglect, abuse, poor
       health, crime, limited parental involvement, fewer well-prepared teachers, enrollment in
       less challenging courses and increased probability of dropping out of school. The effects
       are not isolated to individual students -- research shows that achievement levels of both
       poor and non-poor students decline as poverty levels of schools increase.

Q.     What steps is the administration taking to address the impacts of poverty on
       academic performance?

      President Clinton's is calling on Congress for immediate funding for programs and new
      initiatives to help all children reach challenging academic standards, strengthen accountability,
      provide access to technology, improve the quality of teaching, expand Had Start and after
      school programs, and make our schools safe and drug free.We are targeting specific
      resources to better address the needs of students attending schools with high
      concentrations of poverty.

      Education Oooortunity Zones. President Clinton's Education Opportunity Zones
      initiative will strengthen public schools and help students master the basics where the
      need is the greatest: in high poverty urban and rural communities where low expectations,
      too many poorly prepared teachers, and overwhelmed school systems create significant
      barriers to high achievement. The Education Department will select approximately 50
      high poverty urban and rural school districts that agree to: (1) end social promotion and
      tum around failing schools; (2) prevent students from falling behind by ensuring quality
      teaching, challenging curricula, and extended learning time; and (3)use high standards
      and tests of student achievement to identify and provide help to students, teachers and
      schools who need it. The President's initiative will invest $200 million in FY99, and
      $1.5 billion over 5 years, to raise achievement and share lessons learned with school
      districts around the country.

      Title I (Education for the Disadvantaged). President Clinton is pushing Congress to fund
      the title I prograrn at the level in his budget request. Title I provides approximately $7.5
      billion in federal assistance to improve learning for students in economically
      disadvantaged communities who are at risk of educational failure. Resources are
      distributed to schools where needs are greatest -- and encourage the adoption of
      schoolwide programs to improve teaching and learning to help children master the basics.
       The House bill cuts the Presidents request for Title I by $392 million, denying additional
      help to nearly 520,000 students in high-poverty communities. The Senate bill adds $301
      million over FY 1998, but remains $91 million below the President's budget.

School Safety

Q.    Are these school-based partnerships grants new? And how are they different from
      other actions the President has recommended with regard to putting more law
      enforcement in schools?

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dwnp Conversion
     COPS School-Based Partnerships grant program. The President first highlighted the
     program in March, when the Justice Department announced the availability of the funds.
     The new initiative not only encourages partnerships between local police departments and
     schools, but also emphasizes using community policing principles to help prevent and
     combat school crime.

     The President has also called on Congress to pass legislation introduced by Representative
     James Maloney (D-CN) to help provide for the hiring of more school safety officers
     through the COPS program. The COPS Office has already provided funds for localities
     to hire school safety officers -- including Jonesboro, Arkansas which last month received a
     grant to hire 15 school safety officers.


Q.   What else is the Administration doing on school safety?

A.   In addition to continuing to challenge the Congress to pass his comprehensive youth
     violence strategy to address the overarching problem of juvenile crime, the President has
     taken many actions to address the safety of our nation's schools:

    White House Conference On School Safety.   In July, the President announced a White
     House Conference on School Safety, and proclaimed October 15, 1998, National School
     Safety Day. The White House Conference will be linked by satellite to communities and
     schools across the country, including those communities affected by the recent wave of
     school shootings.

    Early warning guide. Last month, the President released a guide he directed the
     Attorney General and Secretary of Education to develop -- for teachers and principals
     identify and respond to the early warning signs of troubled youth that can lead to school
     violence. Last week, copies were sent to every school in the country for the start of the
     school year.

    First Annual Report on School Safety. In December, the President called for the
     development of an Annual Report on School Safety, which will be released on School
     Safety Day, October 15. The report will include: an analysis of all existing national
     school crime data and an overview of state and local crime reporting; examples of schools
     and strategies that are successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and class
     disruption; actions that parents can take locally to combat school crime, including a local
     safety checklist; and resources available to schools and communities to help create safe,
     disciplined, and drug-free schools.

    Safe and Drug-Free Schools. President Clinton expanded the Drug-Free Schools Act into
     the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act ofl994, making violence prevention a key part of


                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
    99. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program provides support for violence and drug
    prevention programs to 97 of the nation's school districts.

   Zero Tolerance for Guns in Schools. In October 1994, President Clinton signed into law
    the Gun-Free Schools Act, and issued a Presidential Directive later that month to enforce
    "zero tolerance" for guns in schools -- if a student brings a gun to school, that student will
    be expelled for a year. In 1997, over 6,000 students were expelled for bringing guns to
    schools.

   School Uniforms. School uniforms have been found to be a promising strategy to reduce
    violence while promoting discipline and respect in school. Because of this, the Clinton
    Administration has encouraged schools to consider adopting school uniform policies by
    sharing with every school district a school uniforms manual prepared by the Department
    of Education in consultation with local communities and the Department of Justice.

   Cracking Down on Truancy.      Truancy prevention initiatives have been shown to keep
    more children in school and dramatically reduce daytime crime. The President, through
    the Education Department, issued a guidebook to the 15,000 school districts nationwide
    which outlines the central characteristics of a comprehensive truancy prevention policy
    and highlights model initiatives in cities and towns across the country.

I talked to Becky Blank who thinks the report is less far off than I think
it is.   She thinks the findings support extending FMLA and child care.
She'd like to come in and talk with you about the draft report and how we
might utilize the report.    She'll call your offices to try and set up a
meeting.
