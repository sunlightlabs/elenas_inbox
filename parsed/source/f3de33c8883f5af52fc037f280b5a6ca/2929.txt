 TEXT:
 Attached is an overivew of key education initiatives that have the
 greatest impact on urban areas and minorities -- in the context of a more
 universal education strategy.

 Shortly I will send you a companion piece that captures the condition of
 education for minorities -- showing that over the last 10-20 years, the
 gap in academic performance between whites and minorities in k-12
 education has closed considerably (thought the rate of improvement has
 slowed recently).   The picture is not as rosy with regard to postsecondary
 enrollment.==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

FR:            Mike Cohen

RE:            Education initiatives related to race and cities

I'm not sure this does the job, but here is an overView of what we have done in education that fits
Bruce's description this morning of addressing universal problems that have disproportionate
impact on minority groups.


I. Raising Academic Standards
The heart of the President's education reform effort over the past 5 years is raising expectatinos
and setting higher academic standards for all kids. This is especially important for
disadvantaged and minority students, who have typically suffered from what Secretary Riley calls
the "tyranny of low expectations" reflected in low standards, unchallenging expectations and low
level tests which have particularly characerizes urban education. The Administration has
worked to raise standards in a number of specific ways, including:.

      In 1994, President Clinton signed legislation transforming Title I, the largest federal
       elementary and secondary program, to require that disadvantaged students be taught to the
       same challenging academic standards used for all other students in the state--ending
       separate, minimal expectations for students served under Title 1.     The new law also
       puts a stronger emphasis on involving parents in their children's education, a critiCal
       aspect of improving student academic achievement.

      In 1994, the President signed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which supports state
       and local efforts to raise academic standards for all children.

      In 1996, the President won a record increase in Title I funding, assuring extra help in the
       basics and advanced subjects for an additional XXX disadvantaged students; and the
       budget agreement will help ensure strong funding of this key program for years to come.

      The President has called for increased funding to assist low-income high school students
       to take the challenging Advanced Placement exam in math and other core subjects.

II Getting Kids Off to a Good Start

      Betwen FY93 and FY97, President Clinton increased funding for Head Start by 43%,
       from $2.8 Billion in 93 to $4.0 in FY97. The FY98 budget proposed a $324 million
       increase, and is on track to serve 1 million children in 2002. The program now serves
       800,000 low income 3- and 4-year olds and their families.




                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

     The key to reaching high standards is mastering the basics, and the first basic is reading.
      Children who fall behind in learning to read in the early school years have a difficult time
      learning other subjects as they progress through school, and are more likely to drop out.
      The President has called for the entire nation to join a crusade to help insure that virtually
      every child in the U.S. can read by the end of 3rd grade.

     The budget agreement call for devoting 260 million in FY98 (and comparable amounts
      over five years) to a new literacy initiative consistent with the President's America Reads
      Initiative, which would mobilize one million skilled reading tutors to work with teachers
      and parents and help kids become independent readers.

IV. Access to Technology

     Technology is vitally important to helping students reach high standards and get ready for
      the 21 st Century. It's critical that technology not divide us into a nation of haves and
      have nots. While the biggest gap in access to computers is in the home, the President
      and the Vice President are deeply committed to working with our nation's schools to
      make sure that every child, no matter where they live or their economic circumstances,
      can log on to the Internet and take advantage of its rich possibilities for learning.

     Signed the Telecommunications Act and fought for the E-rate, which will allow Internet
      access discounts for schools and libraries. Discounts are on a sliding scale based on
      need, with poorest schools qualifying for a discount of up to 90%--nearly free.

     Working with private sector partners to connect every single school in each of the 15
      Empowerment Zones to the Internet, so they can leap ahead in technology.

     To receive grants under our Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, states must spell out
      how they will target assistance to communities with the highest rates of poverty and the
      greatest need for educational technology.

     As we have worked with the private sector on Net Days, have specifically urged them to
      get involved with low-income areas, such as in DC and LA. And we have worked to
      involve not just companies, but also unions and other volunteers.

V. Access to Higher Education and Further Learning

     The President has made an historic commitment to increasing the number of Americans,
      including minority Americans, who get a college education. He has increased the
      maximum Pell Grant 17% from FY93 to FY97 (from $2,300 to $2,700), increasing
      college opportunities to low income students. In addition, the balanced budget plan
      agreed to by the President and congressional leaders includes a record increase in the
      maximum Pell Grant, from $2,700 to $3,000 -- the largest increase in two decades.
