MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:          Jack Lew and Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:       Domestic Violence Waivers

This memo provides a brief overview of the domestic violence waiver amendment offered by
Senator Murray as it relates to the development of domestic violence waiver policy in the
proposed Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) regulations currently under review.

Current Law. Under current TANF law, a state may waive certain program requirements,
including time limits and work, for recipients in cases where the requirements would make it
harder for the recipients to escape domestic violence or would unfairly penalize persons who
have been victimized by domestic violence. These are known as good cause domestic violence
waivers. The law provides little guidance as to which requirements would unfairly penalize
domestic violence victims or what constitutes "good cause."

Murray Amendment. Senator Murray has proposed an Amendment that "clarifies" T ANF law
by providing: (1) that states not be subject to any numerical limitation in the granting of domestic
violence waivers, and (2) that HHS exclude all persons with domestic violence waivers in
determining a State's compliance with work participation rates and enforcement of the time limit.
This latter provision would more than likely increase significantly the number of TANF
recipients not affected by work requirements or time limits, and would allow states an out from
having to provide services necessary for domestic violence victims to gain employment.

Analysis. During negotiations this past summer, in which this issue received considerable
attention, some welfare analysts argued that as many as 50% of women (especially) on welfare
are battered, and should not have to work because of this and should not be subject to time limits.
 While we believe work activities and services are a way for battered women to get help, others
seem to believe that domestic violence waivers are critical to "protect" women from work
requirements and time limits.

A State's work participation rate -- which must be at least 30% in FY98 in order to avoid a
penalty -- is calculated by dividing the number ofTANF recipients who are engaged in a work
activity for the requisite number of hours per week by the total number of recipients. The
Murray Amendment would allow a State that fails to meet its work requirement to add to this
calculation the total number of domestic violence waiver recipients. This change could
effectively "gut" the work requirement.

With respect to the 5-year time limit, under current law states are permitted to give 20% of their
caseloads a hardship exemption to the time limit. The Murray Amendment would allow a state
to exceed this 20% exemption rate by the number of individuals who have received domestic
 violence waivers. Given current estimates on the number of welfare retIP'i~1Mi~life>~tims
 of domestic violence, this provision has the potential to double, or even triple, the 20% hardship
 exemption.

 Family Violence Option policy in the Proposed Rule. Through the regulatory process, we are
 attempting to clarify the domestic violence option without damaging the work or time limit
 requirements, which the President has made clear are very important to him. To ensure that
 victims of domestic violence are provided real services, we have pushed for the following in the
 proposed rule:

       that domestic violence waivers (1) be based on an individualized assessment, (2) have
        limited duration and (3) be accompanied by an appropriate services plan designed to
        provide safety and lead to work -- these provisions should prevent states from seeking
        excessive waivers

       that a State be excused from a penalty for failing to meet its work participation rate if the
        State meets the rate for the part of its T ANF population that has not been granted
        domestic violence waivers                                                     .

       that a State not be pennitted to exceed the 20% hardship exemption to the 5-year time
        limit, despite the number of domes* violence waivers it has granted.

 The HHS position currently differs from the EXOP position only on this last bullet point.
 We are currently working with HHS on a middle ground position, which provides states with
 some flexibility to exceed the 20% limit on an individual by individual basis, but which prevents
 states from substantial and unwarranted increases in the number of individuals granted waivers
 from.the 5-year time limit. ,This approach is largely supported by the fact that domestic violence
 waivers are supposed to be temporary and accompanied by services.

  Both OMB and DPC believe that the proposed rule we are working on with HHS will result in a
  fair application of the domestic violence option. We believe it is critical that real services be
  provided to victims of domestic violence and that states not be penalized for providing these
. specialized services, but also that states not be given loopholes to escape work requirements or
  time limits.

 Despite our efforts to address Senator Murray's concerns, we do not expect that she will be
 satisfied with any proposal that falls short of her Amendment.
