      Saving Social Security First, Protecting Patient Rights, Investing in
 Education and the Environment, Stabilizing International Financial System
                                                September 3,1998


         President Clinton's economic strategy of fiscal discipline, strategic investments in our
         people, and opening markets abroad has helped create the strongest economy in a generation
         and will deliver the first budget surplus in three decades. Now is a time to build on our
         success and there is much work for Congress to do in the weeks before adjournment.
         President Clinton, working with the Congress, is determined to:

         _   Save Social Security First -- The President will fight any attempt to break the budget
                     rules and drain the surplus. His commitment is unwavering: every penny of
                     any future surplus must be reserved until a bipartisan plan to save Social
                     Security is enacted.

             Pass a Patients' Bill of Rights -- The President will work to pass a strong enforceable
                     patients' bill of rights to give Americans the protections they deserve.

             Invest in Education -- The President will work to strengthen public schools through
                      higher standards, expanded opportunities, increased accountability, school
                      modernization and smaller classes, and greater access to technology.

             Invest in a Cleaner Environment -- President Clinton will push his significant new
                      investments to curb water pollution, clean up toxic dumps, protect precious
                      lands, and combat global warming.

         _   Stabilize the International Financial System -- The President will work to provide the
                      International Monetary Fund (IMF) the resources it needs to protect the
                      international financial system -- and therefore the United States economy.


Save Social Security First
Fiscal discipline has helped create the strongest economy in a generation. In 1992, the deficit stood at a record
$290 billion and was projected by CBO to exceed $350 billion this year. The President's 1993 Economic Plan
helped cut the deficit, lowered interest rates, spurred business investment, and strengthened the economy. With
last year's bipartisan Balanced Budget, the President finished the job of balancing the budget and this year we
will record the first budget surplus in 29 years. With our fiscal house is in order, we must use our solid fiscal
footing to face the next major fiscal challenge: the retirement of the baby boom generation. This is why, in his
State of the Union in January, President Clinton proposed that every penny of the surplus be reserved to "Save
Social Security First."
Building on his tax cutting record, the President has called on Congress to pass targeted tax relief -- to spur
school modernization, help families better afford child-care, help clean the environment, expand pension
coverage, and develop low-income housing. The President insists that every tax cut and new spending program
meet the budget rules and be fully paid for. He will strongly oppose any proposal that breaks the budget rules
and drains the surplus. As the President has said:
     HI believe we should tell our children and our grandchildren that we think enough of them and their future
    that we're going to resist spending a penny of the surplus on things that I would very much like to spend it
    on -- or you would -- until we have met our basic obligation to our future, passing a bipartisan plan to save

Pass A Patients' Bill of Rights
President Clinton calls on the Congress to pass a strong, enforceable patients' bill of rights that assures
Americans the quality health care they need. This bill should include important patient protections such as:
          Assuring direct access to specialists.
          Real emergency room protections.
          Continuity of care provisions that protect patients from abrupt changes in treatment.
          A fair, timely, and independent appeals process for patient grievances.
          Enforcement provisions to make these rights real.
The President has urged the Senate Leadership to make passing the patients' bill of rights the first order of
business this fall. The Republicans have proposed legislation that would be more loophole than law. Their
proposals cover too few people; provide too few patient protections; and contain unnecessary and
irrelevant provisions that undermine the chances for a bipartisan agreement on a patients' bill of rights.
 For example, these proposals would let HMOs, not informed health professionals, define medical necessity
and would fail to guarantee direct access to specialists.
The President is working to implement patients' bill of rights in health plans under Federal jurisdiction.
                                                                                                   In
February, the President issued an Executive Memorandum directing all Federal health plans to come into
compliance with the patients' bill of rights. In response to this directive, for example:
    _ Department of Health and Human Services has extended the patients' bill of rights to the 40 million
      Americans who receive Medicare.
    _ Department of Veterans' Affairs has begun to put in place a new, rapid appeals process for its 3 million
      beneficiaries. The Department of Defense issued a directive to all military bases throughout the world,
      extending patient protections to 8 million servicemen and women and their families.
    _ Department of Labor is requiring plans it oversees to have an improved internal appeals process.

Invest in Education
President Clinton is working to strengthen public education by raising standards, increasing accountability and
expanding public school choice, including charter schools, and to prepare students for the 21 st Century through
increased investments in public schools, expanded awareness of and access to higher education, and training to
ensure success in the workplace.
   Strengthening Public Education. President Clinton will fight for full funding for programs and new
    initiatives that will help all children reach challenging academic standards, strengthen accountability,
    provide access to technology, improve the quality of teaching, expand Head Start and after school
    programs, and make our schools safe and drug free.
   Modernizing Our Schools. The President is calling for federal tax credits to help renovate, modernize,
    and build over 5,000 public schools nationwide.
   Reduce Class Size. The President will press Congress to enact his proposal to reduce class size to a
    national average of 18 in grades 1-3, by helping local schools hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers.
   Expanding Investments In Youth Education And Training. One of the President's top priorities is
    fighting efforts by Congress to eliminate both the Summer Jobs Program, which provides jobs to roughly
    530,000 disadvantaged young people, and the new Youth Opportunity Area Initiative, which would help
    provide job training and help finding jobs for up to 50,000 youth in the poorest communities nationwide.
   Passage Of The Higher Education Act, With The High Hopes Mentoring Initiative and Teacher
    Recruitment. President Clinton urges Congress to pass the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act,
    to reduce interest rates on student loans; extend the Pell Grant and Federal Work-Study programs; enact his
    High Hopes program to establish college-school partnerships in order to spark young people's interest in
"
    strengthen teacher training and recruitment programs.                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
   Education Technology. The President has made an unprecedented commitment to bringing
    technology into the classroom and called for technology training for teachers and expanded access
    for teachers and students to computers in the classroom; however, the House appropriations biII
    threatens these initiatives;
   Strengthening And Expanding Charter Schools. President Clinton will continue to work with Congress
    to pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen federal support for the growing charter school movement.
   Helping Every Eight-Year Old Learn To Read. President Clinton will continue his work with Congress
    to enact a child literacy bill to ensure that children receive quality instruction from well-trained teachers and
    have opportunities to develop their reading skills with trained tutors after-school and on the weekend.
   Voluntary National Standards and Tests. President Clinton will continue to fight for voluntary national
    standards and tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math, to help students master the basic skills and to
    give parents, communities and educators accurate information on how well our students perform.

Invest in a Cleaner Environment
President Clinton is proposing significant new investments to curb water pollution, clean up toxic dumps,
protect precious lands, and combat global warming. Yet the Republican Congress is not only failing to fully
fund these priorities, but is launching a stealth attack on the environment with a host oflegislative riders aimed
at rolling back protections already in place.
   Clean, Safe Water for America. The President is proposing an additional $2.3 billion over five years to
    help clean up the almost 40 percent of America's surveyed waterways still too polluted for fishing or
    swimming. Budget bills in the House and Senate fall well short of the President's request, denying
    communities and farmers vital help in curbing pollution.
   Saving and Restoring Parks and Other Natural Treasures. The President is proposing a 43 percent
    increase over five years to acquire scenic and historic lands, yet Congress is denying full funding. What's
    more, Congress is withholding 1998 appropriations that the President has allocated to protect over 100 sites
    in 35 states, including Civil War battlefields, critical winter range for Yellowstone bison, New Mexico's
    Baca Ranch, and completion of the Appalachian Trail.
   Leading the Fight Against Global Warming. The President's five-year $6.3 billion package of tax
    incentives and research investment would reduce greenhouse gas pollution through energy efficiency and
    clean energy technologies. But Congress, ignoring the growing evidence of global warming, wants to cut
    these sensible, cost-effective programs.
   Doubling the Pace of Toxic Cleanups. The President is proposing an additional $650 million in Fiscal
    Year 99 -- a 40 percent increase -- to accelerate Superfund cleanups with a goal of completing a total of 900
    cleanups by 200 I. By denying these funds, Congress threatens to delay cleanup at up to 171 sites.
   Fighting Against Stealth Attacks on the Environment. Some of the many anti-environmental riders
    would force overcutting of timber on national forests, cripple wildlife protection efforts, deny taxpayers a
    fair return from oil leasing on public lands, and allow a $30 million road through an Alaska wildlife refuge.
    The President will not tolerate stealth tactics that do unacceptable harm to the environment or threaten
    public health.
Stabilize the International Financial System
Driven by a return to fiscal strength, the United States' economy is the strongest it has been in a generation.
Unemployment and inflation are at their lowest levels in decades. Some other nations around the world,
however, are experiencing major economic upheaval and this has already hurt our exports and farmers.
A strong International Monetary Fund is a stabilizing force in the world economy and is vital to protect
the international financial system -- and therefore the U.S. economy -- against the risk of new, escalating,
to include any such funding. President Clinton will fight for full funding for the IMF to help keep our
economy strong.
