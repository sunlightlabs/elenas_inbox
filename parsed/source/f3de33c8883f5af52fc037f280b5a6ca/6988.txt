RE:    PRIVACY IN THE INFORMATION AGE

I. What's the problem?

        In recent years, Americans have become increasingly coqcerned about their privacy. In a
recent Louis Harris poll, eight out often Americans surveyed agreed that "consumers have lost
all control over how personal information about them is circulated and used by companies."

        Clearly, new technologies have made it easier to create, manipulate, store, transmit, and
link digital personally identifiable information. People may disclose personal information
about themselves as they travel,fill a prescription at the drug store, visit a Web site, call a 1-800
number, send an e-mail, use a credit card, or purchase groceries using a discount card.
Information about these individual transactions may be bought and sold - and companies are now
assembling giant "data warehouses" that contain electronic dossiers on the needs, lifestyles, and
spending habits of millions of Americans.

       Concerns about the loss of privacy are not just hypothetical:

      Early this year, the Navy began discharge proceedings against a sailor (McVeigh) on the
       basis of personal information he disclosed on America Online. The Navy investigator
       was able to get AOL to disclose information that linked Mr.McVeigh's screen name to his
       real identity.

      The drug store CVS and Giant Food recently admitted that they were disclosing patient
       prescription records to a direct mail and pharmaceutical company to track customers who
       don't refill prescriptions.

      Beverly Dennis, a women in Massillion, Ohio, received a 12-page letter containing an
       intimately threatening sexual fantasy from a stranger who knew her birthday, the names
       of her favorite magazines, the fact that she was divorced, and the kind of soap she used in
       the shower. The letter was written by a convicted rapist serving time in a Texas state
       prison, who had been entering information for Metromail, a direct marketing firm with
       detailed databases on more than 90 percent of American households. Dennis' suit
       disclosed that Metromail had 900 pieces of information on her going back to 1987,
       including not only her income, marital status, hobbies, ailments, but whether she had


                                                 1
                                                              Hex텱ump Conversion

       dentures, the brands of antacid tablets she had taken, and how often she had used room
       deodorizers, sleeping aids, and hemorrhoid remedies.

       Privacy concerns often have to be balanced against other competing values - such as
prevention of crime, prosecution of criminals, cracking down on "deadbeat dads," free
expression, and an investigatory press. For example:

      When information is true and obtained lawfully, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled
       that the state may not restrict its publication without showing a narrowly tailored and
       compelling governmental interest.

      Although the widespread adoption of strong encryption would increase privacy, the U.S.
       has maintained export controls against unbreakable encryption because of national
       security and law enf0rcement concerns.

      There are significant commercial advantages that flow from the collection of personally
       identifiable information. As privacy expert Fred Cate put it, "Instant credit, better
       targeted mass mailings, lower insurance rates, faster service when ordering merchandise
       by telephone, special recognition for frequent travelers, and countless other benefits come
       only at the expense of some degree of privacy."

II. What is the current U.S. legal regime?

        The U.S. has no comprehensive privacy law. Instead, the United States has a series of
laws that often cover a specific industry or economic sector, or a specific use of some class of
data. Many of these laws are significantly qualified by exemptions. Current statutes cover
areas such as: the federal government's collection of personal information; "matching" of
computerized federal records; consumer credit reports; driver's records; interception and
disclosure of electronic communications; video tape rentals and sales; telecommunications
services; and educational records.

       Critics of the U.S. approach believe that it results in a "patchwork of uneven,
inconsistent, and often irrational privacy protection ... information about a person's video rentals
receives considerable statutory protection; information about medical condition and treatment
does not." Defenders believe that a sectoral approach makes sense because it is difficult to
develop a "one size fits all" policy -- given the different risks involved in the disclosure of
personal information and the different interests that need to be balanced.

III. What is current Administration policy?

Privacy principles

       In 1995, the Administration, as part of its "National Information Infrastructure" initiative,


                                                 2
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
 released its "Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information." The Privacy Principles
are designed to apply to the collection and use of information by both government and industry,
and draw on existing international fair information practices such as the OECD guidelines.

         The Privacy Principles call on those who gather and use personal information to
recognize and respect the privacy interest that individuals have in personal information by (1)
assessing the impact on privacy in deciding whether to obtain or use personal information; and,
(2) obtaining and keeping only information that could be reasonably expected to support current
or planned activities. Data gatherers should use the information only for those current or planned
activities or for compatible purposes.

        Because individuals need to be able to make informed decisions about providing personal
information, the organizations that collect information should disclose: (1) why they are
collecting the information; (2) for what purposes they expect to use the information; (3) what
steps will be taken to protect the confidentiality, quality and integrity of information collected;
(4) the consequences of providing or withholding information; and (5) any rights of redress that
are available to individuals for wrongful or inaccurate disclosure of their information.

       In July 1997, the President released the Administration's "Framework for Global
Electronic Commerce." The Framework stated that the "private efforts of industry working in
cooperation with consumer groups are preferable to government regulation, but if effective
privacy protection cannot be provided in this way, we will reevaluate this policy." The
Secretary of Commerce must report to the President in July 1998 on the progress that has been
made on industry self-regulation to protect privacy.

Medical records

       It is not the Administration's position that industry self-regulation is adequate in all
instances. On September 1997, HHS Secretary Shalala called for federal legislation on medical
records consistent with the following principles:

      A prohibition on the disclosure of patient-identifiable information except
       as authorized by the patient or as explicitly permitted by the legislation (exceptions for
       public health, research, law enforcement, and oversight ofthe health care system).

      Provide consumers with significant new rights to be informed about how their health
       information will be used and who has seen that information.

      Punishment for those who misuse personal health information and redress for
       people who are harmed by its misuse.


IV. What is the U.S.-EU dimension ofthe privacy issue?


                                                 3
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion 

       The United States and the European Union have significiantly different approaches to
privacy. The EU has adopted a Directive on Data Protection, which becomes effective in
October 1998. One provision of the Directive prohibits transfer of personal information to other
countries that lack "adequate" protection of privacy. If the EU were to rule that the U.S. does
not provide "adequate protection" of privacy - it could significantly reduce the flow of data
between the U.S. and Europe and disrupt trade and the operations of U.S. firms doing business in
Europe.

       The EU Directive is different from the U.S. approach because it:

      Covers all sectors and is extraordinarily broad;

      Requires that anyone that is processing personal data register with national authorities
       before beginning any data processing; and

      Requires member states to establish an independent public authority that can wield
       investigatory powers, hear complaints, order the cessation of data processing activities,
       block the transfer of data to third parties, and impose penalties.

         Some analysts believe that the EU Directive is so broad that it will make routine behavior
illegal (e.g. a salesperson who enters names on a laptop without someone's unambigious consent
and leaves the country) -- and that the EU can not possibly enforce the letter of the law.

       It is not yet clear whether the EU would regard a   U.S~   industry-led initiative to strengthen
privacy protection as "adequate."

V. What are some potential options to strengthen the privacy of Americans?


Option A. Derme what effective industry self-regulation is -- promote efforts by the private
sector to achieve effective self-regulation.

        The Commerce Department has developed a set of criteria for judging whether or not a
self-regulatory regime is effective that it plans to publish in the Federal Register for comment.
These criteria include support for the key fair information principles discussed above, and
enforcement mechanisms, including:

      Consumer recourse for resolution of disputes.

      Verification that the assertions businesses make about their privacy practices are true and
       that privacy practices have been implemented as represented.
      Consequences. For self-regulation to be effective, failure to comply with fair information
       practices should have consequences (e.g. cancellation of the right to use a certifying seal


                                                 4
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

         or logo, posting the name of the non-complier on a publicly available "bad-actor" list,
         disqualification from membership in an industry trade association, liability for fraud),

         A coalition of U.S. businesses, lead by IBM, proposes to create a self-regulatory umbrella
group to promote compliance with fair information practices on the Internet that the Commerce
Department believes is consistent with its principles, The group intends to "preview" the
initiative in May (at the DOC privacy event), with a commitment to begin operations in
September, 1998. At this point, the composition of the alliance has not gelled. We understand
that AT&T, EDS, Hewlett-Packard, and a number of other businesses are in discussion with
IBM.

         A longer description of the private sector initiative is attached,

Option B. Establish a "privacy entity" within the federal government.

       One criticism ofthe U.S. privacy policy is that there is no part of the government that has
privacy as its primary mission. A privacy entity within the federal government could have a
number of functions, including:

        Representational: Explain and promote the U.S. government position on privacy policy
         domestically and internationally.

        Advisory: Provide technical assistance to privacy policy questions raised by government
         agencies and by private sector entities.

        Coordination: Apprise appropriate government agencies of emerging privacy issues and
         ensure that these issues are addressed

        Regulatory/enforcement: Create and administer legally enforceable regimes of fair
         information practices including the use of some combination of inspection, registration,
         reporting, civil or criminal action, adjudication, and penalties. [Note that this would be
         inconsistent with Administration policy to date.]

        Ombudsman: Case-by-case assistance to consumers or businesses in resolving in
         response to their particular problems or complaints.

        Education: Provide privacy information (including model practices and "rights and
         responsibilities") to citizens, industry, and government.

        Consumer Advocacy: Monitor privacy policies that affect consumers and promoting
         improvements through public appearances, media presence, writing to organizations
         about whom complaints are received, and involvement in litigation,



                                                   5
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion .
      Evaluation: A policy advocacy role (as contrasted with a consumer advocacy or
       ombudsman role) to give opinions, promote good ideas and practices, and scrutinize less
       good ones.

       After deciding what functions the "privacy entity" would carry out -- the Administration
would have to decide where to put it. A longer discussion of the proposed functions of a
"privacy entity" is attached.
