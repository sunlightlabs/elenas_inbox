                        December 27,1997

Today, President Clinton announced that starting January 1, Medicare will cover a host of new
preventive benefits for the program's 39 million beneficiaries. These new benefits will:
guarantee affordable coverage for annual mammograms for all Medicare beneficiaries over forty;
provide regular pap smears and pelvic exams; and guarantee regular colorectal cancer screening.
This builds on the annual flu and pneumonia vaccine campaign kicked off this October. The
President also announced that new benefits to detect osteoporosis and improve education and
care for people with diabetes will become effective in July. All of these are benefits the
President advocated for in the Balanced Budget Act he signed into law earlier this year. The
new preventive benefits starting January 1 include:

Making Mammography Screening More Affordable. Medicare will waive the deductible for
mammograms, making annual screenings more affordable. Despite the fact that mammography
screening can significantly reduce mortality rates, about half of women over 65. have not had a
mammogram in the past two years. Studies show that costs are the most significant reason
women do not get mammograms. Although Medicare has covered mammography screening since
1991, only 14 of eligible beneficiaries without supplemental "Medigap" insurance, which often
helps offset the cost of screening, receive mammograms.

Guaranteeing Annual Coverage of Mammography for All Women Over Forty. Medicare
will now cover annual screening mammography for women age 40 and o~er. Previously,
Medicare covered mammograms only every other year for some age groups and not at all for
others. This new change ensures that all Medicare-eligible women are covered for yearly
mammograms. It also makes Medicare consistent with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI)
recent recommendations that women over forty should undergo regular mammography
screemng.

Helping Women Prevent Cervical Cancer. Medicare is also expanding coverage to pay for
screening pap smear and pelvic exams every three years and annually for women who are at risk
for this type of cancer. Medicare will cover lab tests, annual deductibles, and the clinical breast
exams that frequently accompany these services. Survival rates for cervical cancer are almost
100%, when detected in the earliest stages and followed by appropriate services. In some areas,
up to 75% of women have not had a pap smear in the last 5 years.

Preventing and Detecting Colorectal Cancer. For the first time ever, Medicare will now
cover regular colorectal cancer screening tests. Under current law, these screening tests are only
covered when patients have symptoms that indicate they may have cancer or another disease.
Colorectal cancer is second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, causing over 54,000 deaths
each year. When diagnosed in localized stages, survival rates for colorectal cancer is over 90%,
but when detected in advanced stages, these rates drop to 7%. However, only 37% of colorectal
cancer is diagnosed at the localized, more treatable stage.

Helping Older Women Detect Osteoporosis. Medicare will clarify that it covers bone density
measurement for beneficiaries at risk for osteoporosis and other bone abnonnalities. Osteoporosis is a
disabling condition resulting in more than 1.3 million fractures per year, affecting 25% of older women.
These fractures,which are frequently hip fractures, can be quite devastating. For individuals
functionally independent and living at home at the time of a hip fracture, 15% to 25% will require
long-term institutional care and 25% to 30% will return home but need help with daily living activities.

Educating Beneficiaries With Diabetes To Better Manage Their Care. For the first time, Medicare will
cover self-management training offered by physicians and other certified providers rather than only in
hospital-based programs. This new benefit will help ensure that more beneficiaries with diabetes
manage their disease, thereby helping to prevent the debilitating and costly complications too often
associated with the disease. More than 3 million Medicare beneficiaries suffer from diabetes. People
with diabetes are 2 to 4 times more likely to suffer from heart disease and 2 to 4 times more likely to
suffer from strokes. Diabetes also accounts for 36 of new ERSD cases (kidney disease) -- about
20,000 cases each year, which is covered by Medicare.

Helping Beneficiaries Reduce the Long-Term Consequences of Diabetes. Medicare will now make blood
glucose monitors (including testing strips) available to all beneficiaries with diabetes. Medicare currently
covers only insulin-dependent patients. By monitoring their glucose levels, patients will improve
treatment and iive beneficiaries the infonnation necessary to control their disease.

THESE NEW PREVENTIVE BENEFITS ARE ONLY ONE ASPECT OF RECENT
IMPROVEMENTS IN MEDICARE. The recent balanced budget passed by Congress, contained many
of the President's proposal to strengthen and modernize the prowam including:

      Extending the life of the Medicare Trust Fund until at least 2010;

      Modernizing Medicare by including new market-oriented reforms that have proved
       successful in the private sector such as: (1) giving beneficiaries more choices in health plans,
       including Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Provider Sponsored Organizations
       (PSOs); (2) implementing new payment refonns to provide incentives for hospitals, home health
       proivders, and nursing homes not to overbill; and (3) providing incentives for rural communities
       to provide more choices of health plans for Medicare beneficiaries.

      Ensuring New Premium Protections for Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries. The budget
       agreement invests $1.5 billion over five years to pay the premiums for beneficiaries up to 135% of
       poverty. Beneficiaries as high as 185% of poverty will also get assistance.

      Fighting Fraud and Waste in Medicare. Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has
       assigned more federal prosecutors and FBI agents to fight health care fraud than ever
       before. As a result, convictions have gone up a full 240% saving more than $20 billion in

keep scam artists and fly-by-night health care out of Medicare and Medicaid. Most recently
the President proposed legislation to stop the Medicare program from overpaying for the drugs it
covers, and imposed an unprecedented moratorium to prevent bad apple providers out of the home
health industry.
