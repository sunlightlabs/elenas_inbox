FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      OCTOBER 20, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Two lawsuits have now been filed -- and a third is planned -- challenging
the constitutionality of the line-item veto.   Lawsuits were filed Oct. 16
by New York City and the National Treasury Employees Union, and a third
lawsuit is being planned by farm cooperatives.   New York City is
challenging item veto of the Medicaid provider tax provision; NTEU is
challenging veto of the CSRS-FERS open season; and the farm coops will
argue that veto of the farmers coop provision in the Taxpayer Relief Act
was unconstitutional and, alternatively, that the provision was not a
D&limited tax benefitD8 as defined by the Item Veto Act.   The cooperatives
plan to file a motion to join its lawsuit with the one filed by New York
City.
