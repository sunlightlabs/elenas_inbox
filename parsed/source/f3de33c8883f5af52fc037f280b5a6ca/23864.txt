5/12/99                   CLINTON-GORE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
                               REFORMING WELFARE


          On August 22. 1996. President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work
          Opportunity Reconciliation Act. fulfilling his longtime commitment to 'end welfare as we
          know it. ' As the President said upon signing. "... this legislation provides an historic
          opportunity to end welfare as we know it and transform our broken welfare system by
          promoting the fundamental values of work. responsibility. and family. ..


                        TRANSFORMING THE BROKEN WELFARE SYSTEM

          Overhauling the Welfare System with the Personal Responsibility Act: In 1996, the
          President signed a bipartisan welfare plan that is dramatically changing the nation's welfare
          system into one that requires work in exchange for time-limited assistance. The law
          contains strong work requirements, performance bonuses to reward states for moving welfare
          recipients into jobs and reducing illegitimacy, state maintenance of effort requirements,
          comprehensive child support enforcement, and supports for families moving from welfare to
          work -- including increased funding for child care. State strategies are making a real
          difference in the success of welfare reform, specifically in job placement, child care and
          transportation. In April 1999, the President unveiled landmark new welfare regulations that
          will promote work and help those who have left the rolls to succeed in the workforce and stay
          off welfare.

          Law Builds on the Administration's Welfare Reform Strategy: Even before the Personal
          Responsibility Act became law, many states were well on their way to changing their welfare
          programs to jobs programs. By granting federal waivers, the Clinton Administration
          allowed 43 states -- more than all previous Administrations combined -- to require work,
          time-limit assistance, make work pay, improve child support enforcement, or encourage
          parental responsibility. The vast majority of states have chosen to build on their welfare
          demonstration projects approved by the Administration.

          Welfare Rolls Decline as More Recipients go to Work: In April 1999, the President
          released state-by-state data (from December 1998) showing that welfare caseloads are at their
          lowest level in 30 years and that the welfare rolls have fallen by nearly half since he took
          office. Since January 1993, 29 states have had case/oad declines of more than half and
          nationwide the rolls have fallen by 46 , from 14.1 million to 7.6 million. This historic
          decline occurred in response to the Administration's grants of federal waivers to 43 states, the
          provisions of the new welfare reform law, and the strong economy. Information released
          by the Department of Health and Human Services also shows that the percentage of welfare
          recipients working has tripled since 1992, that an estimated 1.5 million people who were on
          welfare in 1997 were working in 1998, and that all states met the first overall work
          participation rates required under the welfare reform law.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion .

                       MOVING PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

    Mobilizing the Business Community: At the President's urging, the Welfare-to-Work
    Partnership was launched in May 1997 to lead the national business effort to hire people from
    the welfare rolls. The Partnership began with 105 participating businesses, and in his 1999
    State of the Union address, the President announced that the Partnership has grown to more
    than 10,000 businesses. Since 1997, these businesses have hired over 410,000 welfare
    recipients, surpassing the challenge the President set in May of 1998. The Partnership
    provides technical assistance and support to businesses around the country, including: its
    toll-free number 1-888-USA-JOB 1, a web site, a quarterly newsletter, and a "Blueprint for
    Business" hiring manual. The Partnership also published "The Road to Retention," a report
    of companies that have found higher retention rates for former welfare recipients than for
    other new hires, and strategies they used to achieve this success.

    Connecting Small Businesses with New Workers and Creating New Entrepreneurs: The
    Small Business Administration is addressing the unique and vital role of small businesses
    who employ over one-half of the private workforce, by helping small businesses throughout
    the country connect with job training organizations and job-ready welfare recipients. In
    addition, SBA provides training and assistance to welfare recipients who wish to start their
    own businesses. SBA provides assistance to businesses through its 1-800-U-ASK-SBA
    number, as well through its network of small business development and women's business
    centers, one-stop capital shops, Senior Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) chapters,
    district offices, and its website.

   Mobilizing Civic, Religious and Non-profit Groups: Vice President Gore created the
    Welfare-to-Work Coalition to Sustain Success, a coalition of national civic, service, and
    faith-based groups committed to helping former welfare recipients succeed in the workforce.
    Working in partnership with public agencies and employers, Coalition members provide
    mentoring, job training, child care, transportation, and other support to help these new
    workers with the transition to self sufficiency. Charter members of the Coalition include:
    Alpha Kappa Alpha, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Baptist Joint Committee,
    Goodwill, Salvation Army, the United Way, Women's Missionary Union, the YMCA, the
    YWCA, and other civic and faith-based groups.

   Doing Our Fair Share with the Federal Government's Hiring Initiative: Under the
    Clinton/Gore Administration, the federal workforce is the smallest it has been in thirty years.
    Yet, this Administration also believes that the federal government, as the nation's largest
    employer, must lead by example. In March 1997, the President asked the Vice President to
    oversee the federal government's hiring initiative in which federal agencies committed to
    directly hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients in the next four years. In April 1999, the
    President announced that the federal government has hired 12,000 welfare recipients, meeting
    the goal nearly two years ahead of schedule. As a part of this effort, the White House
    pledged to hire six welfare recipients and has already exceeded this goal.

   Funds to Help Move More People from Welfare to Work: Because of the President's
    leadership, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act included $3 billion for Welfare-to-W ork grants to


                                                2
                                                                           Hex-Dump Con'le:aion
    help states and local communities move long-term welfare recipients, and certain
    non-custodial parents, into lasting, unsubsidized jobs. These funds can be used for job
    creation, job placement and job retention efforts, including wage subsidies to private
    employers and other critical post-employment support services. The Department of Labor
    provides oversight, but most of the dollars are placed through the Private Industry Councils,
    in the hands of the localities who are on the front lines of the welfare reform effort. In
    addition, 25% of the funds are awarded by the Department of Labor on a competitive basis to
    support innovative we1fare-to-work projects. The President announced the first round of 49
    competitive grants in May,and the Vice President announced the second round of75
    competitive grants in November 1998. In January 1999, the Department of Labor
    announced the availability of $240 million in competitive grants for FY 1999. These funds
    will support innovative local welfare-to-work strategies for noncustodial parents, individuals
    with limited English proficiency, disabilities, substance abuse problems, or a history of
    domestic violence.
    The President's FY 2000 Budget requests $1 billion to extend the Welfare-to-Work program
    to help 200,000 long-term welfare recipients and noncustodial parents in high-poverty areas
    move into lasting unsubsidized employment. The initiative would provide at least $150
    million to ensure that every state helps fathers fulfill their responsibilities by working, paying
    child support, and playing a responsible part in their children's lives. Under this proposal,
    states and communities would use a minimum of 20% of their formula funds to provide job
    placement and job retention assistance to low-income fathers who sign personal
    responsibility contracts committing them to work and pay child support. This effort would
    further increase child support collections, which have risen 80% since the President took
    office, from $8 billion in 1992 to $14.4 billion in 1998. Remaining funds will go toward
    assisting long-term welfare recipients with the greatest barriers to employment to move into
    lasting jobs. The reauthorized program also would double the Welfare-to-Work funding
    available for tribes.

   Tax Credits for Employers: The We1fare-to-Work Tax Credit, enacted in the 1997
    Balanced Budget Act, provides a credit equal to 35% of the first $10,000 in wages in the first
    year of employment, and 50% of the first $10,000 in wages in the second year, to encourage
    the hiring and retention oflong term welfare recipients. This credit complements the Work
    Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides a credit of up to $2,400 for the first year of wages
    for eight groups of job seekers. The Omnibus Budget Act of 1998 included an extension
    through June 30, 1999 and the President's FY 2000 Budget proposes to extend both credits
    for an additional year.

   Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers: In 1999, the President proposed and Congress
    approved $283 million for 50,000 new housing vouchers for welfare recipients who need
    housing assistance to get or keep a job. Families will use these welfare-to-work housing
    vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable
    housing that will eliminate emergencies which keep them from getting to work every day on
    time. Nearly all of these vouchers will be awarded to communities on a competitive basis, to
    communities that create cooperative efforts among their housing, welfare and employment
    agencies. The President's FY 2000 Budget provides $430 million for 75,000
    welfare-to-work housing vouchers, including $144 million in new funds for 25,000 additional


                                                      3
                                                                                Hex-Dump ConvciSioil
        vouchers.
       Welfare-to-Work Transportation: One of the biggest barriers facing people who move
        from welfare to work -- in cities and in rural areas -- is finding transportation to jobs, training
        programs and child care centers. Few welfare recipients own cars. Existing mass transit
        does not provide adequate links to many suburban jobs at all, or within a reasonable
        commute time. In addition, many jobs require evening or weekend hour~ that are poorly
        served by existing transit routes. To help those on welfare get to work, President Clinton
        proposed a $100 million a year welfare-to-work transportation plan as part of his ISTEA
        reauthorization bill. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21)
        authorized $750 million over five years for the President's Job Access initiative and reverse
        commute grants. Of this amount, $50 million is guaranteed funding in FY 1999, rising to
        $150 million in 2003. The Omnibus Budget Act included $75 million for this program in
        FY 1999, and in May, Vice President Gore awarded $71 million of these funds to 179
        communities in 42 states around the country. The President's Budget proposes to double
        funding for FY 2000, bringing the program to the authorized level of $150 million. The Job
        Access competitive grants will assist states and localities in developing flexible
        transportation alternatives, such as van services, for welfare recipients and other low income
        workers.


                               SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES

        Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit: Expansions in the EITC included in the
        President's 1993 Economic Plan are making work pay for 15 million working families,
        including former welfare recipients. A study conducted by the Council of Economic
        Advisors reported that in 1997, the EITC lifted 4.3 million American out of poverty -- more
        than double the number in 1993. The findings also suggest that the increase in labor force
        participation among single mothers who received welfare is strongly linked to the EITC
        expansion.

       Improving Access to Affordable and Quality Child Care: Under the Clinton Administration,
        federal funding for child care has increased by 70 , helping parents pay for the care of about
        one million children. The 1996 welfare reform law increased child care funding by $4
        billion over six years to provide child care assistance to families moving from welfare to work.

        The President's budget proposes to expand the Child Care and Development Block Grant to
        help working families struggling to meet the costs of child care. The President's proposal:
        (1) increases funding for child care subsidies by $7.5 billion over five years, and these new
        funds, combined with funds provided in welfare reform, will enable the program to serve an
        additional US million children by FY 2004; (2) provides $3 billion over five years to
        promote early learning; and (3) provides $173 million to improve child care quality.
        Additional funds for subsidies are necessary because currently, only 1.25 million of the
        approximately 10 million families eligible for assistance under federal law receive help.

        The President's proposal also includes $5 billion over five years to expand the Child and

                                                           4
                                                                        Hex-Dump COiiversion '
    Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDcrC) to provide greater tax relief for nearly three'million
    working families paying for child care and eliminate income tax liability for almost all families
    with incomes below 200 of poverty, Additionally, the proposal includes $1.3 billion to
    enable parents who have children under one year old to take advantage of the CDcrC by
    allowing these 1.7 million families to claim assumed child care expenses of $500. The
    President's plan also includes a new tax credit to businesses that offer child care services to
    their employees. The President has proposed spending $600 million in FY 2000 to triple
    funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Center Program, which supports the
    creation and expansion of after-school and summer-school programs to help roughly 1.1
    million children each year. Finally, the President's proposal includes a significant new
    investment in Head Start, our nation's premier early childhood development program, with
    an additional $607 million in FY 2000 to reach 42,000 more cbildren, enabling the program
    to serve 877,000 low income children.

   Providing Health Care to Low-Income Working Families. In passing welfare reform, the
    President insisted on maintaining the Medicaid entitlement; indeed, he vetoed two welfare
    bills that did not guarantee continued Medicaid coverage to all adults and children who were
    then eligible. Beyond preserving Medicaid eligibility, the Clinton Administration has
    accomplished the following to ensure that low-income families have access to health care.

    ~       Creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program. The President, with
            bipartisan support from the Congress, created the Children's Health Insurance
            Program (CHIP). The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allocated $24 billion dollars
            over the next five years to extend health care coverage to uninsured children through
            State-designed programs. States project that they will ensure 2.5 million children
            when their new CHIP programs are fully implemented.
            Allowing States to Expand Medicaid to Cover Families. The welfare law allows
          . states to expand Medicaid coverage under section 1931 to families who earn too
            much to be eligible for Medicaid but not enough to afford health insurance. These
            expansions allow states to present Medicaid as a freestanding health insurance
            program for low-income families -- an important step towards removing the stigma
            associated with the program and reaching families who do not have contact with the
            TANF system.
           Providing Medicaid Coverage to Low-income Two-Parent Families Who Work.
           In August 1998, the President eliminated a vestige of the old welfare system by
           allowing all states to provide Medicaid coverage to working, two-parent families who
           meet State income eligibility requirements. Under the old regulations, adults in
           two-parent families who worked more than 100 hours per month could not receive
           Medicaid regardless of their income level. Because the same restrictions did not
           apply to single-parent families, these regulations created disincentives to marriage and
           full-time work. Prior to eliminating the rule entirely, the Administration allowed a
           number of states to waive this rule. The new regulation eliminates this requirement
           for all States, providing health coverage for more than 130,000 working families to
           help them stay employed and off welfare.

           coverage to low-income households whose earnings or child support would otherwise
           make them ineligible for welfare-related Medicaid under state income eligibility
           standards. The President's FY 2000 Budget would reduce burdensome reporting
           requirements, including TMA eligibility procedures in the current Medicaid eligibility
           redetermination process. The budget also exempts those states that have expanded
           Medicaid coverage to families with incomes up to 185% of the federal poverty level
           from burdensome_TMA reporting requirements, providing states with additional
           incentives to provide critical health care services.
           Helping States Help Low-Income Families. In March 1999, the Administration
           released new guidance encouraging States to reach out to children and families who
           are no longer eligible for cash assistance but arestill eligible for Medicaid or CHIP.
           It also establishes that states must provide Medicaid applications upon request and
           process them without delay. The guidance reiterates state responsibilities to establish
           and maintain Medicaid eligibility for families and children affected by welfare
           reform, and provides creative examples of the best way to liberalize eligibility.

   Investing for the Future: In 1992, the President proposed to establish Individual
    Development Accounts (IDAs) to empower low-income families to save for a first home,
    post-secondary education, or to start a new business. The 1996 welfare reform law
    authorized the use of welfare block grants to create IDAs. And last year, the President
    signed legislation creating a five-year demonstration program. Households that are either
    eligible for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or qualify for the Earned Income Tax
    Credit and have a net worth below $10,000 are eligible to participate in the demonstration.
    The FY 1999 budget includes $10 million to launch this initiative, and the President has
    proposed to double the commitment to $20 million in FY 2000.


                         PROMOTING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

   Increasing Parental Responsibility and Enforcing Child Support: Tougher measures
    under the Clinton Administration resulted in a record $14.4 billion in child support
    collections in 1998, an increase of$6.4 billion, or 80% since 1992. Not only are collections
    up, but the number of families that are actually receiving child support has also increased. In
    1997, the number of child support cases with collections rose to 4.2 million, an increase of
    48% from 2.8 million in 1992.

    >-     Improving the Collection System. A new collection system, proposed by the
           President in 1994 and enacted as part of the 1996 welfare reform law, has located
           over 1.2 million delinquent parents in its first nine months of operation. With
           approximately one-third of all child support cases involving parents living in different
           states, this National Directory of New Hires helps track parents across state lines.
           Tougher Penalties. In June 1998, the President signed the Deadbeat Parents
           Punishment Act, a law based on his 1996 proposal for tougher penalties for parents
           who repeatedly fail to support children living in another state or who flee across state
           lines to avoid supporting them.
           Increasing Paternity Establishements. Paternity establishment, often the crucial

            first step in child support cases, has dramatically increased, due in large part to the
            in-hospital voluntary paternity establishment program begun in 1994 by the Clinton
            Administration. In 1997, the number of paternities established or acknowledged rose
            to a record 1.3 million, two and a half times the 1992 figure of 512,000.
            Increasing Collections. Finally, President Clinton has taken executive action,
            including: collections from federal payments such as income tax refunds and
            employee salaries, and steps to deny federal loans to delinquent parents. The federal
            government collected over $1.1 billion in delinquent child support from federal
            income tax refunds for tax year 1997, a 70% increase since 1992.

     Breaking the Cycle of Dependency -- Preventing Teen Pregnancy: Significant
      components of the President's comprehensive effort to reduce teen pregnancy became law
      when the President signed the 1996 Personal Responsibility Act. The law requires
      unmarried minor parents to stay in school and live at home or in a supervised setting;
      encourages "second chance homes" to provide teen parents with the skills and support they
      need; and, provides $50 million a year in new funding for state abstinence education
      activities. Since 1993, the Administration has supported innovative and promising teen
      pregnancy prevention strategies, including working with boys and young men on pregnancy
      prevention strategies. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, a private
      nonprofit organization, was formed in response to the President's 1995 State of the Union.
      In 1997, the President announced the National Strategy to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. The first
      annual report on this Strategy reported that HHS-supported programs already reach at least
      31 % or 1,470 communities in the United States. In April 1999, the Vice President
      announced new data showing that we continue to make real progress in encouraging more
      young people to delay parenthood -- teen births have declined nationwide by 16% from
      1991 to 1997, and have fallen in every state and across ethnic and racial groups. In addition,
    . teen pregnancy rates are at their lowest level in 20 years.

                  RESTORING FAIRNESS AND PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE

    The President made a commitment to fix several provisions in the welfare reform law that had
    nothing to do with moving people from welfare to work. In 1997, the President fought for and
    ultimately was successful in ensuring that the Balanced Budget Act protects the most vulnerable.
    In 1998, the President continued his proposals to reverse unfair cuts in benefits to legal immigrants.
    The Administration's FY 2000 budget would build on this progress by restoring important disability,
    health, and nutrition benefits to additional categories oflegal immigrants, at a cost of $1.3 billion
    over five years.

          Disability and Health: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Noncitizen Technical
           Amendment Act of 1998 invested $11.5 billion to restore disability and health benefits to
           380,000 legal immigrants who were in this country before welfare reform became law
           (August 22, 1996). The President's FY 2000 Budget would restore eligibility for SSI and
           Medicaid to legal immigrants who enter the country after that date if they have been in the
           United States for five years and become disabled after entering the United States. This
           proposal would cost approximately $930 million and assist an estimated 54,000 legal
           immigrants by 2004, about half of whom would be elderly.

          Nutritional Assistance: The Agricultural Research Act of 1998 provided Food Stamps for
           225,000 legal immigrant children, senior citizens, and people with disabilities who enter the
           United States by August 22, 1996. The President's FY 2000 Budget would extend this
           provision by allowing legal immigrants in the United States on August 22, 1996 who
           subsequently reach age 65 to be eligible for Food Stamps at cost of $60 million, restoring
           benefits to about 20,000 elderly legal immigrants by 2004.

          Health Care for Children and Pregnant Women: Under current law, states have the option
           to provide health coverage to immigrant children and pregnant women who entered the.
           country before August 22, 1996. The President's FY 2000 Budget gives states the option to
           extend Medicaid or CHIP coverage to low-income legal immigrant children and Medicaid to
           pregnant women who entered the country after August 22, 1996. The proposal would cost
           $325 million and provide critical health insurance to approximately 55,000 children and
           23,000 women by FY 2004. This proposal wO.uld reduce the number of high-risk
           pregnancies, ensure healthier children, and lower the cost of emergency Medicaid deliveries.

         Helping People Who Want to Work but Can't Find a Job: The Balanced Budget Act, as
          amended by the Agricultural Research Act, also restored $1.3 billion in food stamp cuts. The
          welfare reform law restricts food stamps to 3 out of every 36 months for able-bodied childless
          adults, unless they were working. Acknowledging that finding a job often takes time, the
          BBA provided funds for work slots and food stamp benefits to help those who are willing to
          work but, through no fault of their own, have not yet found employment. In addition, the
          BBA allows states to exempt up to 15 of the food stamp recipients (70,000 individuals
          monthly) who would otherwise be denied benefits as a result of the "3 in 36" limit.
