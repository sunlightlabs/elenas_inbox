           MORGAN STATE UNIVERSITY COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS

                            DATE:                 May 18,1997
                            LOCATION:             Morgan State University, Hughes Field
                            EVENT TIME:           10:00 am - 12:00 pm
                            FROM:                 Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      To deliver a commencement address and receive an honorary degree from Morgan State
      University, and to make new policy announcements on genetic testing and the
      development of an AIDS vaccine.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will be delivering the commencement address of Morgan State University's
      graduating class of approximately 850 students. There will be an audience of
      approximately 10,000 family members and friends of the graduates.

      Morgan State is one of two public universities in the state of Maryland and one of the
      nation's most respected historically black colleges. The other is the University of
      Maryland College Park. Morgan State traces its roots to the 1860s when it was founded
      as the Centenary Biblical Institute which educated men for the ministry. As it broadened
      its mission, it was renamed Morgan College in honor ofthe Reverend Lyttleton Morgan,
      the first Chairman of its Board of Trustees. In 1939 the State purchased the college in
      response to a study that found the State needed to provide more higher education
      opportunities for African-Americans. In 1975 the Legislature designated Morgan as a
      university, and the Legislature created an independent Board of Regents to govern the
      institution. In 1988 Maryland reorganized its higher education system by merging most
      campuses into the University of Maryland System. However, Morgan retained its
      independency and was designated by the Legislature as Maryland's Public Urban
      University -- which gave Morgan State the responsibility for offering programs at all
      degree levels, carrying out research, and developing programs that addressed the needs of
      the City of Baltimore.

      Morgan State currently enrolls 6,000 students, up from 3,500 a decade ago. 1,700 of its
      students reside on campus. At the undergraduate level, Morgan offers programs in the
      arts and sciences and in professional fields including business, teacher education,
       architecture, mathematics, the MBA, and doctorate programs in five fields of study.

       Some notable alumni of Morgan State include: Kweisi Mfume, President of the NAACP
       and former Chairman of the CBC, Richard Dixon, Maryland State Treasurer (first
       African-American to hold that post), Robert Bell, Chief Judge of Maryland's highest
       court (first African-American to hold the position); Earl Graves, Publisher of Black
       Enterprise Magazine; Maryland State Senator Clarence Blount, Senate Majority Leaders,
       (first African-American to hold the position); Major General Arthur Dean, US Army
       Director of Military Personnel Management, Office of Deputy Chief of Staff for
       Personnel; Major General Larry Ellis, Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel,
       Department of the Army, Brigadier General William E. Ward, 92nd Airborne
       Division.

        Morgan State has made the following commitments to the Administration's national
        priorities:
        - Committed Federal Work Study students to America Reads
        - Participates in the Direct Lending program
        - Participates in the Community Empowerment Initiative to revitalize Baltimore's poorest
          neighborhoods.
        - Performs extensive Community Outreach to public schools and young people in
 particular.
        - Leads several Science Education and Education Technology initiatives, including
 managing the Baltimore Urban Systemic Initiative, which reforms mathematics and
science education in the city's schools. It is also responsible for bringing city schools on-
          line, tutoring students in math and science, and sponsoring the City's Science Fair.

       You will make the following policy announcements in your remarks:

             Call on Congress to pass bipartisan legislation to prevent insurance
              discrimination based on genetic information. While genetic testing has the
              potential to identify hidden genetic disorders and spur early treatment -- such as
              Huntington's disease and certain types of breast cancer -- but genetic testing also
              can be used by insurance companies and others to discriminate and stigmatize
              groups of people. For example, in the early 1970's, health insurance coverage
              and jobs were denied to many African-Americans who were identified as carriers
              of sickle-cell anemia. Studies have shown that many Americans are extremely
              concerned with the possibility that their genetic makeup will be used to
              discriminate against them or a member of their family.

              Several bills have been introduced in this Congress, which prohibit health plans
              from requesting or using genetic information as a basis to deny health care
              coverage or raise premiums. The Administration supports the bipartisan
              legislation introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter, H.R. 306, because it represents a
              strong foundation for this much-needed reform. The Slaughter bill contains strict
    plans. The new legislation will build on the important anti-discrimination
    insurance laws in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
    (HIP AA). It would strengthen HIP AA by ensuring that in all cases genetic
    information will not be inappropriately used or disclosed by health plans. This
    would not only apply to health plans covered under ERISA but also provides
    blanket protections for all Americans who purchase individual policies.

    More than a dozen states have already enacted laws to restrict the use of genetic
    information in health insurance and at least thirty-one others have introduced
    legislation in 1997. However, state legislation is insufficient to solve this
    problem. The variability among state bills will lead to a lack of uniformity across
    the nation as to whether and how genetic information may be used by health
    plans.

   Challenge the nation to develop an AIDS vaccine within the next ten years.
    You will announce three important initiatives to help fulfill your commitment to
    developing an AIDS vaccine, including high-level international collaboration, a
    dedicated research center for AIDS vaccine research at the National Institutes of
    Health (NIH), and outreach to scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and patient
    advocates to maximize the involvement of both the private and public sectors in
    the development of an AIDS vaccine.

    The Administration has already taken steps to enhance the possibility of
    developing an AIDS vaccine by increasing funding for NIH vaccine research and
    development over 33 percent in the last two years -- from $111.1 million in FY
    1996 to $148 million proposed in the President's FY 1998 budget. Overall
    funding for AIDS research, prevention and care increased by more than 50 percent
    in the first four years of the Clinton Administration. Funding for AIDS Drug
    Assistance Programs (ADAP), which help low-income people purchase needed
    therapies, has tripled, while funding for the Ryan White CARE Act increased 158
    percent. The approval of new AIDS drugs has also greatly accelerated, with 16
    new AIDS drugs and two diagnostic tests.

    The new initiatives include:

           A New NIH AIDS Vaccine Center. A dedicated intramural HIV vaccine
           research and development center is being established at the National
           Institutes of Health. This vaccine center, which will be fully operational
           within the next several months, is uniting outstanding scientists in
           immunology, virology, and vaccinology to join in a highly-collaborative
           effort to develop an AIDS vaccine. Bringing together a broad array of
           researchers in an intensely-focused environment has been a successful way
           of developing vaccines in the past.

           A Global AIDS Vaccine Research Initiative. The United States is
           proposing that the leaders of the eight major industrialized nations meeting
                        research initiative. The proposal calls for each nation to make a
                        commitment to provide the necessary investments in their country to
                        accelerate research toward the development of an HIV /AIDS vaccine as a
                        scientific and public health priority. Joint meetings of key scientists from
                        participating nations will address research progress, identity scientific gaps
                        and opportunities, and design collaborative programs.

                        A Challenge to Pharmaceutical Manufacture Industry to Invest in
                        Innovative Research to Develop an AIDS Vaccine. We can only be
                        successful in developing an AIDS vaccine if private and public sectors
                        make this goal apriority. You will announce that you are challenging the
                        pharmaceutical industry to join the government in a partnership to realize
                        this important' goal.


       Background on HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS remains a global public health threat. More
       than 29 million men, women and children around the world have been infected with HIV
       -- more than 3 million infections occurring within the last year. Without an effective
       vaccine, AIDS will soon overtake tuberculosis and malaria as the leading cause of death
       among persons between 25-44 years of age. Between 650,000-900,000 Americans are
       estimated to be living with HIV disease, and over 300,000 Americans have already died
       from AIDS.

VI.     REMARKS

        Remarks Provided by Terry Edmonds in Speechwriting.
                         DEVELOP AN AIDS VACCINE

Today President Clinton challenged the nation to commit itself to the goal of developing an AIDS vaccine
within the next ten years. The President also announced a number of important initiatives to help fulfill this
commitment, including high-level international collaboration, a dedicated research center for AIDS vaccine
research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and outreach to scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and
patient advocates to maximize the involvement of both the private and public sectors in the development of
an AIDS vaccine. The President has already taken steps to enhance the possibility of developing an AIDS
vaccine by increasing funding for NIH vaccine research and development over 33 percent in the last two
years. The initiatives the President announced today, which build on an exceptional commitment to develop
better ways to prevent, diagnose, treat, and eventually cure AIDS, include:

      A New NIH AIDS Vaccine Center. A dedicated intramural HIV vaccine research and development
       center is being established at the National Institutes of Health. This vaccine center, which will be
       fully operational within the next several months, is uniting outstanding scientists in immunology,
       virology, and vaccinology to join in a highly-collaborative effort to develop an AIDS vaccine.
       Bringing together a broad array of researchers in an intensely-focused environment has been a
       successful way of developing vaccines in the past.

      A Global AIDS Vaccine Research Initiative. The United States is proposing that the leaders of the
       eight major industrialized nations meeting at the Denver Summit in June agree to support a
       worldwide AIDS vaccine research initiative. The proposal calls for each nation to make a
       commitment to provide the necessary investments in their country to accelerate research toward the
       development of an HIV/ AIDS vaccine as a scientific and public health priority. Joint meetings of
       key scientists from participating nations will address research progress, identity scientific gaps and
       opportunities, and design collaborative programs.

      A Challenge to Pharmaceutical Manufacture Industry to Invest in Innovative Research to
       Develop an AIDS Vaccine. We can only be successful in developing an AIDS vaccine if private
       and public sectors make this goal a priority. The President is challenging the pharmaceutical
       industry to join the government in a partnership to realize this important goal.

Background on HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS remains a global public health threat. More than 29 million men,
women and children around the world have been infected with HIV -- more than 3 million infections
occurring within the last year. Without an effective vaccine, AIDS will soon overtake tuberculosis and
malaria as the leading cause of death among persons between 25-44 years of age. Between 650,000-900,000
Americans are estimated to be living with HIV disease, and over 300,000 Americans have already died from
AIDS.

Clinton Administration Accomplishments on HIV/AIDS. The Clinton Administration has made a
sustained commitment to addressing the HIV epidemic through investments in prevention, research and
treatment.

      Increased funding for the NIH vaccine by 33 percent. Funding for NIH vaccine research and
       development has increased over 33 percent in the last two years -- from $111.1 million in FY 1996 to
       $148 million proposed in the President's FY 1998 budget.

      Funding for AIDS research, prevention and care increased by more than 50 percent in the first
       four years of the Clinton Administration. Funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP),
       which help low-income people purchase needed therapies, has tripled, while funding for the Ryan
       White CARE Act increased 158 percent. The approval of new AIDS drugs has greatly accelerated,
       with 16 new AIDS drugs and two diagnostic tests.
                             ON GENETIC INFORMATION

In his commencement address at Morgan State University today, the President highlighted the great
potential and possible perils of recent advances in genetic research. To address widespread concerns
about potential abuses, the President Clinton called upon Congress to pass bipartisan legislation that
would prohibit insurance companies from using genetic information to determine premium rates or
eligibility for health plans.

ADVANCES IN SCIENCE:            POTENTIALS AND PERILS

Genetic testing has the potential to identify hidden genetic disorders and spur early treatment. Tests
for genetic predisposition to certain diseases and conditions -- such as Huntington's disease and certain
types of breast cancer -- are already available and more genetic tests are on the horizon. But genetic
testing also can be used by insurance companies and others to discriminate and stigmatize groups of
people. We know that genetic information has been used to discriminate against people in the past.
In the early 1970's, health insurance coverage and jobs were denied to many African-Americans who
were identified as carriers of sickle-cell anemia. Studies have shown that many Americans are
extremely concerned with the possibility that their genetic makeup will be used to discriminate against
them or a member of their family.

ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NEEDED

The new legislation will build on the important anti-discrimination insurance laws in the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). It would strengthen HIP AA by
ensuring that in all cases genetic information will not be inappropriately used or disclosed by health
plans. This would not only apply to health plans covered under ERISA but also provides blanket
protections for all Americans who purchase individual policies.

More than a dozen states have already enacted laws to restrict the use of genetic information in health
insurance and at least thirty-one others have introduced legislation in 1997. However, state
legislation is insufficient to solve this problem. The variability among state bills will lead to a lack of
uniformity across the nation as to whether and how genetic information may be used by health plans.

BUILDING ON THE EXISTING BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION

Several bills have been introduced in this Congress, which prohibit health plans from requesting or
using genetic information as a basis to deny health care coverage or raise premiums. The President
believes that the bipartisan legislation introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter, H.R. 306, represents a
strong foundation for this much-needed reform. The Slaughter bill contains strict protections against
disclosure of an individual's genetic information by health plans. The President looks forward to
working with Rep. Slaughter and other members in both parties to pass legislation on this important
issue in this Congress.
