MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report


         Tobacco -- Surgeon General's Report on Minority Smoking: On Monday, Dr.
Satcher will present you with a new Surgeon General's report on tobacco use and the impact of
smoking on four minority groups (African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and
American Indians/Alaska Natives). We are planning a South Lawn event (near the sculpture
garden) with you, the Vice President, Secretary Shalala, and the Surgeon General. The report is
the first comprehensive compilation of all of research on tobacco and minorities, and it is
Satcher's first report as Surgeon General.

        The report finds that between 1991 and 1997, the prevalence of smoking increased by 80
percent for African-American youths and by 34 percent for Hispanic youths after years of
significant decline. Additionally, Native Americans have the highest rate of smoking among
any US subgroup. The report finds that cigarette smoking is a major cause of disease and death
among minority populations, and says that iftobacco use is not reduced, they will experience
increased mortality and morbidity from tobacco. The report also suggests that the tobacco
industry's targeted advertising and promotion of tobacco products within minority communities
may undennine prevention and cessation efforts and lead to serious health consequences for
these populations. Finally, the report calls for more research into effective and culturally
appropriate prevention and cessation programs.

       We will use this event to demonstrate why Congress needs to pass comprehensive
tobacco legislation this year, and to get the minority health groups and Members of Congress
invested in the legislation. At the same time, we will carefully craft our message so that it does
not appear that we are making new demands for legislation.

       Tobacco -- Legislative Update: As you know, we are engaging in discussions in hopes
of producing an agreed-upon bill to go to the Senate floor. We had cordial meetings with
Senators Daschle and McCain early in the week. On Thursday, we met with Senator Mack, who
gave us some insight into the GOP leadership's thinking. He indicated that they need some
cover on liability and _ _ . Also on Thursday, the Vice President, Erskine, Larry and I met
with Senators Kennedy and Comad to discuss changes to the McCain bill.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

[Note to Elena -- I've tried, but I don't know enough to really write this, unfortunately]

         Health Care -- Republicans Likely to Join on the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights
Legislation: Congressman Ganske met with Congressman Dingell this week to inform him that
at least five Republicans, and hopefully more, are willing to sign onto the Dingell/Gephardt
patients' bill of rights legislation. We view this as extremely positive news, as it will no doubt
create additional pressure on the Republicans to produce patients' rights legislation. We are
hearing that the Republican House task force is drafting legislation in this area, but that it will
likely include "poison pill" provisions that are designed to slow this legislation down, including
medical malpractice and expansions of multi-employer welfare associations (MEW As) that could
undermine the insurance market. However, we believe that if Republicans sign onto the
Democratic bill it would provide additional leverage to eliminate some ofthe objectionable
provisions the task force will likely propose. We are reaching out to Dr. Ganske and Mr.
Dingell to determine if we could set up a high profile meeting with the Republican co-sponsors
in the White House next week. Such an event would receive great attention and would enhance
the likelihood of Congressional passage this year.

        Health Care -- Update on Assisted Suicide Issue: A recent study for the New England
Journal of Medicine on assisted suicide found that five percent or less of physicians have ever
administered injections or prescribed medications to hasten the death ofterminally ill patients.
However, the study also found that 36 percent of physicians would write lethal prescriptions if
they were legal. This broadly reported study might increase Republicans' interest in seeking
Federal legislation to overturn Oregon's assisted suicide law. Their interest in this issue will
further intensify when the Justice Department offers its legal interpretation concluding that the
Drug Enforcement Agency has no statutory authority to regulate the practice of doctors
prescribing medication that hasten death. We believe that we will have to release this
interpretation ,within the next two weeks. We will be sending you a memo next week that
outlines options that position us best to respond to the likely Republican initiative.

        Food Safety -- Administration Announced New Rules To Improve Safety of Juice:
On Sunday, we leaked the announcement of two proposed regulations by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to improve the safety of fruit and vegetable juices. The first regulation
would require that all fruit and vegetable juice processors implement a Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Point (HACCP) system which will ensure that processors take extra steps to
reduce the numbers of microorganisms that may be in their products. Retailers of packaged
juice, as well as processors who sell less than 40,000 gallons of fresh juice per year, would be
exempt from this requirement. The second proposed rule would require any packaged untreated
juice to be labeled with a warning statement advising consumers of the potential risks of juice
that has not been processed to eliminate dangerous bacteria. This requirement will apply to
retail and other processors who package untreated juice for consumption off-site -- such as
grocery stores that squeeze and bottle juice for home use. But retail sellers of juice for
consumption on-site -- such as restaurants and children's lemonade stands -- will be exempt from
this labeling requirement. Although 98 percent of juice sold in the United States is pasteurized,


                                                 2

the FDA estimates that there are up to 48,000 juice-related illnesses per year_ In 1996, one
sixteen-month-old girl died, and at least 66 others were sickened in the western United States and
Canada from drinking untreated Odwalla brand apple juice. The Administration received three
days of positive press on this announcement, including coverage on ABC News, CNN, every
major newspaper, and a lead story on CBS News on Tuesday.

         AIDS -- Needle Exchange: Following the needle exchange decision, AIDS advocates
and the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS expressed sharp criticism. The Office of
National AIDS Policy and other members ofthe Administration continue to talk and meet with
them. Weare coordinating a response plan, including phone calls to key individuals and
mitigating initiatives. We are assessing the possibility of augmenting HIV prevention and drug
treatment funding, along with a radio address and/or statement marking the one year anniversary
of your announcing the HIV vaccine initiative (May 18). Legislation imposing a permanent
restriction on federal funding has been introduced in both the House and the Senate. We will
work with Legislative Affairs and OMB to respond.

        Welfare Reform -- Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy: On April 30th, Secretary
Shalala will host a reception in the Indian Treaty Room for the 1998 Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy honorees. Honorees include: Governor Carper; NBC; the Teen Outreach Program;
Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD); The Children's Network, a conflict-resolution
program in San Bernadino; Dayton-Hudson (Target Stores); and Jerry Tello and Geoffrey Canada
for their work on male involvement. The Secretary will announce the honorees, read a
Presidential Message for Teen Pregnancy Prevention Month, and release a "chart book" of teen
birth data. This previously-released data, presented in a comprehensive new user-friendly
format, shows that the number ofteen births has declined from 1991 to 1996, but remains
unacceptably high. This is one of a series of events to mark the Campaign's anniversary and to
kick off Teen Pregnancy Prevention Month in May. The theme for this year is "adults matter".
Following the reception, the Campaign will hold a press briefing on the Hill with their
Congressional Task Force to release new research, focus group results, and tips for parents all
highlighting the critical role that parents and adults play in reducing teen pregnancy.

        Welfare -- L.A. County Child Support Enforcement System Penalty: Both the
House and Senate are moving forward on bills to ensure that states face tough but reasonable
penalties if they fail to establish child support enforcement computer systems on time. We will
probably favor the tougher House bill. California faces penalties because it has traditionally
relied on county-based systems and its state-wide system has failed to function. The Senate bill
was specifically crafted to satisfy members from California, but L.A. County remains very
unhappy with it and is pushing both Congress and the Administration to give L.A. County a
special exemption from any penalty.

        Officials from the D.A. 's office argue that L.A. County has an excellent county system
that has long functioned well and was designed with federal involvement under a waiver several
years ago. OPC, HHS, and OMB believe that offering any such exemption would set a bad

precedent for numerous other counties, and that the federal government must hold states
accountable for their actions (states are not required to pass along penalties to counties). So far
Hill leaders have not supported L.A. County's exemption, and California members like Matsui
and Stark oppose such an exemption. Elena -- Please note: This item is very probably not
ready for him to review, because we haven't gotten our White House position together yet,
but we thought we should let you see it and make the call.

         Crime -- Chicago Gang Ordinance: On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear
the City of Chicago's defense of an anti-loitering statute that it passed in 1992, and which the
Illinois Supreme Court had ruled was impermissibly vague and violating due process (Chicago v.
Morales). The ordinance authorizes police officers to order individuals loitering in public places
to disperse if the officer "reasonably believes" any ofthe individuals belongs to a street gang.
Individuals who refuse to abide by the officers order could be arrested and, if convicted,
sentenced up to 6 months in prisons, a $500 fine or 120 hours of community service. The
Chicago ordinance was challenged by the Illinois chapter of the ACLU .. Amicus briefs were
filed by : (1) a coalition of community organizations in Chicago; (2) the major national
associations representing local government officials including, the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
National League of Cities, National Association of Counties, and International Association of
Chiefs of Police; and (3) 13 of the states.

        The Chicago ordinance is similar to other efforts that cities and law enforcement have
used to crack down on gangs (e.g., Los Angeles' use of individual restraining orders to disrupt
gang presence on city streets), and in which we have taken an interest. We are schedule to meet
with Rahm and Chuck Ruff next week to discuss this issue further.

        Crime -- Survey of Jail Inmates: On Sunday, the Justice Department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics will release a study on jail inmates. By mid-year 1997, the nation's jails held
567,079 inmates -- up 40 percent from the 405,320 at mid-year 1990. The survey of men and
women in local jails between October 1995 and March 1996 found:

   Inmate Demographics: 90 percent of the inmates were male and 10 percent were female.
    Whites made up 37 percent of all inmates; 41 percent were black; 19 percent were Hispanics
    and 4 percent were Asian, Pacific Islanders, American Indians or Alaska natives.
   Drug use up: More than half of all convicted jail inmates used drugs in the month before
    their offense, compared to 44 percent in 1989, the last year the survey was conducted. In
    addition, there were increases across the board with respect to reported drug use: 82 percent
    reported having used drugs at least once in their lives (78 percent in 1989); 78 percent
    reported having used marijuana (71 percent in 1989); 34 percent reported stimulant use (22
    percent in 1989); 32 percent used hallucinogens (24 percent in 1989); and 24 percent used
    heroin (from 19 percent in 1989). In both 1996 and 1989, half of the inmates reported using
    cocame.




                                                 4

   Violent crime charges slightly up. The percentage of inmates charged with violent crimes
    increased from 23 percent in 1989 to 26 percent in 1996, with drug offenses largely
    unchanged 22 percent.
   Majority already under criminal justice supervision: Approximately 54 percent of jail
    inmates were already under the jurisdiction of the criminal justice system at the time of their
    arrest -- usually probation.
   Many on welfare or unemployed. Nearly 39 percent of all inmates were raised in families
    that had received welfare of public housing assistance. At the time of their arrest, 20 percent
    were receiving some form of government assistance, such as welfare, SSI, or unemployment
    compensation. Over one-third (36 percent) were unemployed.
   History of sexual or physical abuse common. Almost 48 percent of female and 13 percent
    of maie inmates reported having been sexually or physically abused at least once in their
    lives. About 27 percent of women and 3 percent of men reported having been raped.

        Drugs -- Republican Task Force on Drugs: On Thursday, April 30th, Speaker
Gingrich, Representatives Hastert and Portman, and other House Republicans will unveil a
national drug strategy and call for the passage of about 12 different pieces of anti-drug legislation
throughout the remainder of the Congressional calendar. We do not have any specific details on
these bills, but the tentative list includes: (1) the Drug-Free Parents and Youth Empowerment
Act; (2) Marijuana Abuse Initiatives (medical marijuana opposition); (3) Drug-Free Workplace
Act; (4) Drug-Free America Commission Act; (5) Drug-Free Prisons and Jails Act; (6) Drug-Free
Schools Performance Act; (7) Drug-Free Professional and Olympic Athlete Responsibility
Resolution; (8) Drug-Free Teenage Drives Act; (9) Drug-Free Congressional Leadership
Resolution; (10) Drug Czar Reauthorization Act; (11) Drug-Free Borders and Hemisphere Act;
and (12) Drug-Free Communities and National Clearinghouse Act.

        Drunk Driving -- .08 BAC: Conferees for the omnibus highway bill convened their
first meeting on Thursday. House Transportation Committee Chairman Shuster indicated that
he would be willing to make concessions on a variety of provisions, including Senator
Lautenberg's amendment to create a national impaired driving standard of .08 BAC, in return for
a commitment to use future gas tax revenues exclusively for highway construction. While this
particular counteroffer would be unacceptable, WH Leg Affairs is hopeful that the Lautenberg
drunk driving provision may be resolved favorably during negotiations. Conferees are
attempting to complete work on the bill prior to the Memorial Day recess.

        Immigration -- HIB visas: HIB visas are temporary work visas that allow "highly
skilled" immigrants (with a BA or equivalent) to work in this country for up to six years. Under
current law, the number ofHIB visas is capped at 65,000 per year. Last year, this cap was
reached for the first time. The information technology industry strongly supports raising the
annual cap to address what they maintain is a shortage of U.S. workers with IT skills. Others,
including the Department of Labor, challenge the industry's conclusions about a shortage and are
concemed that the current HIB program does nothing to target its use to employers who are
experiencing skills shortages.


                                                 5
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

        Though the Administration has never before squarely addressed the issue of the cap, we
have consistently emphasized training and re-training U.S. workers to enable them to move into
jobs within the high-tech industry. Also, since 1993 we have sought reforms to the HIB
program that would target their use to industries with genuine short-term skill shortages. In
response to the prospect of reaching the annual cap sometime in Mayor June, the DPC and NEC
engaged an inter-agency process (including Labor, Commerce, Treasury, State, Justice and INS)
to determine the best course to address both the concerns of the high-tech industry and U.S. labor
interests.

        On April 2, 1998, the Administration (Secretaries Daley and Herman and Attorney
General Reno) sent a letter to Congress that advocated increased training for U.S. workers and
reform of the HIB program to target its use to employers who are experiencing skill shortages.
We are working with members of the House and Senate to develop legislative language that is
consistent with the Administration's objectives.

       Education -- D.C. Vouchers: Mr. Armey announced earlier this week his plan to
bring a D.C. voucher bill to the House floor next week. DPC, Legislative Affairs and the
Education Department are working with Ms. Norton and Mr. Gephardt's staff to fashion a
message and legislative strategy that builds on the ideas in your Education Opportunity
Zones proposal ~, ending social promotions and fixing failing schools) and your budget
proposals for D.C. already worked out with the D.C. schools ~, funding for summer
school to support the District's new effort to end social promotions, for efforts to
implement proven practices in low performing schools, and to provide reading specialists
and teacher training in reading. Elena-we have a meeting at 4:30 Friday with
NortoniGephardt stafJto finalize our plan; that's why this is a bit short on detail now.

        Education -- Ending Social Promotions: NYC Chancellor Rudy Crew unveiled a
proposal this week to end social promotions, by requiring students to pass tests in the 4th
and 7th grade in order to be promoted. The proposal has received favorable reactions
from a number of quarters, including the press--which has routinely noted your call to end
social promotions. The proposal has also focused public attention on the need to
strengthen teaching in all grades, to provide extra help early on to students who need it,
and to provide students in danger of failing with summer school.

        Education -- D.C. Charter Schools: 19 applicants for charter schools have received
preliminary approval to begin operations in the District of Columbia, bringing the total of charter
schools in DC to 23. Nine of these schools were approved by the DC Board of Education -- the
elected board that was stripped of all powers except to charter schools. Ten schools were .
approved by the Independent Public Charter School Board -- a board appointed by Mayor Barry
from a pool of names given by Secretary Riley. Among the new schools: a residential charter
school for at-risk middle school students, an adult education center for immigrants, and a
"hospitality" high school organized by the area hotel industry.

         Education -- California charter schools: Negotiations are underway between Silicon
Valley high-tech executives and the California Teachers' Association (CTA) over a possible
legislative alternative to a charter school ballot initiative backed by the executives and opposed
by the CTA. The Silicon Valley executives have been prepared to submit and campaign for a
ballot initiative making it easier to start charter schools in California, and the CTA -- while
expressing support for the concept of charter schools -- has indicated they would strongly oppose
the initiative. The CTA has been concerned about specific provisions in the initiative that would
eliminate the cap on how many charter schools can be created, as well as the impact of the ballot
on teacher certification and due.process in charter schools.

        The negotiations are aimed at reaching a legislative compromise as a substitute for the
ballot initiative. A bill needs to pass the California legislature by May 1 in order for the
high-tech executives to drop the ballot initiative, and it appears possible (though not probable)
that an agreement will be reached in time. We will provide you a status report before your trip
to California next week.

        Education -- National Board for Professional Teaching Standards: Earlier this week
a bipartisan group of eight governors (Hunt, Locke, Chiles, Carper, Voinovich, Racicot, Branstad
and Thompson) wrote to Bill Goodling and to the other chairs and ranking members of the
appropriate authorizing and appropriations committee chairs, expressing their support for the
National Board and for your funding request for the Board's work.

       Service -- One-Year Anniversary of Philadelphia Service Summit: On Monday,
April 27, General Colin Powell will present a report on what his group America's Promise has
accomplished in the year since the service summit. He is expected to focus on corporations that
have made new commitments or followed through on prior ones, and on communities that have
continued the summit's work. His report will also include an update on federal agency
commitments. He will present his rePort in Chicago to a special meeting of the U.S. Conference
of Mayors.

        Disability Issues -- First Disability Task Force Meeting: The task force you created
last month by executive order on employment of people with disabilities got off to a strong start
this week at its first meeting. Secretary Herman chaired an all-day meeting before an audience
of200 disability activists, including panels on health care, education and training, and civil
rights. The task force hopes to issue a few recommendations in July, with a fuller report in
November. While the health care panel was quite successful, we face particular challenges
crafting policies in that area. Specifically, Congress is considering legislation to move forward
on the disability community's two highest priorities, but we are still sorting out whether the
Administration will be able to support these initiatives, in full or in part.

       First, legislation is moving in both houses to encourage people with disabilities on the
ssm or SSI rolls to return to work. Sens. Jeffords and Kennedy have introduced a bill in the
Senate, while Reps. Bunning and Kennelly's bill is being marked up in the House. These

proposals would allow people to retain Medicare or Medicaid after they return to work, raising
concerns about costs we have not planned for in our budget. While we look at alternatives, we
are also stressing the value of a little-known provision we won in the Balanced Budget Act that
lets states offer a Medicaid buy-in for this population.

        Second, the House held a hearing last month on how to allow more people with
disabilities to live in their communities instead of nursing homes. Disability advocates, led by
the group ADAPT, are pushing legislation known as CASA. They do not expect CASA to
become law because of its cost ($10-20 billion per year), but hope it will start a dialogue on the
subject. Last September, you met with disability advocates, including ADAPT, and stated that
the Administration would move forward on this issue. At the hearing, HHS witnesses testified
that we have concerns about CASA's cost, but said we are pushing to achieve the goals of the
legislation through more modest steps, such an HHS workgroup that is developing
demonstrations and research. Speaker Gingrich testified in favor of this concept, although
without endorsing CASA itself. The disability community is disappointed that we have not been
more supportive. Elena -- I heard from Chris Jennings that you wanted an update on the
disability task force meeting, and that I should include the update I previously wrote on
this topic, since it was not included in past weeklies. Hope this makes sense.
