                         Low UNEMPLOYMENT, STRONG}OB GROWTH, AND Low INFLATION
                                             September 5, 1997
     TODAr'S DATA SHOW CONTINUED JOB GROWTH WITH HISTORICALLY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

      Unemployment is at 4.9 percent, as low as its been in 24 years.
              The August unemployment rate was 4.9 -- its 36th consecutive month below 6 and as low as it's been
               since 1973. The unemployment rate has been at or below 5 for five months now with no signs of
               inflationary pressures. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5 . [Source: BLS.]
              The combined rate of unemployment and inflation has been lower under President Clinton than any other
               Administration since Lyndon Johnson was President. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]

      Nearly 13 Million New Jobs.
               During the Clinton Administration, the economy has added nearly 13 million new jobs -- a faster annual
                rate of job growth (2.5 percent per year) than any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s.
                [Source: Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]
               The economy has added 2.5 million jobs over the past year.

        Strong Private-Sector Job Growth.
             Over the past year, the private sector has added 2.2 million jobs -- much more than during the entire
              four-year period before President Clinton took office. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]
             92 percent of the nearly 13 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector -- that's
              a higher percentage than any Administration since Truman. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]

        Turning The Corner In Basic American Industries.
             Mter losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous four years, l.l million new construction jobs
              have been added since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S
              Truman was President. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]
             Mter losing 35,000 jobs in the auto industry during the Bush years, we have 136,000 new auto jobs since
              President Clinton took office. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]

     LAST WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT THE ECONOMY GREW AT A 3.6 PERCENT ANNUAL RATE LAST
     QUARTER, WHILE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN LOW. BUSINESS INVESTMENT HAS GROWN
     BY 11 PERCENT PER YEAR SINCE PRESIDENT CLINTON TOOK OFFICE -- THE FASTEST FOR ANY
     ADMINISTRATION SINCE JOHN F. KENNEDY WAS PRESIDENT. THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO
     EXPERIENCE ROBUST GROWTH, STRONG INVESTMENT, AND LOW INFLATION.

     EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG:
        Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 7/22/97: "The recent performance of the economy,
         characterized by strong growth and low inflation, has been exceptional--and better than most anticipated."
        David Berson, chief economist, Fannie Mae, 6/14/97: "What we have now is the best combination of
         sustained growth and low inflation that we have had in at least a decade."
        Fortune, 6/9/97: "Business is booming, inflation is falling, jobs are plentiful, and American industry is way out
         in front. The U.S. economy is stronger than it's ever been before."
        Business Week, 5/19/97: "Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion
         over five years, sparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and
         systems that brought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity."
