 * In discussing this initiative, we have concluded that it is prudent not to make analogies
juxtaposing the future of u.s. race relations with instances of civil war or major ethnic strife,
e.g. Bosnia, Zaire or the Mid East. However, it is all right to talk affirmatively about the U.S.
as a beacon and example to a world where there are deep divisions among ethnic, racial and
religious groups within nations and among nations.

           The charge the President set is for us to shape an initiative that will make a
           difference for Americans

                 He wants to make changes and improvements that we can look back
                  on with pride.

                 His goal is for us to enter the next century as a strong and united
                  America.
           At a time when affirmative action and other tools to deal with discrimination
           are under attack, we must establish a new American consensus about what it
           means to be and become One America.

                 While there is no immediate crisis driving us, the President believes
                  that we should take stock of the progress we have made in race
                  relations and take action to improve the ability of all Americans to
                  succeed in the 21st century.

           We face a very different America in the next century.

                 After all, America has changed a great deal in the past three decades.
                  Hispanic-Americans are now the fastest growing minority group.

                 There are four school districts in the country, including one right
                  across the river from here --in Virginia --that have children from
                  more than 100 different racial and ethnic groups in one single school
                  district. We should embrace such diversity.

           The President has long maintained that the evil of racism is rooted in our
           separateness.

                 He believes that greater dialogue between individuals of different
                  races will reveal the similar interests and values all Americans share.

                 The President wants to encourage Americans to celebrate their
                  diversity while reinforcing the values important to us all.


                                                              Automated Records Management System

                    The President has been a constant voice in pressing racial healing and
                    unity. Those occasions include:

                          speeches in Memphis, Tennessee in 1993 and Austin, Texas in 1995,
                          his inaugural and State of the Union addresses this year,
                          a recent radio address,
                          the Jackie Robinson anniversary commemoration.
                          the apology for the Tuskegee experiment
                          his commencement speech at Morgan State University -- an
                           historically Black college.

                    The President's experiences with discrimination are rooted in the South and
                    in the legacy slavery left.

                          His grandfather had a grade school education and ran a grocery store
                           in Hope, Arkansas. Most of his customers were black, poor and were
                           working people. As a child in that store, President Clinton learned
                           that people of different races could and should treat each other with
                           respect and dignity.

                          While his grandparents were in the minority being poor, Southern
                           whites who were pro-civil rights, they taught the President a lesson
                           that he has carried with him through life -- Discrimination is not just
                           morally wrong, it hurts everyone.

                   The President has been consistent and steadfast throughout his life and
                    professional career in his pursuit of equality and opportunity for all.

                    We are crafting an initiative that capitalizes on the power of the Presidency
                    and the strengths of this President.

                          The bully pulpit is a potent amplifier of any Presidential message.

                          President Clinton's personal history and conviction to lead this
                           country in finding strength in our diversity make him well suited to
                           help forge alliances and reconcile differences among us.

                   The President has not yet settled on the set of activities that will constitute
                    this initiative. We are designing a proposal that strikes the right balance
                    between study and action.
