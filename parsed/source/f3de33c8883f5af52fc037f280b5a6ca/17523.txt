     Budget Office projected that the 1997 budget deficit would be $319 billion; it was $23 billion -- that's $296
     billion lower than projected.


SPENDING AS A SHARE OF THE ECONOMY IS LOWEST SINCE EARLY 1970s
     Spending As Share of Economy Is Lowest Since 1974. As a share ofGDP, spending was 20.1 percent in

BALANCED BUDGET ACT WILL NOW FINISH THE JOB AND BALANCE THE BUDGET
    Balanced Budget Act Signed By President Clinton Will Eliminate Deficit. Both the Office of
     Management and Budget and Congressional Budget Office conclude that the Balanced Budget Act will
     complete the job of balancing the budget by 2002 -- the first balanced budget since 1969. The balanced
     budget agreement includes roughly $900 billion over 10 years in net deficit reduction.

In 1992, the deficit was $290 billion,job growth was weak, and the unemployment rate was 7.5 percent. When               ~

our people, and opening foreign markets to American goods. Experts agree that this strategy has helped cut the           {!'r;
deficit to its lowest level since 1974, create 13.2 million new jobs, and lower the unemployment rate to under five
percentfor the first time in over two decades.

    level since 1974. Experts -- such as Alan Greenspan, Business Week, and Fortune -- agree that the deficit
    reduction from the President's 1993 Economic Plan led to a drop in long-term interest rates and a stronger
    economy. Under President Clinton, the 3D-year interest rate has averaged 6.9 percent -- down from 8.2 percent
    under President Bush and 10.3 percent under President Reagan. [Source: Department of the Treasury, Office of Economic Policy]

    o    Business Week, 5/19/97: "Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion
         over five years, sparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and systems
         that brought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity."

     o   Paul Volcker, Federal Reserve Chairman (1979-1987), Audacity, Fall 1994: "The deficit has come down, and I
         give the Clinton Administration and President Clinton himself a lot of credit for that....and I think we're seeing
         some benefits."

    o    Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Chairman, 1/31/94: "The actions taken last year to reduce the federal budget
         deficit have been instrumental in creating the basis for declining inflation expectations and easing pressures on
         long-term interest rates."

     o   Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Chairman, 2/20/96: The deficit reduction in the President's 1993 Economic Plan
         was "an unquestioned factor in contributing to the improvement in economic activity that occurred thereafter."

    o    Congressional Budget Office, Economic and Budget Oudook, Jan. 1994: "The dramatic improvement [in the deficit]
         since last January is largely the result of the enactment in August of... the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
         1993."

     o   Fortune, 10/3/94: "[President Clinton's 1993] economic plan helped bring interest rates down, spurring the recovery."
     o   Lehman Brothers, 1/10/94: "Lower deficits, lower long-term rates and higher real growth was the overall promise.
          With the data now rolling in for December 1993, it seems clear that President Clinton delivered on all three
         counts ... "

    With Lower Interest Rates, The Economy Has Boomed. As interest rates came down, business investment
    accelerated, leading to higher job growth, lower unemployment, and a stock market boom.

    o    Fastest Business Investment Growth Since Kennedy. Since President Clinton took office, real business investment
         has grown 1l.4 percent per year -- fastest rate of growth since John Kennedy was President.

    o    13.2 Million New Jobs and Lowest Unemployment Rate in 24 Years. Since President Clinton took office, the
         economy has created 13.2 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has dropped from 7.5 percent in 1992 to
         4.9 percent today -- for the first time in 24 years, the unemployment rate dropped below 5 percent.

    o    Stock Market Has More Than Doubled. With low interest rates, the stock market has boomed: up more than 125
         percent since January 1993, when the Dow Jones was just 3,242.

    Even As Economy Has Strengthened, Interest Rates Have Remained Low. From 1988 to 1992, the
    3D-year interest rate averaged 8.2 percent, while GDP growth averaged 1.3 percent per year and business
    investment growth averaged 1.9 percent per year. Simple economic logic suggests that as the economy
    strengthens and the demand for capital increases, interest rates should rise. However, even as economic growth
      3D-year interest rate has fallen to about 6.4 percent today.
