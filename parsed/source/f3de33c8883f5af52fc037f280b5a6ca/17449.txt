TEXT:
Rahm, et. al.:

I've attached a DRAFT of some positive talking points for any Q's we may
get tomorrow on the NBC or the LA Times stories on assaults.   I understand
from the LA Times reporter that Senator Feinstein is qu.oted as saying that
our action is "worthless" ... or something like that. I tried very hard to
put our action into a broader context -- our long-term record on imports,
China, curios and relics, etc. -- but don't know if I succeeded.

These talking points try and address Senator Feinstein's minimizing of our
directive in the LA Times piece -- but they're stretching a bit. Also, I
will visit w/Counsel and Treasury one more time about trying to cover the
existing Uzi and other permits.  I did speak to ATF Counsel tonight, and
they insist we can't act on the current permits.    While the Bush
Administration did this in 1989, was sued ... and won, all of our lawyers
say that this was an entirely different situaion. More than a million
assault rifles had been approved for import, and many were being recovered
at crime scenes.  With respect to the Uzis, not a one has even come in.
In any event, we better do this soon.  The increased media coverage is
sure to result in new applications for imports.

Rahm, Elena, Bruce -- let me know if you think these talking points work.

Jose'

        DIRECTIVE ON THE IMPORTATION OF ASSAULT-TYPE WEAPONS
                                     (10/22/97)


   Two-part directive to be signed. This week the President will sign a
    directive ordering the Treasury Department to: (1) temporarily suspend any
    pending and future applications to import modified assault weapons, and
    (2) reexamine -- and, if necessary, modify -- the criteria used to keep
    non-sporting weapons out of the country.

   Taking action before assault-type weapons flood our streets. Over the
    past few years, firearms manufacturers have adapted -- or "sporterized"
    -- certain assault weapons to circumvent the ban on their importation.
    There are about 30 models of these firearms -- including the new Uzi
    American and Galil Sporter, which have already been mentioned in the
    press. To date, only limited numbers of these weapons -- about 10,000 in
    1995 and 25,000 in 1996 (and no Uzis) -- have actually been imported. By
    acting now, the Administration can avert the type of crisis faced by the
    Bush Administration in 1989. At that time, permits for more than a million
    assault rifles had been approved, and an increasing number of assault
    rifles were being recovered at crime scenes.

   Directive to be broader than Senator Feinstein's request. While Senator
    Feinstein has essentially asked the Administration to revoke the existing
    permit to import several thousand Uzis and Galils, the long-term impact of
    the President's directive could be much broader. By conducting a
    thorough review and amending the sporting purposes test as appropriate
    -- the directive covers many more weapons and is likely to have a
    broader long-term impact. Instead of just focusing on a single permit. the
    President's directive is intended to permanently ban the next generation
    of assault-type weapons.

   Unprecedented record on firearms imports. This Administration has done
    more than any other in using every tool and legal authority available to
    keep non-sporting, military surplus and other firearms out of the country.
    Under the President's leadership, literally, millions of firearms -- of all sorts --
    have been blocked from importation. For instance:

          - In 1993, the President issued a directive to close the loophole that
          allowed certain assault pistols to be imported (despite the Bush
          Administration's 1989 ban on the importation of assault rifles).

          - In 1994, the President fought for and signed the Assault Weapons
          Ban into law as part of comprehensive crime legislation. When
                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
efforts to kill the ban were succeeding (August '94 vote on crime bill
rule), the President fought with the nation's law enforcement officers
to make sure the Assault Weapons Ban was not dropped from the
final bill. As a result, 19 specific assault weapons, duplicates of
those 19 firearms and certain other semiautomatic weapons
possessing various military style features were banned from
importation.

- In 1994, the President (when granting MFN status to China) used his
authority under the Arms Export Control Act to ban the importation
of Chinese munitions. By taking this action, he stopped the
potential importation of millions of assault-type rifles (SKS) and
high-capacity magazines.

(The Administration negotiated a voluntary restraint agreement with
the Russians to limit the number of firearms, clips and ammunition
coming into the country as a result of increased trade with Russia).
NB: need to confirm date/details of this agreement.

- And, both in 1996 and 1997, the Administration worked to defeat
congressional amendments to force the importation of military
surplus firearms. These military weapons, which were provided to
foreign governments for free or at low costs -- and by the millions,
included concealable handguns (.45 caliber semiautomatic pistols)
and rifles that could be easily converted into fully automatic
weapons (MI carbines).
