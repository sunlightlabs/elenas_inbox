                            DATE:             June 25, 1997
                            LOCATION:   Vanderbilt University
                                               Langford Auditorium
                            EVENT TIME:       1:00pm-2:15pm
                            FROM:             Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      To highlight your commitment to improving education and to increasing family
      involvement in education. You will announce that the Department of Education will be
      releasing a handbook on how to create school compacts.

II.   BACKGROUND

      This is the third family conference you have attended, and the sixth family conference the
      Vice President has held. The conference is entitled "Family Re-Union 6: Families and
      Learning," and it will focus on family involvement in education.The Child and Family
      Policy Center at the Vanderbilt University for Public Policy Studies and the Children,
      Youth and Family Consortium at the University of Minnesota are co-sponsors of the
      event. The conference will be broadcast live via satellite throughout the country.

      In your address, you will be announcing that the Department of Education will be
      releasing a pUblication entitled, A Compact for Learning: An Action Handbook for
      School-Family Community Partnerships. School compacts are required for schools
      that participate in the Title I program to ensure strong parental involvement, but can be a
      powerful tool for all schools that seek to raise student achievement. The handbook
      provides step-by-step strategies, examples, and checklists on how to create an effective
      school compact, how to use a school compact, and how to strengthen and improve a
      school compact over time, based on results. The published version of the handbook will
      be available in late summer, and copies may be reserved by calling the Department of
      Education and will also be available on the Department's World Wide Web site.

      You and the Vice President will be leading a discussion designed to show the stages in
      developing family involvement in leaming. The first three panelists will give vivid
      examples of local programs, the second three will discuss ways of expanding these
      strategies on a large scale, the following two panelists will describe strategies for

                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
       federal, state, and local policy that facilitates this change.

       Prior to your arrival the Vice President will make a formal address and will announce the
       following:
              Findings from a parent survey sponsored by the Department of Education, the
               Family Involvement Partnership for Education, and GTE.

             Establishment of a new partnership to train teachers on parental involvement, with
              a kickoff teleconference on effective use of technology set for this fall.

             Creation of a privately financed school reform fund that would provide grants to
              "start-up," "speed-up," and "turnaround" public schools.

             Announcement of a new technology tool -- an "electronic dashboard" -- that
              parents could use to get important information about their child's school (school
              standards, events, homework assignments, etc.) and their child's performance, and
              to communicate with other parents and teachers.

       After the Vice Presidents remarks, prior to your arrival a short film of t.v. and movie clips
       on the subject of families and learning will be shown. Jeff Cole from UCLA provided
       this film -- which is similar to his film that was shown at last year's conference.
       Following the collage, the VP will lead an hour long conversation with six individuals
       about the impact of learning from their families on their lives. These participants
       include, James Comer, Yale Child Study Center, Hieding Carter, Publisher and former
       Assistant Secretary of State, a father and son from inner city Baltimore who have worked
       to involve poor urban families actively with their children, Gayle Ross, a Cherokee story
       teller, and Phon Malaikham, a young Laotian refugee who is now a teacher in Tennessee.
       Following this panel, the audience will be shown a moving documentary produced by the
       Boston University Film school with Children of differeing ages discussing their families
       involvement or lack of involvement in their shchools.
