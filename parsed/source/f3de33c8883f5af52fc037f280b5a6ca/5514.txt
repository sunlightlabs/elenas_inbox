MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:       Reforms that Prepare Medicare for the Retirement of the Baby Boom
               Generation

Overview

       The Balanced Budget Act that you enacted took critically necessary steps to modernize
the Medicare program and prepare it for the twenty-first century. It extended the life of the
Trust Fund to 2010, invested in preventive benefits, provided more choice of plans for
beneficiaries, strengthened our ongoing fraud activities, and lowered cost growth to slightly
below the private sector through provider payment reforms and modest beneficiary payment
increases. However, the Balanced Budget's policies do not address the long-term problems
posed by the retirement of the baby boom generation.

       The Medicare Commission was established to address the demographic challenges facing
the program. However, a major policy and political question remains. Is there anything we can
and should do prior to the March 1999 Commission deadline that could further strengthen the
program and lay the groundwork for implementation oflikely Commission recommendations?

        The National Economic Council (NEC) and Domestic Policy Council (DPC) have led an
interagency examination of several, targeted policy options. We examine options for coverage
for pre-65 year olds, the income-related premium, and a project to increase awareness of private
long-tetm care. In addition, our efforts to both improve benefits and promote research are
combined in a proposal to cover the patient care costs of clinical cancer trials.

        Your advisors have not reached consensus on the best policies or financing mechanisms
for these options, much less on agreement whether we should pursue these at all. OMB and to
some extent Treasury have concems about a pre-65 option, because it may open the door to
subsidies for a costly population and have the unintended effect of reducing employer coverage.
Both OMB and Treasury feel negatively about the clinical cancer trials proposal since it could set
a precedent for every other disease group asking for the same treatment. In addition, it may well
be the case, that the traditional Medicare savings available will not be sufficient to offset the
costs of these proposals. As such, a decision to propose a pre-65 policy may be feasible only if
the decision is made to propose an income-related premium or, much less likely, dollars from any
residual tobacco savings. It is worth noting that an income-related premium would clearly be
more politically viable to our Democratic base if it were linked to a benefit enhancement.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
A.     PRE-65 HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS

        People between 55 and 65 years old often face greater problems accessing affordable
health insurance. They are at greater risk of having health problems, with twice the probability
of experiencing heart disease, strokes and cancer as people ages 45 to 54. Yet their access to
affordable employer coverage is often lower due to work and family transitions. Work transition
increase as people approach 65, with many retiring or shifting to part-time work or
self-employment as a bridge to retirement. Some of this transition is involuntary. Nearly half
of people 55 to 65 years old who lose their jobs due to firms downsizing or closing do not get
re-employed. Family transitions also reduce access to employer-based health insurance for the
increased number of people who are widowed, divorced, or whose spouse has gotten Medicare
and retired. As a result, the pre-65 year olds, more than any other age group, rely upon the
individual health insurance market. Without the advantages of having their costs averaged with
other younger people (as in employer-based insurance), these people often face relatively high
premiums and, because of the practice of medical underwriting, may be unable to get coverage at
any price if they h~ve pre-existing medical conditions.

         These access problems will increase due to two trends: the decline in retiree health
coverage and the aging of the baby boom generation. Recently, firms have cut back on offering
pre-65 retirees health coverage; only 40 percent oflarge firms now offer such coverage. In
addition, in several small but notable cases (e.g., General Motors and Pabst Brewery), retirees'
health benefits were dropped unexpectedly, despite the firm's commitment to the workers.
These "broken promise" retirees do not have access to COBRA continuation coverage and could
have difficultly finding affordable individual insurance. A more important trend is the
demographics. The number of people 55 to 65 years old will to increase to 30 million by 2005
and 35 million by 2010 - over a 50 percent increase. This could raise the number of uninsured
in this age group from 3 million today to 4 million by 2005, not even taking into account the
decline in retiree health coverage.

Policy Questions

      Two central questions guide policy decisions in this area: what is the target population,
and what is the best way to cover these people.

        Who to Target. As with any incremental reform, targeting is essential to ensure that the
policy does not unintentionally reduce employer health coverage. In this case, the concern is
that a broad and generous policy could both encourage people to retire earlier or accelerate the
decline in employer contributions and/or coverage. At the same time, the current level of
employer dropping suggests that a policy for the affected people is needed. Although your
advisors remain divided on the advisability of implementing a new policy in this area, we all
agree that if you decide to move in this direction that any policy should include protections
against substitution. The easiest way to accomplish this is limiting eligibility to a subset of the
pre-65 year olds. There are two design approaches worthy of consideration.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
        The first approach is to limit eligibility by age. We recommend an age break of 62. The
6 million people age 62 to 65, compared to people ages 55 to 59, work less (x percent versus y
percent), ar~ more likely to have fair to poor health (26 versus 20 percent), and are more likely to
be uninsured or buy individual insurance (28 versus 21 percent). In addition, it is also the age at
which Social Secuiity benefits can be accessed. Within this group, we could limit eligibility to
those without access to employer or public insurance, and would require that they exhaust
COBRA coverage before becoming eligible, to limit the incentive to retire or drop retiree
coverage due to this option.

        A second approach is to limit eligibility within the 55 to 65 year olds by a group's lack of
access to employer-based insurance. Three groups have particular problems. (1) Displaced
workers: About 60,000 people ages 55 to 65 lost their employer insurance when they became
displaced workers (lost their job due to the firm closing, downsizing, etc). Only about
one-thirds of these people get re-employed. (2) Medicare spouses: About 420,000 uninsured
people are spouses (mostly wives) of Medicare beneficiaries. They may have lost employer
coverage when their husbands turned 65 and retired. (3) "Broken promise" people: A small
but vulnerable group is the pre-65 retirees who lose retiree health coverage due to a ''broken
promise" (employer unexpectedly terminates coverage).

        How to Target. The second question is: what is the best way to increase access to
affordable insurance? One approach is to e~tend COBRA continuation coverage for longer than
18 months. Currently, COBRA allows workers with insurance in firms with 20 or more
employees (COBRA exempts small firms) to continue that coverage for 18 months by paying
102 percent of the premium. The major problems with this approach are that not all people are
eligible, businesses will consider this an unfunded mandate, and such a policy could lead to
discriminate against hiring older workers. In addition, firms that do not want to cover their
employees anyway could use this COBRA mandate as their excuse not to do so. Despite these
difficulties, a COBRA extension appears to be the best option for the "broken promise" people,
since the former employer would bear some of the costs of their decision to terminate coverage.

        A second option, preferable for most of the target groups, is a Medicare ''buy-in'' ..
Eligible people could buy into Medicare at the age-adjusted Medicare managed care payment
rate, with an add-on for the extra risk of participants. Since the actuaries think that most
participants will be sicker than average, this add-on will be costly. To attract healthier people
and thus reduce the add-on, we could "amortize" it, meaning that the participant would pay it in
installments with their Part B premium after they turn 65, not all at once. In other words,
Medicare would pay part of the premium up front, with the beneficiaries paying back this amount
over time. The HCFA Actuaries have estimated that this Medicare "loan" in a worse-case
scenario would cost $1.1 billion per year (this estimate assumes participation of no more than
300,000 people). Because they assumed only sick people would participate, that all 300,000
would enroll in one year, and because they did not take into account the pay-back from
beneficiaries, the official estimates, expected next week, will probably be lower.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
Policy Options and Preferences

        Option 1. "Broken Promise" People Only. All your advisors recommend a policy to
require employers who break their promise of retiree coverage allow those retirees to buy into
their active employer plan at a rate of 150 percent of the premium (since this age group is more
expensive) until age 65. This option has no cost to the Federal government.

        Option 2. Medicare Buy-In for Select Groups. The second option is to allow a
limited group of 55 to 65 year olds to buy into Medicare. OMB and Treasury favor the
Medicare spouses - primarily uninsured women ages 55 to 65 whose husbands are already on
Medicare. OMB favors only this and the "broken promise" option. They argue that if the goal
is a limited test of a buy-in for the pre-65 year olds, this is a discrete group whose eligibility
would likely have no effect on the general trend in retiree health coverage or retirement. Labor
strongly supports policies to help displaced workers, since it fits with the broader theme of trying
to improve the security of workers. While a Medicare buy-in would help more of these workers,
in the absence of a buy-in, Labor would support a COBRA extension. HHS supports covering
these select groups but is concemed that the enrollment be sufficient enough to justify the
administrative expenses. The fact that there will be low numbers of participants for these
selected groups also means that the costs will be small.

        Option 3. Medicare Buy-In for 62 to 65 years old plus selected groups. The third
option is to limit eligibility to age 62 to 65 years old plus the Medicare spouses and displaced
workers. HHS and NECIDPC think that this is a narrow enough group to limit significantly the
effects on retiree health coverage or retirement. It also is more representative of the 65 to 67
year old population, giving a better sense of what would happen if Medicare eligibility were
postponed to 67 years old. Although Treasury is concerned that this policy could become an
underfinanced policy expansion, some of its concerns would be allayed if the buy-in participants
were enrolled only in managed care. This would assure that the insurers and not Medicare
would bear the risk. The cost of this option is not known yet but is likely to be less than $5
billion over 5 years.

       It is important to note that we are still waiting for the detailed analysis of these options
from the Office ofthe Actuary. That will give all advisors a better sense of the implications of
the choices and could alter recommendations.                             .
B.     ACCESS TO PRIVATE LONG-TERM CARE OPTIONS                             Hex-Dump Conversion

         A second idea to improve access to insurance focuses on long-tenn care. Unlike acute
care, long-tenn care is not primarily financed by private insurance, which only pays 6 percent of
its costs. Medicaid pays for 38 percent, Medicare pays for 16 percent, and families pay for
one-third of the costs out of pocket. This large government role may not be sustainable as the
baby boom generation retires. Today, one in four people over age 85 live in a nursing home.
This could increase substantially as the proportion of elderly living to age 90 is projected to
increase from 25 percent to 42 percent by 2050. Thus, it is important to encourage the
development of private insurance options. The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation took a step in
this direction by clarifying that long-tenn care insurance was deductible. However, given
people's general lack of understanding about the importance oflong-tenn care insurance, more
action is needed.

Information on Quality Private Long-Term Care Insurance

        We propose to leverage our role in Medicare to improve the quality of and access to
private policies. Medicare woulq allow certain private long-term care policies to be included in
its general information on Medicare managed care. HCFA would work with insurers, state
regulators; and other interested parties to develop a set of minimum standards. If a plan met
these standards, it could be included in the new managed care information system. As a
reminder, the BBA 1997 included provisions to provide annual information on managed care
choices to beneficiaries. This proposal would build upon that system and would cost up to $25
million over 5 years, distinct from the user fees are currently authorized for the managed care
information ..

         Some of your advisors think that this is an important first step, although there needs to be
more discussion of its details. There is some concern at HHS that coming to an agreement on a
set of standards could be difficult and that insurers may argue that our standards drive up the cost
of the policies, making them unaffordable. However, these concerns may not be insurmountable
with input from the industry.
C.     MEDICARE COVERAGE OF CANCER CLINICAL TRIALSHex-Dump Conversion

        We have developed a proposal that would expand Medicare to cover additional services
associated with cancer clinical trials. Today, Medicare does not cover the patient care costs
associated with these trials. This proposal would not only help Medicare beneficiaries, who·
represent a significant portion of cancer patients, but w·ould encourage the private industry to
cover clinical trials for the people less than 65 years old. It would also almost inevitably
increase participation in cancer clinical trials and would be particularly helpful for trials for
cancers, such as prostate cancer, that have inadequate treatments and have difficulty attracting
participants. Because of the way our actuaries score this proposal (CBO would score it for less
costs) and because we wanted to ensure we would be reimbursing for high quality trials, we have
had to narrow our original proposal to a level that may not be uniformly embraced by the
advocates. It is, however, likely to be supported (with some increased funding) by Senators
Mack and Rockefeller. Having said this, our current proposal is still quite expensive and its
opponents (in and outside the Administration) will criticize its precedence-setting potential to
expand to other diseases, and in so doing, tap the Medicare Trust Fund at precisely the wrong
time.

Background

         Scientists and advocates alike agree that we are simply not making sufficient progress in
treating cancer and that weaknesses in our current cancer clinical trials system are a significant
part of this problem. A major problems is the lack of insurance coverage of the health care
services associated with the trials. Nearly half of all cancer patients are covered by Medicare,
yet Medicare does not cover clinical trial patient care. This care can often be prohibitively
expensive for cancer patients and their families. This may explain why only 3 percent of all
cancer patients participate in trials. To illustrate the important of coverage, historically most
insurers have covered clinical trials for children. As a consequence, nearly 70 percent of children
with cancer participate in clinical trials. Scientists agree that this fact has helped improve cancer
treatments for children, and some argue that this is one reason for the dramatically higher
survival rates for children cancer patients.

        This problem has significant implications for research in all cancer areas, particularly for
those cancers such as prostate cancer where scientists still do not have good answers about .
treatment and where clinical trials are particularly undersubscribed. According to one former
National Cancer Institute director, if 10 percent of all cancer patients participated in such trials,
then trials that currently take three to five years would only take one year. Thi"s would likely
accelerate the improvements of treatments.

        Expanding Medicare to cover cancer clinical trials would represent an important step for
two reasons. First, all Americans covered by Medicare, not just those with resources, would
have a choice of participating in cancer trials. Second, as the nation's largest insurer, Medicare
plays a significant role in setting the standard for the insurance companies. A commitment from
Medicare to cover clinical trials would go a long way in encouraging private insurance
companies for the less than 65 year olds to agree to cover these trials.

                                                  6
Proposal
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
        In response to the interest in the breast and prostate cancer patient advocate community,
we have developed a proposal to expand Medicare to cover cancer clinical trials conducted at the
National Cancer Institute and trials with comparable peer review. This initiative would cost
$1.7 billion over five years and would be paid for by a variety of Medicare anti-fraud offsets.
There are options that cover a larger percentage of clinical trials, including a bill proposed by
Senator Mack and Senator Rockefeller (co-sponsored by 26 Senators). This proposal may be
too expansive by covering all FDA trials, many of which the experts believe do not meet a
scientifically-meritorious standard. However, there are some trials above the $1.7 billion
proposals that could justifiably be included, but for costs .

. Discussion

        There is no question that this proposal is the highest priority for most of the cancer
community as well as many in the women's community who believe this is an essential step to
improve breast cancer treatment. However, the advocates have made it clear that they would
strongly prefer the more expansive and expensive RockefellerlMack approach. We are working
to determine whether we can modify our more limited proposal in a way that they would support.

        HHS is supportive of this policy. OMB and Treasury, however, strongly oppose this
proposal because they believe it is bad policy and sets an almost unstoppable precedence. They
argue that the drug companies and other entities conducting the trials should pick up the patient
care costs as well. They also believe that once we cover cancer trials, we will be under
enormous pressure to cover other trials such as diabetes or heart disease.

        While the DPCINEC believes that OMB and Treasury raise valid concerns, we would
support this proposal if we can develop an affordable option that both Senator Rockefeller and
Senator Mack and the cancer community would strongly support. If we cannot obtain such
support in short order, we would recommend not including it in the budget. We would be in a
very good position to argue our likely support for a significant increase in biomedical research
will also pay large dividends in cancer breakthroughs and are more than sufficient in this budget
year. Finally, if it becomes clear that our final cost estimates for the Medicare buy-in are low
enough to be financed by the available $2 billion in traditional (anti-fraud) Medicare savings, the
DPC and NEC would recommend giving serious consideration to use these limited dollars to
support the Medicare buy-in proposal.

        D.     INCOME-RELATED PREMIUM

               It is likely the combination of all of these proposals, particularly the pre-65 coverage
L   .   initiative, will cost more than traditional Medicare savings could produce. This may lead to
        discussions of an income-related premium. As you know, Medicare subsidizes 75 percent of the
        Part B premium for all beneficiaries, including the wealthiest. This is not only regressive; it
        ignores the fact that studies show that higher income beneficiaries actually cost Medicare more
        than poor beneficiaries. However, this is moving away from the concept of social insurance.

        Policy Options

                Building from our position from last summer, the income-related premium would be
        administered by the Treasury Department, not HCFA or the Social Security Administration.
        Annually, eligible people would fill out a Medicare Premium Adjustment form (a separate form
        or a line on the 1040 form) and send a check to "The Medicare Trust Fund". The two open
        questions are: who pays and how much do they pay.

               Who qualifies. Last summer, the Senate passed a policy where the extra premium
        payment began at $50,000 for singles and $65,000 for couples. However, we proposed higher
        thresholds in the Health Security Act: $90,000 for singles and $115,000 for couples. These
        thresholds determine how many people are paying the higher amount.

                How much is the extra amount. The amount of the payment for the wealthiest
        beneficiaries is a second question. In the budget debate, we argued that would should not go to
        a 100 percent premium (no subsidy) because that could cause some healthy and wealthy people
        to opt out of Medicare. However, an analysis by the Treasury Department this fall found that the
        effects would be small (about 5% of beneficiaries who pay the full premium would drop). HHS
        would strongly object to changing our position and supporting an income-related premium that
        completely phases out the Part B subsidy. If we decided to change our past policy, it might be
        advisable to have a strategic discussion about the timing of announcing such a change. It could
        be an important in negotiating the give and take on this issue. Revenue will likely be at least $8
        billion over 5 years, depending on the policy.

        Discussion

               From a policy perspective, OMB and Treasury continue to support this policy, and would
        probably recommend that we begin at the $50,000 / $65,000 level and fully phase out the subsidy
        [check]. HHS believes that if an income-related premium is pursued, its savings are used for
        Medicare. They argue that Medicare has already contributed $115 billion in savings and that we
        should wait for the Commission recOmmendations before the next round of major changes_

                 From DPCINEC's perspective, it is a matter of balance. On one hand, it is almost certain
        that this policy will be recommended by the Medicare Commission. At that point, however, we
        will have no opportunity to direct any of its revenue toward important Medicare reforms like a
        Medicare buy-in. In addition, between the baseline and policy reductions, it is highly unlikely

                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
     that there will be enough health savings in the future to redirect toward coverage initiatives. If
     we do not pursue the premium and have insufficient funding for coverage initiatives, this will be
     the first time that your budget will not include a new coverage expansion initiative, with the
     exception of the period in which we were developing and debating Health Security. Act.

             On the other hand, we need to seriously consider the fact that many Democrats and
     possibly AARP would oppose the income-related premium for the same reason HHS cites.
     The one exception to this rule is if it is explicitly linked to the pre-65 policy. In addition,
     Republicans might take this opportunity to label this as a new tax and use it as an issue during
     the 1998 campaign. Even ifhe philosophically supports the premium, Speaker Gingrich might
     use the high-income premium's ''tax'' label as cover for his likely opposition to a Medicare
     buy-in.
