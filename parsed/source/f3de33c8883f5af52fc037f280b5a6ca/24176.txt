         Unified surplus projected for 2002 to 2026. Between 2002 and 2007, unified surplus is
          "working man" surplus. In 2008, non-trust component of budget shifts to surplus.

         The surpluses raise national saving, which helps to raise productivity in the future and
          therefore ease the bur~en on future workers imposed by demographic trends.

Options

1.        Bolster the Social Security Trust Fund

A)        Alternatives:

                 Purchase Treasury securities
                  -- Has same economic effects as retiring government debt
                  -- Would extend the life ofthe Trust Fund
                  -- Under current scoring rules, leaves surplus on the books

                 Purchase private securities
                  -- Would extend the life of the Trust Fund significantly
                  -- Market risks and "social" investing concerns
                  -- Would eliminate the surplus

B)        Key issues

                 Whether elite leaders would view as increase in national saving, or as. accounting
                  maneuver.

                 Could emphasize down-payment, not complete solution. Present plan (e.g.,
                  commission or high-level group to report by January 1999) for effecting other
                  steps.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
2: Fund individual retirement accounts

This option would use the unified surplus to fund a set of mandatory individual retirement
accounts. If creating private accounts does not affect individuals' behavior any differently than
bolstering Social Security, the effect on national saving would be the same as above -- but private
saving would be higher and public saving would be lower.

A)     Key elements:

              Funding tied to surplus

              Progressive as possible -- progressive match or system not linked to wages. For
               example: 1 percent of wages, plus lump sum per person depending on size of
               surplus (e.g., 1 percent of wages, plus $500 per person).

B)     Policy issues:

              Administrative costs

              Market risk: Risk borne by individuals, not shared by society as a whole

              Pressures that could reduce national saving:
               -- Withdraw early for special needs?
               -- For employers to reduce pensions?

              Pressure to reduce future role of government

              Support for Social Security: Will private accounts undermine support for S.S.?

              Government involvement: Should some government entity manage the accounts,
               as under Thrift Savings Plan?

C)     Political issues

             Will approach be seen as partial privatization and split Democrats?

             How closely should the approach be tied to "Social Security"? Separation could
              reduce problem for Dems. But Social Security "problem" then remains.

D)     Allow withdrawals for layoffs

             Could define a new type of social security

             Pressure to be expanded for medical care, home purchases, etc.
                                                             . Hex텱ump Conversion
3. Social Security and retirement needs exclusively

A)     100 percent of surplus for Social Security Trust Fund, but leave open Treasury versus
       private securities. 100 percent of surplus as down-payment on Social Security, with
       commission or bipartisan process to decide split between Treasury securities and private
       securities. Could be linked with broader Social Security reform effort, with reporting
       date by January 1999.

B)     Leave split between Trust Fund and individual accounts undecided at this point. Declare
       that 100 percent of the SUrplus would be used for helping to address demographic and
       retirement challenges, but leave split between Trust Fund and individual accounts to be
       decided by commission or bipartisan process.

C)     50 percent Social Security, 50 percent individual accounts. Specify now that 50 percent
       of the SUrplus would be used for the Trust Fund, and 50 percent for individual accounts.
       Decide now or later the details of both.

4. Mix Social Security with other priorities

       Another approach would be to expand the potential uses of the surplus beyond Social
Security and retirement. The advantage of such a broader approach is that it allows us to
address other priorities; the cost is that it blurs the message.

Illustrative example: One illustrative example would be to use 50 percent of the surplus for the
Social Security Trust Fund, 25 percent for tax reform (which could include individual accounts),
and 25 percent for an Investment in the Future fund.
