Per my conversations with Rahm and Elena this weekend, here's a first-cut
at the proposed one-pager for Wednesday's event in LA.  While I recognize
that it needs to be cleaned up -- not a lot of inspirational text -- it
should serve as an outline for Rahm to talk to Riordan and to see what he
thinks of the overall announcement.

Based on my conversation with DOJ today, the Brady reg should be fine for
Wednesday, but somebody should push the OMB folks at Monday's senior staff
to tell DOJ to get it out by then.

                                     August 12,1998

Today, with Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles and California Lt. Governor Gray Davis,
President Clinton will issue a bipartisan call for Congress to strengthen -- and not undermine --
the tough laws that have worked to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. The President will:
(1) announce the publication of a proposed regulation to fully implement the Brady Law; (2)
strongly support legislation to ban the transfer oflarge capacity military magazines; and (3)
oppose Congressional efforts to expand the carrying of concealed weapons across state lines ..

Defending the Brady Law

      Final implementation of the Brady Law. Despite the gun lobby's attempts to derail
       implementation of the Brady Law's National Instant Criminal Background Check System
       (NICS), the Administration will publish a proposed regulation to implement the NICS on
       November 30, 1998. Among other things, this regulation will allow the FBI to charge
       gun dealers the same fee it charges day care provides and others for similar background
       checks -- guaranteeing that the FBI will have the resources it needs to operate the NICS.

      Making Permanent the Brady Law's Requirements. Although the NICS will make
       many more records of ineligible gun purchasers available in mere seconds, it will also
       replace a network of 5,400 state and local law enforcement officials that have stopped an
       estimated 242,000 prohibited purchasers from buying a handgun. To make sure all
       Americans have the benefit of the best background check system possible, the President
       supports legislation to make permanent the Brady Law's requirements by: (1) requiring a
       minimum 3-day waiting period for all handgun purchases; (2) adding up to an additional
       2 days to the waiting period if law enforcement officers need more time to clarify arrest
       records; and (3) continuing to require gun dealers to notify designated law enforcement
       officials of all proposed handgun purchases. Congress should pass such legislation
       before it adjourns, so all Americans can benefit from the best background check system
       possible.

Banning Assault Weapons and Military Magazines

      Closing the Clips Loophole. The Assault Weapons Ban that passed as part of the 1994
       Crime Act prohibited the future importation, manufacture and sale of magazines
       accepting more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Nearly 4 years later, however, it is
       estimated that hundreds of thousands of pre-Ban clips continue to be bought and sold.
       The intent of the Assault Weapons Ban was to end the easy access to these large capacity
       military magazines (LCMMs). Today, President Clinton will support legislation,
       introduced by Senator Feinstein, to ban -- once and for all-- the transfer of these military
       magazines that are used with assault-type weapons.

      LCMM Rifles and Clips Recently Banned from Importation. This past April, the
       Treasury Department concluded that more than 50 kinds of modified assault weapons --


                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
      generally not importable because they accept LCMMs. Consistent with its obligation to
      restrict the importation of firearms unless they are determined to be "particularly suitable
      for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes," the Treasury Department concluded that
      LCMM rifles and clips -- did not meet the sporting purposes test and were generally not
      importable.

Fighting Gun Lobby Efforts to Undermine State and Federal Laws

     Carrying Concealed Weapons Across State Lines. Last Wednesday, the House
      Judiciary Committee quietly passed a bill that -- under the guise of allowing police
      officers to carry their firearms across state lines -- could allow millions of persons with
      state permits to carry a concealed weapons to do so throughout most parts of the country.
      Currently, 43 of the 50 states issue permits for concealed weapons and could be impacted
      by this legislation. While there may be good reasons to allow law enforcement officers
      to carry their service weapons across state lines, allowing millions of others traveling
      out-of-state to carry concealed and loaded weapons can only serve to undermine state and
      federal gun laws -- and will be strongly opposed by the President.


NB: Rahm wanted to see what a bullet on these crime funds, which can be released next
Wednesday, would like. We have generally downplayed this as the R's block grant -- and
Bruce didn't seem to think it was on message -- but here it is.


Releasing Crime Control Funds for California

     Local Law Enforcement Block Grant. President Clinton will also announce the
      release of $78.8 million in crime fighting funds for California -- including $18.1 million
      for the City of Los Angeles and $3.7 million for the County of Los Angeles. Generally,
      these funds can be used to: hire and train additional police officers; procure equipment
      and technology for law enforcement use; enhance security in and around schools;
      establish drug courts; adjudicate violent offenders, including violent juveniles; establish
      task forces of federal and local enforcement; and promote cooperative crime prevention
      between community residents and police officers.
