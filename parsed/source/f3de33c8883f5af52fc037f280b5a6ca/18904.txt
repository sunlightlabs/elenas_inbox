    PRESIDENT CLINTON RELEASES NEW REPORT AND URGES CONGRESS TO PASS
    PATIENT BILL OF RIGHTS, COMPREHENSIVE TOBACCO LEGISLATION, AND THE
                         MEDICARE BUY-IN PROPOSAL
                                 March 9, 1998

In a speech to the American Medical Association (AMA) today, the President renewed his call to
Congress to pass a patients' bill of rights, comprehensive tobacco legislation to reduce teen smoking,
and his proposal to allow hundreds of thousands of Americans ages 55 to 65 to buy into Medicare. In
his speech, which marks the first time a President has spoken to the AMA in fifteen years, President
Clinton highlighted that he and the AMA are united on the need for a patients' bill of rights and
tobacco legislation, and urged the AMA to lend its strong support to his Medicare buy-in proposal.
Underscoring the bipartisan support for a patients' bill of rights, the President released a report
showing that 44 states -- including 28 states with Republican Governors -- have enacted the "Consumer
Bill of Rights" that the President's Quality Commission recommended and the President endorsed last
year. In his speech, the President:

RELEASED NEW REPORT SHOWING THAT 44 STATES -- INCLUDING 28 STATES
WITH REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS -- HAVE ENACTED AT LEAST ONE OF THE
PROVISIONS IN THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS. The President released a new report that
underscores the bipartisan support for the patients' bill of rights he endorsed last year. Highlights from
this report are as follows:

      Forty-four states have enacted at least one of protections in the patients' bill of rights.

      Patient protection laws have been enacted by Democratic and Republican Governors
       alike. Twenty-eight of the 32 states with Republican Governors have enacted at least one of
       these protections.

      Each of these patient protections has been enacted in at least eight states around the
       country and some have been enacted in as many as forty-one states. For example:

               Twenty-eight states -- including 16 with Republican Governors -- have enacted
               protections to assure access to emergency room services.

               Thirty states -- including 15 with Republican Governors -- have enacted protections to
               give direct access to certain specialists, including access to qualified specialists for
               women's health services.

URGED CONGRESS TO PASS FEDERAL LEGISLATION BECAUSE, DESPITE STATE
LAWS, STATES HAVE NO JURISDICTION OVER MORE THAN 100 MILLION
AMERICANS. A patchwork of non-comprehensive state laws cannot provide Americans with the
protections they need -- especially because state laws do not even have jurisdiction over more than 100
million Americans. For example, they do not cover tens of millions of Americans in self-insured
plans covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The only way to ensure
that all health plans serving all Americans provide the protections envisioned by the Quality
Commission is to pass and enact bipartisan Federal legislation.
YEAR. The President also reiterated his call for Congress to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation
this year that includes his five key principles:

      A comprehensive plan to reduce youth smoking, including: significant price increases; tough
       penalties on tobacco firms that continue to market to youths; public education and counter
       advertising; and expanded efforts to restrict access and limit appeal.

      Full authority of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.

      Changes in how the tobacco industry does business, including an end to marketing and
       promotion to children and broad document disclosure.

      Progress towards other public goals, including a reduction of secondhand smoke; promotion of
       cessation programs; public health research; and the strengthening of international efforts to
       control tobacco.

      Protection for tobacco farmers and their communities.

REITERATED THAT THIS TOBACCO PROPOSAL COULD PREVENT UP TO ONE
MILLION PREMATURE DEATHS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. The recent Treasury
Department's study, based on conservative estimates from well-respected analytical models, concluded
that the Administration's proposal to increase the price of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack -- coupled with
proposed sales and advertising restrictions -- would:

      Keep up to 1.9 million Americans from smoking in 2003 -- a 39 to 46 percent reduction in
       youth smoking. Over the next five years, the cumulative number of young people kept from
       smoking would be up to 2.8 million.

      The direct result of these policies over the next five years is that as many as 1 million oftoday's
       young people will be spared from premature deaths resulting from smoking-related diseases.

URGED CONGRESS TO ACT NOW TO PASS HIS TARGETED PROPOSAL TO GIVE
AMERICANS AGES 55 TO 65 ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE.

      Americans ages 55 to 65 are one of the most difficult to insure popUlations: they have less
       access to and a greater risk oflosing employer-based health insurance; and they are twice as
       likely to have health problems.

      The President has a carefully-targeted, fiscally-responsible proposal that would allow
       hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Americans to gain access to more affordable health
       care coverage by: allowing Americans ages 62 to 65 to buy into the Medicare program;
       allowing displaced workers age 55 and over a similar buy-in option; and allowing Americans
       55 and over who have lost their retiree health benefits to buy into their former employers'
       health plan.

      The Congressional Budget Office just confirmed that this proposal will help hundreds of
       thousands of Americans without burdening the Medicare Trust Fund or the budget.
 STATES HAVE ENACTED EACH OF THE PATIENT PROTECTIONS HE HAS ENDORSED
         -- INCLUDING MANY STATES WITH REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS
                              March 9, 1998


    Thirty-four states -- including 21 states with Republican Governors -- have enacted
     information disclosure provisions. At least 34 states have enacted provisions that require
     health plans to disclose information to help consumers make informed decisions about their
     health plans, health professionals, and health facilities.

    Ten states have enacted provider network adequacy provisions -- including four states
     with Republican Governors. At least ten states have enacted provisions to help ensure that
     health plan networks provide access to sufficient numbers and types of providers without
     unreasonable delay.

     Thirty states -- including 15 states with Republican Governors -- have enacted protections
     'to give direct access to certain specialists, including qualified specialists for women's
      health services. At least 30 states have enacted provisions to give patients greater access to
      needed specialists, including giving women greater access to qualified specialists for women's
      health services.

    Seventeen states have enacted continuity of care protections -- including ten states with
     Republican Governors. At least 17 states have enacted protections to help ensure continuity
     of care for enrollees who are involuntarily forced to change providers.

    Twenty-eight states have enacted protections to assure access to emergency room services
     -- including 16 states with Republican Governors. At least 28 states have enacted
     legislation to help ensure that patients have access to emergency room services when and where
     the need arises. These provisions require health plans to pay for the initial screening
     examination and stabilization care -- regardless of whether the emergency room is in the
     plan's network -- when an enrolled person needs emergency services. Twenty of these states
     require the use of a prudent layperson standard to determine whether an emergency exists, to
     ensure that any person who reasonably thought they were having an emergency is covered by
     their health plan.

.   Forty-one states have enacted anti-gag clauses -- including 26 states with Republican
     Governors. At least 41 states have enacted "anti-gag" clauses prohibiting health plans from
     using contract clauses that restrict providers' communications with their patients.

    Eighteen states have enacted provisions that require health plans to disclose financial
     incentives -- including 12 states with Republican Governors. At least 18 states have passed
     protections requiring health plans to disclose any financial arrangements with their physicians.

    Nineteen states have enacted provisions to protect confidentiality of health information --
     including ten states with Republican Governors. At least 19 states have enacted some type
     of provision to help protect the confidentiality of health information for health plan enrollees
       Republican Governors.

      Twelve states now require that health plan enrollees have access to an external appeal
       process, including eight states with a Republican Governor. At least 12 states now require
       that health plan enrollees have access to specially designated and independent external appeals
       entities, which are funded and empowered to hear and act upon such appeals.


Last November the President endorsed the "Consumer Bill of Rights" recommended by his Advisory
Commission on Quality and Consumer Protection. These rights included: information disclosure; a
choice of providers including provider network adequacy provisions, access to specialists (including
qualified specialists for women's health services), and transitional care provisions; access to emergency
room services; participation in treatment decisions including prohibiting anti-gag clauses and requiring
disclosure of financial incentives; protection of the confidentiality of health information;
anti-discrimination provisions; and access to an appeals process.
