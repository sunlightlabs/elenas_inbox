                                  TALKING POINTS FOR MR. BOWLES
                              REGARDING PRODUCT LIABILITY LEGISLATION




                     As you know, last year the President vetoed the product liability bill (H.R. 956) because
                      of several concerns:

                              First, the bill would have interfered in an area of traditional state responsibility in
                               a way that would have disadvantaged consumers -- it preempted state laws, but
                               only when the state law would have given consumers more favorable
                               treatment when suing to vindicate their rights. This kind of picking and
                               choosing amounts to a one-way street of federalism, and the President could not
                               abide it.

                              Second, it eliminated joint and several liability. The President did not agree
                               that it was okay for the injured consumer'to be left holding the bag when one of
                               the parties responsible for the injury could not pay.

                               Third, the President opposed the idea of arbitrarily capping punitive damages.

                              Fourth, the President believed it was inappropriate to shield from liability
                               suppliers of materials for products that end up being implanted in the human
                               body even if they knew that the materials would cause injury.

                    From the President's perspective, there are a lot of things that would need to be fixed to
                     overcome these concerns. Some of them may be too 'fundamental to the proponents of
                     the legislation to fix.

                    Nevertheless, we would want to engage on the legislation to explore whether these things
                                   could be fixed. We are too early in the process to have a fully formed
                                   view about whether that's possible; it's too early, even, to say whether we
                                   are pessimistic or optimistic.
