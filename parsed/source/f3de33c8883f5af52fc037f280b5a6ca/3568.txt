      TEXT:-
      Attached is a paper with some talking points:

      There appears to be another, fairly major option for addressing Waters'
      problem without a change in the law -- but we may not want to talk it up.
      States can choose to define these households as "child-only" cases under
      TANF, as Wisconsin has.  The time limit does not apply to child-only
      cases.  This trick has a more limited utility in getting around work
      requirements -- it allows you to exempt the grandparent from work, but
      child-only households are still counted in the denominator for the
      purposes of meeting the work requirements, so you have to make it up
      somewhere else in the caseload.

     States are free under TANF to create a child-only category for whatever
     slice of the population they wish, e.g., grandparents, those over a
     certain age, or even parents.  Presumably a state pays a lower benefit to
     a child-only case than to a two-person family, but that is not required.
     So TANF may encourage states to create more child-only categories --
     although there will be a countervailing political pressure to be tough on
     work.

     As CEA noted in its weekly report to the President last week, child-only
     cases are already a large and growing part of the case load, increasing
     from 9.6% in 1988 to 21.5% in 1996. The cause is unclear. Child-only
     cases include households where the parent is on SSI, where the parent is
     an illegal alien, or where the parent has been sanctioned, as well as
     cases where the caretaker was a relative not eligible for AFDC.

     By the way, Frank Raines is apparently interested in this as well, and has
     talked to Waters.  Therefore, Keith wants to come or send someone to the
     Waters meeting. ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

                               GrandparentlFamily Caregiver Exemption
                           from Welfare Work Requirements and Time Limits

    Summary of Grandparent and Family Caregiver Support Act: Would prohibit states from
    applying work requirements and time limits to grandparents and other family members caring for
    children on public assistance.

    Talking Points
          In welfare reform, we agreed to give states the discretion to identify their most vulnerable
           populations -- battered women, people with AIDS, those too disabled to work,
           grandparent caregivers -- and decide who would be exempt from time limits and work
           requirements.

                  The law allows states to exempt up to 20% of the caseload from time limits. The
                   maximum work requirement is 50% of the caseload beginning in 2002. States
                   also have some discretion to use state-only programs to help this group. [Note: we
                   shouldn't overemphasize this, since we've wanted to close this loophole.]

          In the current reconciliation debate, the Administration is opposing a number of proposals
           to weaken the work requirements. These include:

                  a reduction in required work hours for states whose benefits can't support
                   payment of the minimum wage; and
                  broadening the amount of vocational education that counts toward the work
                   requirements.

          There is also a real risk that this proposal would encourage parents to give their children
           over to grandparents or other relatives' care.

    Unrelated Note: The welfare law requires the Census Bureau to collect census data on
    grandparents who are primary caregivers for their grandchildren, with the Commerce Secretary
    required to take action to make this possible within 90 days after the law was signed. I am
    trying to leam if Commerce has done this, but I don't believe this would yield any data until the
    year 2000 census.
