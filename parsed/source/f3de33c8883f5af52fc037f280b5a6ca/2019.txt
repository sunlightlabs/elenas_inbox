Welfare Caseload Numbers

     Welfare caseloads have declined by 20 percent or nearly 2.8 million since President
      Clinton took office -- the largest decline in history. Welfare caseloads have fallen as
      much in the past four years as they increased during the first 25 years.

     Some of this decline in welfare caseloads can be attributed to President Clinton's
      successful economic policies, which created 12 million new jobs during his first four
      years in office.

     The decline in welfare rolls also demonstrates that welfare reform works. The lower
      caseloads are due in part to the waivers President Clinton granted to 43 states to allow
      them to impose tough work requirements and time limits and to provide incentives that
      make work pay better than welfare.

     Not only have welfare case loads gone down under President Clinton, but child support
      collections have gone up. During the last four years the Administration's child support
      enforcement crackdown helped increase collections by 50%, from $8 billion in 1992 to a
      record $12 billion in 1996.

Welfare Reform and the President's Budget Proposal

     The President signed the welfare bill into law because it restores American's basic
      bargain of providing opportunity and demanding in turn responsibility.

     The law also protects children by guaranteeing medical care and nutritional assistance and
      providing $14 billion for child care.

     When he signed the bill, the President said that he strongly opposes some of the budget
      cuts the Congressional leaders attached to the welfare reform bill, cuts that have nothing
      to do with the real goal of welfare reform -- putting people to work.

     The President's budget corrects these problems:

            Specifically, the President's budget restores SSI and Medicaid eligibility for legal
             immigrants who become disabled after entering the country; restores Medicaid
             eligibility for immigrant children; extends the refugee exemption period from 5 to
             7 years; and delays the Food Stamp ban until the end ofFY 1997, restoring a
             total of $14.6 billion in budget cuts.

            The President's budget includes tools to help fulfill the central goal of welfare
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
              reform -- moving people from welfare to work.

                     His budget includes a $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge fund for
                      cities and states to create jobs and provide incentives for employment.

                     Complementing this initiative is the President's proposed enhanced and
                      expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit. First, the tax credit would be
                      enhanced for long-term welfare recipients, allowing employers who hire
                      long-term welfare recipients to claim a 50 percent tax credit on the first
                      $10,000 of wages paid to that person for two years. Second, the WOTC
                      would be expanded to include 18- to SO-year-olds made ineligible for
                      food stamps under the new welfare law.

                     The President's budget plan also includes $600 million in transportation
                      funds for states and local entities to create new or modified transportation
                      services that ensure access to work for low-income workers.

Welfare to Work: A Public and Private Responsibility

The President has launched an aggressive campaign to challenge both the public and private
sector to help welfare reform succeed.

      First, the President has spoken to state legislatures to share the country's best welfare to
       work practices and to encourage states to rise to the challenge.

      Second, the President has enlisted business leaders in the welfare reform effort, soliciting
       pledges of help from major CEOs and working to build a larger network of business
       people who will hire welfare recipients.

      Third, the President is reaching out to nonprofits and the faith community, urging them to
       work with employers to help meet this challenge ..

      The President has committed the federal government to do its fair share to hire people
       from the welfare rolls. On April 10th the President held the first full Cabinet meeting of
       his second term in which federal agencies pledged to directly hire at least 10,000 welfare
       recipients over the next four years. In addition, most agencies will encourage their
       grantees and contractors to hire welfare recipients.
