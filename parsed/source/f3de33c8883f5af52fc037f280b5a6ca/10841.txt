     TEXT:
     Maria

     The news analysis below raises very important questions about chicago
     example,
     as I have told you. See also the front page NYT story today by Ethan,
     pointing
     out that the strong weight of the research evidence is .

     Of course, DPC insists it will be done the right way, like Chicago does.
     But
     look at the chicago practice as described below. This is bad for kids of
     color
     and that's why it is so important for those discussions with the Leadership
     Conference to be undertaken in good faith. (The meeting Bruce and Mike had
     was,
     I understand, teriffic, but didn't cover the issue of social promotions.)

     Finally, I respectfully request a copy of whatever has been given to POTUS
     describing the evidence on the Chicago experience, and characterizing the
     state
     of research and professional opinion on retention. I'm trying to figure out
     what he has been told about the civil rights objections, which are based
     on the
     social science evidence, rather than anecdote.

     Thanks.
