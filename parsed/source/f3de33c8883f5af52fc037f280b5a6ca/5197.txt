                 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON HATE CRIMES
                         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                            NOVEMBER 10, 1997

Q:   What is a hate crime?

A:   As a general matter, a hate crime, also known as a bias crime, is a crime that is
     committed against a person or property ,that is motivated, in whole or part, by the
     offender's bias against the victim's race, color, religion, gender, national origin, sexual
     orientation, disability, or familial status. However, it is important to understand that hate
     crimes are defined by various federal and state criminal statutes, and these statutory
     definitions differ in their particulars from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The principal
     federal hate crimes statute, for example, is limited to crimes committed because of the
     victim's race, color, religion or national origin; it does not include crimes committed
     because of the victim's gender, sexual orientation, or disability.

Q:   IS the President supporting an expansion of the defmition of a hate crime? Is he
     supporting changes to current federal law?

A:   I have called a conference on hate crimes for November 10, 1997. One of the issues that
     will be considered at the conference is whether the statutory definition of the principal
     federal hate crimes statute should be expanded.

Q:   What policy announcements will you make at the Hate Crimes Conference?

A:   I will make significant policy announcements regarding law enforcement and prevention,
     including initiatives regarding FBI resources, training for law enforcement officials, and
     statistical reporting.

Q:   Is the Hate Crimes Conference part of the Race Initiative?

A:   The Hate Crimes Conference addresses the same basic ideas behind the Race Initiative.
     In both cases, I would like to create a dialogue so that people can discuss the issue and
     learn about their differences. While the Hate Crimes Conference coincides with the Race
     Initiative in many ways, the Hate Crimes Conference encompasses more than racial
     differences but also differences in religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender, and
     disability. Members of the President's Initiative on Race are actively participating in the
     Hate Crimes Conference as well as at some of the 45 or so satellite sites across the
     country.


Q:   Is the Oklahoma City bombing case a hate crime? Is the President speaking out on
     hate crimes now because of the McVeigh and Nichols trials?

A:   It would be inappropriate for me to comment about the Oklahoma City bombing case,
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

     since Mr. McVeigh's case is on appeal and the Nichols trial is currentlypemding.
     However, this is an issue I have always felt strongly about. I believe that hate crimes are
     a scourge on our society as a whole, and that we need to get tough on hate.

Q:   Is the bombing of an abortion clinic a hate crime?

A:   It depends on the circumstances. If the bombing is motivated by the perpetrator's gender-
     based bias, then the crime could violate a hate crimes statute if the statute defines hate
     crimes to include this type of conduct when it is motivated by gender bias. The principal
     federal hate crimes statute currently does not prohibit conduct motivated by gender-based
     bias.


Q:   Why are there disparities in the hate crimes statistics reported? Why don't we know
     whether the number of hate crimes committed is going up or down?

A:   Hate crimes statistics vary widely because hate crimes are under reported. There are
             several reasons why this happens. First, hate crimes reporting by state and local
     law     enforcement agencies is voluntary under current law. Second, many of the most
     likely targets of hate crimes also are the least likely to report incidents to the police. For
             example, 60% of the victims of anti-gay incidents who reported their incidents to
     private        tracking groups did not report the incidents to the police, in many cases
     because of a fear      of mistreatment or unwanted exposure. Third, state and local
     jurisdictions often have        disincentives to classify and compile statistics relating to
     hate crimes. Tracking hate crimes      may require law enforcement agencies to do
     additional investigative work to determine the          motivation behind crimes.
     Nonetheless, the number of hate crimes actually reported톞o            the FBI has increased
     over the past several years, from 2,771 in 1991 to 7,947 in 1995.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

                        HATE CRIMES - BACKGROUND PAPER

Some Federal Statutes Relating to Hate Crimes

     18 U.S.C  245, the principal federal hate crimes statute, prohibits the use of force or
      threats of force against individuals because of their race, color, religion or national origin
      and because of their participation in one of the following six "federally protected
      activities:" (1) emolling in or attending public school or college, (2) participating in or
      enjoying any service, program, facility or activity provided or administered by any State
      or local government, (3) applying for or enjoying employment,(4) serving as a juror in
      state court, (5) traveling in or using any facility of interstate commerce, and (6) enjoying
      the goods or services of a place of public accommodation.

                    Section 245 has significant limitations: (1) the statute does not prohibit
                     conduct that is based on gender, sexual orientation, or disability, and (2) it
                     does not apply unless the victim is engaged in one of the enumerated
                     federally protected rights at the time of the offense.

     42 U.S.C.  3631, enacted in 1968 as part of the Fair Housing Act, prohibits
      housing-related violence based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, disability,
      or familial status.

     The Hate Crimes Statistics Act directs the Attorney General to collect statistics on crimes
      based on race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or ethnicity.

                    The Act contains no requirement that jurisdictions report hate crimes, nor
                     does it provide funding as an incentive to encourage reporting by state and
                     local jurisdictions. As a result, statistics collected pursuant to the Act are
                     incomplete.

                    In addition, the Act does not require the collection of gender-based hate
                     cnmes.

     The Sentencing Enhancement Act, passed as part of the 1994 crime bill, authorizes the
      imposition of enhanced sentences for federal crimes found to have been motivated by
      race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. The Act
      became effective in November 1995.
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
Hate Crimes Statistics

     Hate crimes statistics are maintained by the FBI, by some state and local law enforcement
      agencies, and by several private organizations. The number of hate crimes reported to law
      enforcement officials has increased over the past several years, but because of
      under-reporting and other factors it remains uncertain whether the total number of hate
      crimes committed in the United States is going up or down. In any event, the numbers are
      large.

            The FBI has released reports on hate crimes statistics, based on reporting from
             state and local agencies, each year since 1991. In 1991,2771 state and local
             agencies reported a total of 4,558 bias motivated incidents to the FBI. In 1995,
             95845 state and local agencies reported a total of 7947 such incidents to the FBI.
             The fact that many jurisdictions, including several large jurisdictions, r~ort to the
             FBI that they have no hate crimes leads many to conclude that the FBI's statistics
             present an incomplete picture of the national situation.

            Several private groups track hate crimes. Some track all types of hate crimes,
             while others focus their efforts on tracking hate ciimes against certain
                      constituencies, such as gays and lesbians, Jews, Arab-Americans, Muslim-
                     Americans, Asian-Americans, etc. Statistics kept by these groups tend to
             differ significantly from statistics kept by the FBI. First, some victims of hate
             crimes report their experiences to a group but not to the FBI. Second, several of
             the groups count incidents of verbal harassment as hate crimes even though such
             incidents do not constitute crimes in most states.

            . All of the reporting systems are plagued by under reporting, for which there are
               several reasons.

                    First, many of the most likely targets of hate crimes also are the least likely
                     to report incidents to the police. For example, 60% of the victims of
                     anti-gay incidents who reported their incidents to private groups did not
                     report the incidents to the police, in many cases because of a fear of
                     mistreatment or unwanted exposure. Similarly, many hate crimes victims
                     in immigrant communities do not report incidents to the police because
                     they fear reprisals or deportation.

                    Second, state and local jurisdiction often have disincentives to classify and
                     compile statistics relating to hate crimes. Tracking hate crimes may require
                     law enforcement agencies to perform additional investigative work to
                     determine the motivation behind crimes. In addition, some local political
                     leaders may believe that it would exacerbate racial tensions or harm their
                     jurisdictions' reputations to acknowledge that crimes committed in their
                     cities or towns were motivated by bias.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

 Q&A for Presidential Initiative to Improve the Safety ofImported Fruits and Vegetables
                                     October 10, 1997


Q:    What did the Administration propose with regard to food safety?

A:    I proposed legislative and executive actions that will further improve the safety of fresh
      fruits and vegetables, especially those imported into the U.S. The legislation will require
      the FDA to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, or other food from any foreign country
      whose food safety systems and standards are not on par with those of the U.S. I will
      back up this legislation by providing the necessary funds in my FY99 budget to enable
      FDA to expand dramatically its international food inspection force so that it can make
      good use of this new authority.

      In addition, I directed the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture to
      take additional steps to improve the safety of both imported and domestic fruits and
      vegetables. Specifically, I asked the Secretaries to issue within one year guidance on
      good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices for fruits and vegetables.
      By providing the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and vegetables, the
      guidance will improve the agricultural and manufacturing practices of all those, foreign
      and domestic, seeking to sell produce in the U.S. market.


Q:    Why is your Administration proposing these actions?

A:    There have been dramatic changes in the produce department of the grocery store. Thirty
      years ago, most produce sections only had around a dozen items year round, increasing to
      as many as 50 in the summer. Today, the chances are that there are 400 or more items in
      the produce section and they are there all year round. Last year, 38 percent of the fruit
      and 12 percent of the vegetables Americans ate were imported.

      We have changed as well. Americans are eating more fresh fruits and vegetables than
      ever before, and our nation's health experts tell us we will live longer, better quality lives
      as a result. Our environment is also changing. We are finding "new" exotic bugs such.
      as cyclospora and E. coli 0157:H7 on our food that once were not there.

      We must ensure that these changes do not increase the risk to American consumers of
      foodborne illnesses. Although raw produce -- including that imported from foreign
      countries -- is now safe, experts have suggested ways to make further improvements, and
      my actions accord with their recommendations.




                                                1
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
Q:   Are you saying that imported produce is unsafe?

A:   There is no data indicating that imported fruits and vegetables are more unsafe than
     domestic products. But some recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have been traced
     back to imports and it is important that foreign fruits and vegetables be held to the same
     safety standards as American products. The steps we are taking today are adding
     additional layers of protection. I am making sure that there are no gaps in our food
     safety system -- that high safety standards apply to imported as well as domestic food, and
     to fruits and vegetables as well as to meat, poultry, and seafood.


Q:   Will foreign countries have to comply with Good Agricultural and Manufacturing
     Practices if they want to export fruits and vegetables to the U.S.?

A:   We expect that exporting countries will develop similar practices that address potential
     food safety problems in their countries for one simple reason: they want to be able to sell
     food in our market, and they want that food to be safe.
                                                     .
     We do not know whether a country that does not comply with the new guidance will be
     able to import fruits and vegetables into the United states. The answer to this question
     depends on the exact content of the guidance, as well as on intricate legal determinations
     regarding equivalency between different countries' food safety systems. What is clear is
     that the FDA will have to cut off imports from countries that do not comply with existing
     legal standards applicable to domestic produce.

Q.   Doesn't this legislation impose trade barriers to food imports at a time when you are
     saying you want to lower them? Is this legislation consistent with free trade?

A.   This legislation is consistent with free trade and all our treaty obligations. We have no
     obligation to open our borders to imports that pose a greater risk than domestic products
     to American consumers. As long as we are not imposing any greater requirements on
     foreign countries -- as long as we are only holding them to our standards -- we are acting
     consistently with our trade policy.


Q:   Are these actions meant to provide political cover with respect to the food safety issue
     because it has become a part of the Fast Track trade debate?

A:   No. This is a part of my broad food safety agenda -- my longstanding commitment to
     ensuring that Americans' food supply is the safest in the world .. It does not relate to Fast
     Track.

Q:   ' What makes you think this new legislation can be effective? Do you seriously think you
       are going to be able to put FDA inspectors in every country abroad?

A:   My proposed legislation would give the FDA the same kind of responsibility that the
     USDA already has for meat and poultry. The USDA system has worked well to' ensure
     that countries with inferior safety standards can't import their meat and poultry. The
     FDA should be able to run a similarly effective system that inspects food safety systems
     and standards abroad and prevents imports from countries that do not provide the
     protections that the U.S. does.
