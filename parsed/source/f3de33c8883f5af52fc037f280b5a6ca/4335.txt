              President Clinton's Plan for Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation


        Today, President Clinton challenged Congress to pass sweeping tobacco legislation to
reduce teen smoking. The President announced that he will invite Congressional leaders in both
parties to the White House in the coming weeks to launch a bipartisan effort to enact federal
tobacco legislation. That legislation will build on the extraordinary efforts of the nation's
attorneys general, who helped create an historic opportunity for progress in reducing smoking,
especially by youth.

        In August 1996, the Clinton Administration announced a landmark rule by the Food and
Drug Administration to protect children from the harm caused by tobacco products, which was
upheld by a federal judge in North Carolina earlier this year. Those victories for the public
health, along with the aggressive efforts ofthe attorneys general, drove the tobacco companies to
the bargaining table and extracted concessions that would have been unimaginable just a short
time ago.

        Since a proposed national settlement was announced June 20, the Administration -- led by
Vice President Gore, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, and Domestic
Policy Advisor Bruce Reed -- has been working with the public health community, the attorneys
general, members of Congress, tobacco farmers, and others to develop a comprehensive tobacco
policy.

       Today, the President announced five key elements that must be at the heart of any
national tobacco legislation:

         1. A Comprehensive Plan to Reduce Teen Smoking, Including Tough Penalties If
Targets Are Not Met. Every day, 3,000 young people start smoking, and 1,000 of them will
die early as a result. The central goal of tobacco legislation must be a comprehensive, nationwide
effort to reduce teen smoking. The Administration is calling for:

             Tough Penalties and Price Increases to Reduce Teen Smoking: The
              Administration believes tobacco legislation must include stiff penalties that give
              the tobacco industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting kids.
              Legislation should set ambitious targets to cut teen smoking by 30% in 5 years,
              50% in 7 years, and 60% in 10 years, and impose financial penalties that hold
              tobacco companies accountable to meet those targets. The Administration
              supports penalties that are non-deductible, uncapped, and escalating -- so that the
              penalties get stiffer and the price goes up the more the industry misses the targets.
               Reducing youth smoking is the Administration's bottom line, and now it must be
              the industry's bottom line.

              One of the surest ways to reduce youth smoking is to increase the price of


                                                1
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
               cigarettes. By some estimates, a 10% increase in cigarette prices will lead to a
               7% drop in youth smoking. Today, the President called for a combination of
               industry payments and penalties that could increase the price of cigarettes by up to
               $1.50 a pack over the next decade if the youth smoking reduction targets are not
               met.

              A Public Education and Counter Advertising Campaign: To succeed in
               reducing youth smoking, legislation must provide for a nationwide effort to warn
               young people of its dangers, and to help parents discourage their children from
               taking up the habit. Legislation should provide for a public education and
               counter advertising carnpaign, as well as state and local prevention efforts. The
               Administration also supports stronger, more visible warning labels on tobacco
               products.

              Expanded Efforts to Prevent Youth Access to Tobacco Products: The current
               FDA rule includes significant measures to reduce youth access, such as requiring
               retailers to check photo identification of anyone under 27, banning vending
               machines and self-service displays from establishments accessible to children, and
               eliminating free samples and the sale of single cigarettes. The Administration
               supports legislation to build on those efforts by imposing even stronger
               restrictions on youth access and establishing an effective retail licensing scheme
               with tough penalties.


        2. Full Authority for FDA to Regulate Tobacco Products. In 1996, the
Administration took the historic step of asserting FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products. Since
that time, the Administration has supported federal legislation explicitly affirming the FDA's
authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. Under this
legislation, the FDA's authority over tobacco products must be as effective as its authority over
other drugs and devices. The legislation should not impose any obligation on the FDA to make
specific findings about such speculative matters as the creation of contraband markets, or impose
any special procedural hurdles or requirements, such as enhanced standards of proof or unusual
evidentiary formalities.


        3. Changes in the Way the Tobacco Industry Does Business. Federal tobacco
legislation must include measures to expose the industry's past misconduct, especially its efforts
to market products to children, and to change the way the industry does business.

               No Marketing to Children: Voluntary commitments by the industry -- such as
              . agreements to limit advertising to children -- can serve to recognize the need for
                increased corporate responsibility. Today, the President reiterated his call to the
                tobacco industry to stop marketing tobacco to children.


                                                 2
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

             Document Disclosure: To ensure that patterns of corporate malfeasance are
              disclosed and effectively checked in the future, tobacco legislation must provide
              for broad disclosure of industry documents, especially those containing scientific
              or other health information or relating to the industry's attempts to market tobacco
              to children. This legislation should respect essential principles of attorney-client
              privilege. But the legislation should establish effective mechanisms to turn over
              to the public all non-privileged documents (including documents the industry has
              falsely claimed to be privileged), as well as to disclose all scientific and
              health-related information in even privileged documents.

             Corporate Compliance: Legislation also must require tobacco companies to set
              up comprehensive corporate compliance programs that will reinforce the real
              economic incentives provided by the youth smoking penalties to discourage
              companies from marketing to children. Further, the legislation should establish
              oversight mechanisms to investigate and monitor corporate compliance and to
              make recommendations to Congress on appropriate future legislation.


        4. Progress Toward Other Public Health Goals. Federal tobacco legislation
provides an opportunity not only to reduce youth smoking, but to meet other public health goals:
the reduction of environmental (i.e., second-hand) tobacco smoke, the expansion of smoking
cessation programs, the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco, and the
provision of funds for medical research and other health objectives.

             Second-Hand Smoke: The best scientific studies show that restrictions on
              second-hand smoke reduce the risk of death and injury to non-smokers, including
              the hundreds of thousands of children with asthma and other respiratory illness,
              and lead many smokers to quit the habit. Federal tobacco legislation should
              include provisions to restrict smoking in workplaces and other public facilities of
              the kind found in H.R. 3434, as well as in the President's recent Executive Order
              on tobacco smoke in federal facilities.

             Smoking Cessation Programs: Data suggests that some 70% of smokers want
              to quit, but less than 25% now successfully do so. Legislation should provide
              sufficient funds to enable smoking cessation services to reach and assist the
              millions of smokers who want to break their addiction to tobacco products.

             International Leadership: According to the World Health Organization
              (WHO), tobacco use now causes 3 million deaths a year worldwide; unless
              checked, that number will rise to 10 million by 2025, with 75% of annual deaths
              occurring in developing countries. Legislation should strengthen the
              Administration's leadership role in global and bilateral efforts to reduce smoking


                                               3
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

               by providing assistance to international organizations such as the WHO.
              Resources for Medical Research and Other Health Care Objectives: The
               Administration believes that the primary objective oftobacco legislation is to
               reduce youth smoking, not to raise money. But tobacco legislation should take
               into account the health costs associated with smoking and the need for public
               health investments. Legislation should generate enough additional resources to
               establish a medical research fund and advance other important health objectives.
               In addition, Congress should repeal the provision giving the tobacco industry a
               $50 billion credit.


        5. Protection for Tobacco Farmers and Their Communities. The President made
clear today that any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their comniunities.
Most tobacco farmers live and work on small family farms; in many cases, their families have
been growing tobacco for generations. In some states, entire communities rely on income from
the tobacco crop. The Administration is committed to working with mem,bers of Congress in
both parties to ensure that we protect the financial well-being of tobacco farmers, their families,
and their communities.
