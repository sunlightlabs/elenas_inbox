                                     Q&As on Tobacco
                                      April 28, 1998

Q:   Do you really think you'll get a tobacco bill this year?

A:   I believe we have an historic opportunity to pass bipartisan legislation this year which
     contains all the elements necessary to reduce teen smoking. And I'm going to do
     everything I can to put politics aside and pass legislation that will achieve that objective.
     Senator McCain's legislation, which passed the Commerce Committee by a 19-1 vote, is
     a strong step in the right direction. It shows real momentum in both parties to pass
     effective, comprehensive tobacco legislation this year.

Q:   Isn't the McCain bill a big government, big tax proposal?

A:   No. What this bill does is to attack the problem of youth smoking comprehensively, as
     all experts say we need to do, by combining strong provisions on price, penalties,
     advertising and access, and FDA jurisdiction.' Although we have some differences with
     Senator McCain, he also recognizes the need to move forward on all these fronts to
     reduce youth smoking. That's not about big government. It's about sensible, bipartisan
     steps to dramatically reduce youth smoking.

Q.   But won't the McCain bill create 17 new federal bureaucracies?

A.   No -- this isn't about big government. What the bill does is to ensure that the federal
     government has the authority to regulate tobacco products in order to reduce youth
     smoking, as well as the ability to target tobacco revenues to strong public health and
     research efforts. The so-called "bureaucracies" that the industry is now complaining
     about are nothing more than what's necessary to protect the public health in this way -- to
     ensure that cigarettes are not sold to minors, to promote effective education, and to
     encourage smoking cessation. The proof that this is an industry con job is clear: almost
     all these provisions were in the June 1997 proposed settlement put forward by 41 state
     attorneys general, which the industry agreed to. The industry is criticizing these
     provisions now only because the political tide has turned against it, and certain other
     aspects of the legislation have gotten stronger.

Q:   Are you worried about the bill creating a black market?

A:   We think we can minimize black market activity through a system similar to the one
     that's been in place for alcoholic beverages for over sixty years by: 1) creating a "closed"
     distribution system for tobacco products so that only licensed entities can sell or buy
     products; 2) clearly branding packages for export, to prevent them from being diverted;
     and 3) establishing and enforcing penalties and other actions for violators. Senator
     ,McCain's bill largely addresses these issues, and we are working with him on technical
     changes.
Q:   Wouldn't this big government scheme extend the reach of the federal government to
                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
      every mom-and-pop grocery store or 7-11?

 A:   No. We are comfortable with a system that places primary responsibility for licensing
      retailers on state governments, as the McCain bill does. The important thing is to work
      with Congress to devise a scheme that will facilitate the effort to prevent smuggling,
      while not burdening retailers. The Administration will work with Congress, and the
      retailers themselves, on this issue.

 Q:   Won't the McCain bill bankrupt the companies? Lots ofWaU Street analysts say it
      will.

 A:   We don't want to put the tobacco companies out of business. We just want to put them
      out of the business of selling cigarettes to kids. A central feature of comprehensive
      tobacco legislation is to ensure that most of the payments made by the tobacco companies
      are passed on to price, in order to reduce youth smoking. As a result, there will be at
      most a modest impact on the profitability of the tobacco companies. This is also an
      industry with significant cash flow and net assets that will allow it to easily absorb this
      modest profit decline. The operating earnings of RJR, Philip Morris, and Loews last
      year were $18 billion. Even RJR, the most highly leveraged firm in this industry, had a
      $1.5 billion operating profit for its domestic tobacco business, and has over $4 billion in
      net assets from its Nabisco stock holdings. The only real risk of bankruptcy comes from
      losing a rash oflawsuits in court.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion      em

                                     Needle Exchange Q&As
                                         April 29, 1998


 Q:     What is your position on the Solomon Amendment to prohibit any Federal funding
        for needle exchange programs?

A:      The Administration strongly opposes this legislation because it is unnecessary and
        unwarranted. We believe that this legislation serves only to further politicize this issue.
        Congress should focus on those issues that immediately impact the health and well being
        of the nation: youth smoking, quality shortcomings, and Americans ages 55 to 65 that
        have been failed by the insurance market.


 Q:     If you believe that needle exchange is an issue that should be decided at the local
        level why does the Secretary need any authority to authorize Federal funding?

 A: '   It has been the longstanding position of Congress to give the Secretary of Health and
        Human Services the authority to determine the scientific and public health merits for a
        wide range of public health activities. We believe it is unwarranted and unnecessary to,
        take away the Secretary's authority and that this legislation is being pursued for purely
        political _. not policy·· reasons.


 Q:     If the science concludes that needle exchange programs reduce the transmission of
        HIV and do not increase drug use, why didn't you release federal funds for needle
        exchange programs?

 A:     We have always said that communities should make their own decisions on this issue,
        based on their own circumstances and using the best available scientific information.
        Releasing federal funding for needle exchange would have inappropriately shifted the
        focus away from communities -- where these decisions should be made -- to the national
        level. That could have severely undermined or threatened local programs that are
        currently in place, and hindered additional communities from deciding to put these
        programs into place. At the same time, such federal action could send an inappropriate
        message about the acceptability of drug use -- a message that is not sent when an
        individual community decides, on the basis of its unique circumstances, that a particular,
        carefully designed needle exchange program advances public health interests. For these
        reasons, the Administration concluded that it should simply give the scientific guidance
        that is necessary for communities to make their own decisions, rather than federalize the
        needle exchange issue.
