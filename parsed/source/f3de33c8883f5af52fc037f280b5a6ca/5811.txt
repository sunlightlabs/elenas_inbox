                                       Agenda Proposal #1
                               President's Advisory Board On Race
                                  Phoenix, January 13-14, ,1998

        Theme: Race in the Workplace

         The purpose of this meeting is to examine whether there is economic opportunity for all
         Americans. We will explore why, despite gains, significant disparities still exist between
         minorities and whites and the extent to which employment discrimination is due to race
        .or other factors. Further, we will examine whether there is a need for continued
         responses to address these issues and identify some promising practices to reduce
         disparities.

        Key Questions:

           Is there economic opportunity for all Americans and has this situation changed?

           Are there continuing. disparities in employment? What are the main causes of these
            disparities? Does discrimination continue to effect employment opportunities for
            minorities?

           What governmental and non-governmental programs and policies are most effective
            in addressing the causes oflabor market disparities? How much more needs to be
            done to reduce and eliminate disparities and how long should such programs
            continue?

        Day 1:
        lO:OOam - 1:OOpm
        The day begins with a meeting of corporate and labor leaders as well as other employee
        representatives with Labor Secretary Herman moderating the discussion. (This is one in
        a series of regional meetings.) The meeting will focus on means by which these entities
        will increase their involvement in promoting racial diversity in the workplace and
        supporting the Race Initiative.

        2:00 - 4:00pm
        Board members will next visit local, workplace Promising Practices.

        5:00 - 7:00pm
        There will be a meeting with regional leaders of American Indian tribes to hear their
        concerns.

        Day 2:
        The second day will begin the full Board meeting. The morning will focus on race and
        workplace issues among local Phoenix citizens. It will be followed by an afternoon
        session which will move from the local to the national perspective and address the causes
        of continued disparities, the methods to redress these problems, and the success or failure
        of these methods.

    9:30am-1 1:30am
    The first round table discussion will bring together local citizens to discuss the issue of
    whether economic opportunity is open to all Americans. The key exchange would be
    among those who say that there is economic opportunity in Phoenix for anyone who
    wants it (Arizona has the second highest growth rate in the U.S.) and those who can share
    stories about well-trained, experienced minorities who still can't get good jobs. It would
    include employee and management representatives from a large corporation and a small
    business, a representative from the Chamber of Commerce, and a representative from the
    Urban League.

    1:00 - 1:30pm
    Overview of the economic status of minorities

    1:30 - 3:30pm
    This round table would move from the local to the national perspective and begin by
    addressing the question of whether there is economic opportunity for all Americans. The
    round table will focus on the causes of continued disparities and possible programs and
    policies to address them. It could include a discussion of fears of "reverse
    discrimination" and whether programs designed to eliminate disparities should continue.
    (Possible panelists include: Leonard Valverde, ASU; Lorenda Sanchez, California
    Indian Manpower Coalition; Paul Ong, UCLA, Claudia Withers, Fair Employment
    Council of DC; Lawyers from Adarand case; Jerry Coangelo, corporate leader; William
    Julius Wilson, Harvard; Alejandro Portes, Princeton; Glen Loury, Boston University;
    Thomas Sowell, Stanford; Antonio Hernandez, MALDEF; Tony Carnevale)
