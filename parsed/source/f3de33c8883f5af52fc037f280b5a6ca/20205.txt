                                  REMARKS AT EQUAL PAY EVENT

                                DATE:            June 10, 1998
                                LOCATION:        Rose Garden
                            EVENT TIME:   2:30 pm - 3:30 pm
                                FROM:            Bruce Reed

                                                 Audrey Tayse-Haynes

      I.     PURPOSE

             To commemorate the 35th anniversary of President Kennedy's signing of the Equal Pay
             Act, to call on Congress to pass Senator Daschle's and Congresswoman DeLauro's equal
             pay bills, to announce a Council of Economic Advisors report on the gender wage gap,
             and to announce a Department of Labor report that provides a historical perspective on
             the wage gap.

      II.    BACKGROUND

             You will be making remarks to approximately 150 people, including equal pay and.
             civil rights advocates, labor leaders, business persons, legislators, and persons from
             Cabinet agencies. This is an opportunity to highlight women's progress since the
             signing of the Equal Pay Act and to call for legislative action on the remaining wage
             gap.

             The CEA report shows that a significant gap between the wages of women and men
             remains today although ithas narrowed substantially since the signing of the Equal Pay
             Act. In 1963, the year that the Equal Pay Act was signed, women earned 58 cents for
             every dollar men earned. Today women earn about 75 cents for every dollar men earn, a
             29 percent increase over the 1963 levels. Despite these gains, there continues to be a
             significant gap between men's and women's wages, even after accounting for factors such
             as educational attainment, work experience, and occupational choice.

              THE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR PASSAGE OF EQUAL PAY
                   LEGISLATION AND RELEASES COUNCIL
              OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS' REPORT ON THE WAGE GAP
                               June 10, 1998


Today the President will commemorate the thirty-fifth anniversary of President Kennedy's
signing of the Equal Pay Act and will urge passage of legislation to strengthen the laws that
prohibit wage discrimination against women. In addition, the President will release a Council of
Economic Advisers' (CEA) report on the gender wage gap, and announce a Department of Labor
report that provides a historical perspective of the wage gap. The President will be joined by Dr.
Dorothy Height, President Emeritus of the National Council of Negro Women, who was at the
signing ceremony of the Equal Pay Act in 1963.

Legislation to Improve Enforcement of Wage Discrimination Laws. The President will call
on Congress to pass legislation, introduced by Senator Daschle and Congresswoman DeLauro, to
strengthen laws prohibiting wage discrimination. The highiights of this legislation include:

      Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The legislation adds full compensatory
       and punitive damages as remedies, in addition to the liquidated damages and back pay
       awards currently available under the EPA. This proposal would put gender-based wage
       discrimination on equal footing with wage discrimination based on race or ethnicity, for
       which uncapped compensatory and punitive damages are already available.

      Non-retaliation provision. The bill would prohibit employers from punishing employees
       for sharing salary information with their co-workers. Currently, employers are free to
       take action against employees who share wage information. Without the ability to learn
       about wage disparities, it is difficult for women to evaluate whether there is wage
       discrimination.

 .    Training, Research, and Pay Equity Award. The Daschle-DeLauro bill provides for
       increased training for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission employees on matters
       involving the discrimination of wages; research on discrimination in the payment of
       wages; and the establishment of the "The National Award for Pay Equity in the
       Workplace," which will recognize and promote the achievements of employers that
       have made strides to eliminate pay disparities,

CEA Report on the Wage Gap. The President will announce a report by the CEA that shows
that a significant gap between the wages of women and men remains today although it has
narrowed substantially since the signing of the Equal Pay Act.

      Gender Pay Gap Has Closed. In 1963, the year that the Equal Pay Act was signed,
       women earned 58 cents for every dollar men earned. Today women earn about 75 cents
       for every dollar men earn, a 29 percent increase over the 1963 levels.
                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
          But Discrimination Still Exists. Despite these gains, there continues to be evidence of
           labor market discrimination and a significant gap between men's and women's wages,
           even after accounting for factors such as educational attainment, work experience, and
           occupational choice.

    Department of Labor Report Provides a Historical Perspective on the Wage Gap. The
    President also will announce a Department of Labor report that provides a thirty-five year
    perspective on the wage gap. This report focuses on three periods since the signing of the Equal
    Pay Act -- 1960-1975, 1975-1985, and 1985-1997 -- and highlights the increased participation of
    women in the labor force, the changing occupations of women, and the emergence of more
    women-owned businesses.

          Women's Labor Force Participation Has Increased. Women's labor force participation
           rate rose from 37.7 percent in 1960 to almost 75 percent in 1997.

          Increased Contributions by Women to Family Income. Between 1995 and 1996 alone,
           the number of families with two working parents increased by nearly half a million,
           making equal pay even more of a family issue. In these years, both parents were
           employed in 63.9 percent of married-couple families with children 18 and younger, while
           28.2 percent of these families had an employed father and homemaker mother.
