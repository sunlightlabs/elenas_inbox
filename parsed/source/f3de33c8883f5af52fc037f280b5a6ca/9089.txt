In Boston, today President Clinton will make announcements to support law enforcement and help make
our schools safer. He will announce: (1) the release by the Departments ofJustice and Education of an
Early Warning Guide for teachers and principals to help identifY and respond to violence in schools; (2)
the availability of $30 million for states to provide college scholarships to aspiring law enforcement
officers in return for a commitment of service; and (3) $80 million for more than 1,000 communities to
hire and retain police officers.

Helping Schools Prevent and Respond to Violence

       Giving teachers and principals needed tools. In response to the tragic loss of life and injuries at
        Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, in his June 13 radio address, President Clinton
        directed the Secretary of Education and the Attorney General to develop a guide to help teachers,
        principals, and parents respond to the early warning signs of troubled youth that can lead to school
        violence. This week, over 200,000 copies of the guide will be sent to every school and posted on
        the Justice and Education Department Websites. The guide gives school communities information
        on how to:

                (I) Identify the early warning signs that relate to violence and other behaviors, including a
                list of specific signs to look for in troubled youth, such as: uncontrolled anger; patterns of
                impulsive and chronic hitting, intimidating, and bullying; detailed and specific threats to
                use violence; gang affiliations; feelings of persecution; and past history of violent and
                aggressive behaviors such as cruelty to animals or fire setting.

                (2) Take action steps to prevent violence, intervene and get help for troubled children. and
                respond to school violence when it is imminent or has occurred. The guide instructs
                schools how to develop a violence prevention and response plan and form a school-based
                team to oversee the plan's implementation. It provides a crisis procedure checklist, a
                step-by-step plan to follow once sudden violence occurs. The guide also lists actions
                students can take -- such as listening to troubled friends, involving trusted adults, and
                asking law enforcement to conduct school safety audits -- to help create safer schools.

Advancing the Education and Training o(New Community Police Officers

       Police Corps: scholarships for service. The President will announce the availability of $30 million
        for 23 states to encourage young people to become law enforcement officers through college
        scholarships. The Police Corps provides educational assistance of up to $7,500 per year for four
        years for students who agree to serve on a state or local police force for an equal length of time.
        Police Corps also provides policing agencies $10,000 per participant for each year of required
        servIce.

       Expanding Police Corps to 23 states. Six new states will participate in Police Corps and will
        receive $14.3 million to award scholarships for 330 students -- bringing the total number of
        students participating in Police Corps to over 1,000. The remaining funds will support the
        ongoing expenses of Police Corps participants already approved to date. In alI, 23 states will
        participate in Police Corps: AR, CO, CN, FL, GA, IN, IL, KY, MA, MD, MI, MS, MO, NV, NM,
        NC, OH, OR, OK, SC, TX, UT, W A and the Virgin Islands.

           Working to Put 100,000 Police to Our Streets

                 Helping to hire new officers across the country. President Clinton will announce over $66 million
                  in grants to hire 905 full-time and 66 part-time officers to 237 law enforcement agencies under his
                  COPS Program. Among the departments receiving grants are: Jonesboro, AR for 15 officers,
                  including 12 school safety officers; Orange County, FL for 81 officers; Lawrence, MA for 20
                  officers; and Suffolk County, NM for 50 officers. Today's announcement brings the total number
                  of officers funded through the COPS program to over 78,000 -- on time and ahead of schedule to
                  adding 100,000 community police officers to our streets.

                 New assistance for small communities to retain officers. In addition, $14 million will be awarded
                  to 855 small communities (with populations ofless than 50,000) to help absorb the long-term costs
                  of retaining new COPS-funded officers. The Small Community Grant Program will provide
                  one-time grants to help small jurisdictions pay for part of the fourth-year salary of existing officers
                  that currently receive three years of federal COPS funds.
