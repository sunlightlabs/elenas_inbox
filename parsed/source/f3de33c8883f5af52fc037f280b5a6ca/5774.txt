                President's Advisory Board On Race
                      Phoenix, January 13-14, 1998

The meeting on Race in     the Workplace will focus on three key questions:
         How much diversity is there in employment in America and how much has it changed?

         Are there continuing disparities in employment? What are the main causes of these disparities?
         Does discrimination continue to effect employment opportunities for minorities?

         What governmental and non-governmental programs and policies are most effective in
         addressing the causes oflabor market disparities? How much more needs to be done to reduce
         and eliminate disparities and how long should such programs continue?

Day 1:

         ·      10:00am - 1:00: The day begins with a meeting of regional corporate leaders, labor
                union representatives, and employees with Labor Secretary Herman moderating the
                discussion. The meeting will focus on means by which these entities will increase their
                involvement in promoting racial diversity in the workplace;

         ·      2:00 - 4:00p.m: Board members will next visit several local Promising Practices;

         ·      5:00 - 7:00pm: There will be a meeting with regional leaders of American Indian tribes
                to hear their concerns.

Day 2: There will be in-depth discussions of the facts and concerns about employment discrimination
and disparities followed by an afternoon discussion of methods to redress these problems including a
forum discussing the merits of affirmative action and other tools.

         ·      9:30am-II :30am: The flrst round table discussion will focus of continuing racial
                disparities and discrimination in labor markets. This would include a discussion of in
                employment discrimination making use of the testimony of testers and some current
                cases.

         ·      1:30 - 3:30pm: The second round table would focus on potentially useful policies to
                promote employment diversity including affIrmative action. This would include a
                discussion of whites fears about the employment advancement of minorities; the
                "perception of loss" and an assessment of "reverse discrimination."

         ·      5:00 - 7:00pm: The day will conclude with a community forum in which Board
                members learn of the race concerns in the Phoenix area.

                                  Phoenix, January 13-14, 1998

Theme: Race in the Workplace -- despite gains, significant disparities still exist between
minorities and whites, and there is still clear evidence of employment discrimination. There is,
therefore, a need for carefully-designed responses to address these issues, and we know of a
number of promising practices.

 Day 1
 The primary purpose ofthe first day is to acquaint Board members with local businesses which
 exhibit promising practices.

 lOam - 4pm, ongoing throughout day
 Board members arrive and visit different promising practice sites around the area, especially
 business sites.

 5pm-7pm
 Evening forum with tribal leaders (open to the public)-- this forum is part of the outreach that
 will take place with each board meeting to hear concerns and issues from local people.

  Day 2
  Instead ofgoing from a local to a national perspective as we did in Fairfax, we could go from a
. national perspective and then conclude with local leaders (in the corporate forum) signing on to
  playa leadership role in their communities to address many ofthe issues raised in the morning
  session.

 9:30am - 9:45am
 Statistical overview (Janet Yellen?) showing progress of minorities but continued existence of
 disparities.

 9:45am - 11 :45am
 Engaging roundtable discussion on key economic opportunity issues, from a national perspective.
  Experts address key questions, including: why do disparities persist and what can we do about
 them? Should affirmative action programs continue? Is there reverse discrimination and what
 can be done about it?

 Ipm-3pm                                                                                        ,
 CorporatelEmployee Forum -- Secretary Herman would host this group of regional corporate and
 labor leaders as well as non-union employees. They would discuss what they learned from the
 morning session and how they might address the issues raised. The objective is to enlist their
 support to play leadership roles in supporting the President's Initiative on Race.

 5pm -7pm
 Community forum for the Board to hear race concerns oflocal community. Open to public.

    January 13th and 14th
    Phoenix, Arizona

    Statement of why we are in Phoenix. Local politician?? Address the negative history and the
    future potential of this very high growth state.




    AM
    What:         Outreach meeting
    Who:          Corporate; labor; employee
    Why:          Discuss concerns/questions/input re: race and diversity in the workplace

    PM
    What:         Native American outreach
    Who:          Tribal leaders
    Why:          To familiarize the Board with issues in Indian country, with a focus on
                  employment and eduational concerns.



    Both panels would be moderated with Q&A following the second panel. I'm not sure that either
    should have a Phoenix focus, given that all indications are that there is not much to focus on re:
    this issue.

    AM
    What:         Panel 1: Is there equal opportunity in employment?
    Who:          Someone who says yes; someone who says no; someone who says depends.
                  Could include folks from EEOC and OFCCP who could discuss recent cases,
                  have charts and graphs, etc. (wage gap; income issues; glass ceiling)
    Why:          To discuss the issue of whether discrimination continues to be a problem.

    PM
    What:         Panel 2: Is affirmative action the answer?
    Who:          Someone who says yes; someone who says no; someone who says depends.
                  This panel of labor market experts (economists?) could address questions of
                  White backlash; controlling employer preferences that may be racially motivated;
                  need to overcome old boy network, etc.
    Why:          To discuss solutions employed to overcome discrirnnation, and whether they help
                  or hurt racial reconciliation and equal opportunity.
