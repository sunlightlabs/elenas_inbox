Re:            Welfare-to-Work Options for the Federal Government


Following are four steps the Federal government can take to hire welfare recipients.

       Create a New Federal Government Hiring Avenue Specifically for Welfare Recipients

       Make Work Pay For Welfare Recipients Who Choose Employment With the Federal
        Government

       Expand Federal Government Information Services, Including the Internet

       Require Agency Performance Goals and Offer Agencies Hiring Incentives

An Executive Order and two legislative proposals are needed to fully implement the program.
Also needed would be $300 million in new expenditures, primarily for child care, expanded
technology services, and bonuses. If fully enacted, the proposal would accomplish the following.

I.      Create a New Federal Government Hiring Avenue for Welfare Recipients

Through Executive Order, the President can create a new, excepted service hiring authority for
welfare recipients. The program would be designed to encourage agencies to hire welfare
recipients initially as temporary employees. At the end of two years and only upon successful
performance, these employees could be converted to regular, competitive government
employment. Currently, there exists five similar programs targeted to specific groups: The
Veteran's Readjustment Appointment program; The Severely Handicapped Appointment; The
Student Career Experience Program; The Worker-Trainee Program; and The Presidential
Management Intern Program.

These programs are advantageous to Federal agencies because they allow simplified hiring
processes and targeted recruitment from smaller pools of people.

The New Excepted Service Hiring Authority For Welfare Recipients would:

       Create an excepted appointment with a two-year limit followed by the agency option to
        convert the employee to competitive service;

       Prevent limitations on appointment grade level;

       Encourage conversion to career status after two years of satisfactory performance;

       Suggest agency provided job-specific training and/or education after initial hiring;
                                                                    Heit..f:>wnp Wi\~
      Enact a peer counselor or mentor program for those hired under this status;

      Convert employee status after 2 years to one of three options:

       --Convert employee to competitive Federal Government status
       --Allow the two-year appointment to expire; separate the employee
       --Extend the appointment by one year with OPM approval

II.    Make Work Pay for Those Welfare Recipients Who Choose Employment in the
       Federal Government

Once welfare recipients enter the labor market, they face harsh economic realities that often force
them back on the welfare rolls. Many welfare recipients find that the package of welfare
benefits received was worth more than the job they've just taken. To ensure that work pays
more than welfare and.to help welfare recipients remain in the labor market once employed, child
care, transportation, and health care subsidies are helpful. Following are suggestions for making
these subsidies available to welfare recipients hired by the Federal Government.

      Subsidize child care on a sliding-fee scale based on income. DoD currently subsidize
       child care centers as well as child care payments based on income, as allowed under the
       Military Child Care Act of 1989. Under the DoD program, all employees receive a
       subsidy, but that subsidy varies by income, the minimum subsidy being 35 percent of the
       cost. Last year's appropriation to DoD for this program was $252 million. DoD's
       program offers a model other agencies might follow to offer child care subsidies to their
       low-income employees. The Federal government might consider extending subsidized
       child care to low-income employees at non-DoD agencies. Such subsidies could be
       offered on a sliding fee scale and would be based on income. Legislation and new
       appropriations are required to offer such a program.

      Direct agencies to use the existing Federal Fare Subsidy Program to offer graduated
       transportation subsidies based on income to welfare recipients hired by the Federal
       government. Currently, through the Fare Subsidy Program, the Federal government offers
       agencies the option to subsidize the cost of public transportation for its employees in
       areas where state and local programs exist. The subsidy goes directly into the employees
       paycheck. However, because the cost of offering transportation subsidies to all employees
       is prohibitive, few agencies have pursued this option. Current law would allow agencies
       to offer transportation subsidies on a graduated scale based on income to target the
       subsidy to those who need it most. The President could direct agencies to pursue that
       option. Fare subsidies would come directly out of the participating agency's
       appropriations.

      Publicize that workers hired under the new hiring authority for welfare recipients would
       be eligible to participate in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program.
       While all welfare recipients are eligible for one year of transitional Medicaid, employees
       hired under exceptive service hiring authority are also eligible for FEHB.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
       Encourage eligible employees to access the Earned-Income Tax Credit (Ene) monthly
        through their paychecks. Under current law, those eligible for the EITC are allowed to
        receive it either as an income tax refund or in equal distributions throughout the year. A
        Presidential Directive could require Federal agencies to inform all eligible
        employees of both their eligibility and of the payment options.

III.    Use and Expand the Federal Government Information Services to Publicize
        Federal Job Opportunities, the New Excepted Hiring Option, and Other Related
        Information

Both social service providers and welfare recipients need access to information about job
openings, placement firms, training programs, and the like. Currently, the Federal government
has several vehicles to disseminate information, including the Federal Register, a Federal Jobs
Database, and new Internet-based information systems. However, information dissemination
regarding Federal job opportunities needs to be expanded. Following are expansion options.

The World Wide Web and the Internet

A recent NOAI APWA survey found that there are approximately 133,000 computers in welfare
offices around the country. Of those, 51,000 are 486s and above (therefore have the capacity to
access the Internet), 6,000 are 386s or less (making access to the Internet feasible but difficult),
and 76,000 are non-intelligent computers (computers operating off a main frame only with no
separate intelligence, making Internet access impossible). This means that about 113 of the
nation's caseworkers have access to the Internet. Therefore, Internet employment information is
a quick, easy and good option for 1/3 of the welfare offices. For the remaining 2/3 of the
welfare offices, computer systems could be updated or new systems purchased at a cost to the
government of approximately $35 million over two years including maintenance and training.
Computers with Internet access could be up and running by the end of the first year. Through the
Internet, the Federal government would:

       Deliver career counseling through USACareers, a new, interactive computer-based
        internet web site currently under development by OPM's Employment Service. The site
        should be up by March 1997 and will analyze skills and abilities and develop training
        plans for welfare recipients to get the skills and aptitudes necessary for Federal
        employment.

       Initiate a publicity campaign on USAJOBS, OPM's employment'information Homepage
        to inform both welfare recipients and state, local, and nonprofit social service agencies of
        available jobs and avenues to those jobs including training for welfare caseworkers and
        recipients on.

       Implement Hiring Outlook, an electronic information system designed to provide
        information on Federal occupations including appointment types, permanent and
        temporary employment opportunities, and needed skills. This service is currently
        scheduled to be on line by September 1997.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
Direct Mail

      Continue and expand posting of state, local, and municipal government jobs and solicit
       support and help from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the League of Cities, the National
       Association of Counties, and the National Governors Association.

      Initiate a monthly direct mailing campaign to state welfare offices, Chambers of
       Commerce, Private Industry Councils, and similar organizations on Federal job
       opportu톘ities.

IV.    Set Performance Goals and Offer Federal Agencies Incentives For Hiring
       Welfare Recipients

To ensure that this Federal hiring program is successful, performance goals should be in place as
well as incentives to encourage the agencies to meet those goals. While the new hiring authority
is an incentive in and of itself because it allows simplified hiring processes and targeted
recruitment from smaller pools of people, there are other incentives to consider.

      Encourage Federal agencies to set hiring goals based on a percentage of their overall
       workforce and require them to self-monitor.

      Require Cabinet Secretaries to report their monthly hiring progress to the White House.

      Offer current employees a "finders fee" for any welfare recipient that person successfully
       brings into the agency. OPM currently has similar performance-based employee bonus
       programs and believes a finders fee program fits within existing guidelines. Upon
       direction from the President, agencies could move forward with it. Finders fees (and
       other employee bonuses) come directly out of the rewarding agency's
       appropriations.

      Draft legislation to allow Federal agencies to access the work subsidy option under the
       new welfare law. Use the Treasury, Postal Appropriations bill to amend Federal
       appropriations laws to accept wage subsidy funds and credit them to the appropriations
       account of the participating agency to pay the subsidized employees wage as long as the
       funds were less than or equal to the wage. ~: We are currently exploring labor laws
       that might affect this option.)

      Offer Presidential recognition to Federal agencies that make the greatest strives to hire
       people off welfare.

      Give preference to those competing for government contracts who have hired welfare
       recipients. We are currently examining Federal grant and contract procedures to
       determine if this is feasible. Similar programs exist now: HUD construction contractors
       are currently required, to the extent possible, to hire low-incorne individuals to work on
       the construction projects and Government contracts are also given preferentially to
       minority-owned businesses.
