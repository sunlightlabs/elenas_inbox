                Clinton Administration: Taking Action to Stop Gun Violence
                                       May 27,1999


This morning, the Vice President and Congressional Democrats challenged the Republican
leadership in the House to follow the Senate's lead and quickly pass common sense gun
legislation that would help keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. And later this
afternoon, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Treasury Undersecretary Jim Johnson will
call on the House Judiciary Committee to improve upon -- not weaken -- the Senate's legislation
by passing some of the other gun measures proposed by the President last month. One week
after the Senate's historic vote to close the gun show loophole, the Administration's clear and
consistent message to Congress is:

      The time to act is now. Although violent and gun-related crime have fallen
       dramatically over the last six years, the recent school shootings remind us that we must
       do even more to reduce youth violence and keep guns out of the hands of children.
       Sadly, an estimated 13 young people die everyday in America from a gun shot wound --
       or the equivalent of365 "Littletons" a year. This is unacceptable. The House
       leadership must recognize that there is a growing national consensus that government
       should more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children, and that they should
       put the will of the American people over the clout of the gun lobby.

      The House should lead, not follow. Although the Senate passed tough new provisions
       to close the gun show loophole, require child safety locks with every new handgun sold,
       ban the importation oflarge capacity ammunition clips, and prohibit violent juveniles
       from owning guns as adults, it did not debate and vote on other important gun proposals
       put forwarded by the President. The House has an important opportunity -- indeed, an
       obligation -- to show leadership and ensure that its members have a chance to debate and
       vote on additional life-saving measures, such as:

              Raising the age of handgun possession from 18 to 21. In 1994, the House
              voted unanimously to ban the possession of handguns by juveniles under the age
              of 18. Given that law enforcement officials recover more crime guns from 18
              and 19-year olds than any other age group -- well over 80 percent of which are
              handguns -- Congress should now consider raising the age of handgun possession
              from 18 to 21.

              Extending the Brady Law to purchases of explosives. In 1993, Congress
              passed the Brady Law requiring background checks of prospective gun purchases,
              and an end to the buying and selling of guns on the "honor system." To date,
              Brady background have helped stopped more than 250,000 illegal handgun sales
              to felons, fugitives, and other prohibited purchasers. The time has now come for
              Congress to apply the same common sense provisions to the sale of explosives,
              and cut off the easy access that criminals and children have to them.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


           Holding reckless adults accountable. Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws
           promote gun safety and responsibility by holding adults responsible if they allow
           children easy access to firearms and ammunition. CAP laws promote the safe
           and secure storage of firearms, and recent studies show that in states where they
           have been enacted fatal unintentional shootings have been reduced by an average
           of23%. Congress should pass a tough, federal CAP law that includes felony
           penalties and stiff fines for adults who "knowingly or recklessly" allow a child
           access to a gun that is later used to kill or cause injury.

   No new loopholes. Even as the Senate voted to try and close the gun show loophole, the
    gun lobby exercised its influence and worked behind the scenes to include dangerous new
    loopholes that would have made it easier for criminals to get guns and harder for law
    enforcement to catch those criminals. At one point, the Senate bill included at least 5
    new loopholes to our gun laws, including one to weaken the successful Brady Law by
    limiting background checks to no more than 24 hours -- even if law enforcement needed
    more time on a Sunday to clarify someone's criminal history while the county courthouse
    was closed. The Administration will expose and fight against the gun lobby's stealth
    efforts to weaken our gun laws with new loopholes.

   A record of accomplishment. Under the President's leadership, this Administration has
    launched one of the most cooperative and successful efforts to keep guns out of the hands
    of criminals, and to crack down on gun criminals and traffickers that fuel gun crime.
    Successful Administration efforts include:

           Blocking over a quarter of a million illegal gun sales. Through Brady
           background checks, we have helped stop over 250,000 handgun sales to felons,
           fugitives, stalkers, and other prohibited purchasers.

           Sending more serious gun criminals to prison. Because we work more closely
           than ever before with our counterparts in state and local law enforcement, the
           overall number of criminals sent to federal and state prisons for weapons offenses
           is up by nearly 25 percent since 1992. The number of serious gun criminals sent
           to federal prison for at least 5 years is also up, by nearly 30 percent since 1992.

           Providing more resources for gun enforcement. Over the past 2 years, we
           have called for tens of millions of dollars to hire over 280 new ATF agents and
           over 40 new federal prosecutors to vigorously enforce our guns laws. And
           during the past 6 years, we have increased state and local assistance for law
           enforcement by over 500 percent --from $849 million to more than $5 billion.

           Reducing gun crime. With more police on the street and tougher gun laws on
           the books, crime rates have dropped across the board for 7 years. Overall violent
           and property crime are down by more than 20 percent each, and the murder rate is
           down to its lowest level in 30 years. Also, homicides, robberies, and aggravated
           assaults committed with gun are down by an average of 27 percent.
