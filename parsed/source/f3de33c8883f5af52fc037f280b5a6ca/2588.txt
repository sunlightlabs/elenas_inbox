Q:Recently the Washington Post reported that the number of black students admitted to UCLA
law school had dropped by 80%, the lowest number offered admission since the early 1970's.
UC Berkeley admitted just 14 black students out of a class of 792, down from 75 in 1996. And
at the University of Texas, the Post reported, nearly 400 fewer blacks and Hispanics have been
offered undergraduate admission, a 20% drop in one year. Meanwhile, white and Asian
admissions are up in both states. In both states the sharp declines in minority admissions are
attributed to roll-backs of Affirmative Action--in California, by the UC Board of Regents, and in
Texas by the 5th Circuit's Hopwood decision.

Are you concerned about these reports of declining enrollments of minority students in
postsecondary education?

A: These declines are disturbing and completely unacceptable. Educational opportunity is the
touchstone of the American dream, yet figures like this raise a serious danger that minority
students will perceive that the doors of college education are being closed to them. Moreover, as
I said in my Affirmative Action speech at the National Archives, diversity in education helps
prepare all our students to be productive citizens in the 21 st century, so these developments
should concern every American.

Q: What is your administration doing to address this problem?

A: The Administration is addressing this issue on several fronts:

      We are committed to continuing to intervene in litigation in support of appropriate
       affirmative action programs. The Department of Education is looking for an appropriate
       opportunity to challenge the Hopwood decision, and the Department of Justice has filed a
       brief on behalf of plaintiffs in the challenge to California's Proposition 209.

      The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education is conducting a review of the
       Texas higher education system to ensure that Texas has eliminated all remnants of its
       former de jure segregated system.

      The Department of Education is providing substantial leadership and research support on
       Affirmative Action. Secretary Riley and other leaders at the Education have written to
       college officials and sought opportunities to speak on diversity in the university setting
       and to offer assistance in promoting it. In addition, Education has also called on colleges
       and universities to develop more creative, race-neutral approaches to achieving diversity,
       such as more aggressive recruitment in secondary schools with high percentages of
       minority students and forming educational partnerships with such schools.

      Finally, through my 10-point Call to Action for American Education we are pursuing
       strategies (such as America Reads and our technology initiatives) to raise standards and
       improve educational opportunities available to all K-12 students, to prepare them for

                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
student willing to work for it, and to make sure students know that they can afford to
attend. Central to this effort, our balanced budget agreement calls for the largest Pell
grant increase (to $3,000) in over twenty years. We also remain firmly committed to
strong college work study and TRIO programs.
