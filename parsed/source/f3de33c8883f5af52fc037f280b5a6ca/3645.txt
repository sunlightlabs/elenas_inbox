MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report




       1. Welfare Reform: New Report on LEAP Teen Parent Program -- This week the MDRC
released updated findings on Ohio's LEAP program for teen parents. The results are somewhat
better than the findings from the recent New Chance study, but are still discouraging. LEAP
showed modest success in increasing school attendance and employment and reducing AFDC
receipt. (By contrast, the teen mothers in New Chance were not more likely to hold jobs or
leave welfare.) But LEAP did not increase high school graduation and had very little impad on
teens who had already dropped out of school before entering the program.

        LEAP's approach differs from New Chance's in a number of ways.. LEAP is a
mandatory program that cuts the welfare benefits of teen parents who don't attend school and
                                                                  a
gives bonuses to those who do. By contrast, New Chance was voluntary program which
provided extensive services to participants through community-based programs. LEAP served
both in-school and out-of-school youth, and most of its success was concentrated among
participants who were enrolled in school at the time of random assignment. New Chance
served only teen parents who had already dropped out of school. These findings led MDRC
President Judy Gueron to say "In general, we don't have examples of success working with teen
parents who have dropped out."                             .

       2. Welfare Reform: Proposed High Performance Bonus -- The welfare law provides $1
billion for bonuses for high performing states. The provision was one offered by Senator
Lieberman and supported by the DLC. The law requires HHS to work with NGA and APWA
on a proposed formula. Last week, HHS distributed to states a preliminary concept paper,
based on discussions to date. While no one has yet agreed to proposal, we are encouraged that
the measurements of performance focus on the important issues: employment; job retention;
earnings; and teen births. One contentious issue involves which data should be used to measure
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

 employment and wages: states want to use their welfare agency records, while HHS wants them
 to rely on the more objective state unemployment insurance data which employers report. All in
 all, this bonus will enable us to collect data to hold states publicly accountable for their
 performance on what really matters.

 [Elena -- you asked for two other items, see below. I need to do more research to answer these
 questions. I will do so today if I have time; otherwise, I'm afraid we'll have to answer in next
 week's weekly.]

        3. Welfare Reform: CEA sAnalysis of Child Only Cases -- You asked whether we should fix
 the problem described by CEA, that states with a higher proportion of child only cases will have
 a harder time meeting the work rates and have more families reaching the time limit [Check to
 see whether changing this was considered in the technicals bill.]

          4. Welfare Reform: Child Support Computer Systems -- As you know, the General
  Accounting Office released a report last week criticizing states for not completing their child
  support computer systems. A requirement in the 1988 Family Support Act required states to
. develop these systems by October 1995; Congress later extended the deadline until October 1997.
   HHS estimates that nine states won't meet the deadline. [Investigate: What do we think we can
  do to fix this problem.]

         5. Crime: Juvenile Crime -- On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out
 the juvenile crime bill by a vote of 12-6. Senators Feinstein and Torricelli voted in favor of the
 legislation. While parts of the bill are good, it still fails to contain some of our key priorities:
 guaranteed funding for after school programs, more funding for prosecutors and court-based
 programs (e.g., Boston's Operation Night Light), and the gun ban for violent juveniles. A vote
 on our child safety lock provision was defeated on a 9-8 vote.

         Some improvements were made to the bill during markup, including the separation of
 juveniles and adults incarcerated in the federal system, allowing the bill's prosecutor funding to
 be used for programs like Operation Night Light (but without increased funding), and some
 guaranteed prevention funding. In addition, Hatch agreed to work with Kohl to authorize our
 after schools program/anti-truancy initiative which was successfully included in the
 appropriations bill. The juvenile crime legislation is not expected go to the Senate floor until
 October.

         6. Crime: Brady Law - On Thursday, July 24th, the Arkansas Attorney General issued
 a statement making clear that Arkansas did have the proper authority under state law to continue
 doing Brady background checks. Thus, Ohio is now the only state that has given to the NRA's
 pressure/legal argument that they do not have the authority to continue doing Brady background
 checks. Justice and Treasury officials are still working with the Ohio Attorney General's office
 to reverse this post-Brady decision policy.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


       7. Drugs: Household Survey - Preliminary findings from HHS' 1996 Household Survey
on drug abuse are in, and the results are mixed. They include:

      Overall drug use remains flat. There are 1~ million current users or 6.1 % of the
       population. Most are marijuana users -- 10.1 million persons or 4.7% ofthe population.
      Increases among some youth seems to have stopped. The jump in marijuana use by
       youth aged 12 - 17 that has occurred since 1992 dropped slightly in 1996. However,
       marijuana use by youth aged 18 - 25 has increased slightly.
      Heroin use up. Not only is heroin use increased since last year -- particularly for youth
       ages 25 and under -- but there are a record number of new heroin users (141,000).
 .    Cocaine use showing signs of coming back. Past month users of cocaine are up
       slightly for the first time since 1992 -- and up 27% since the 1994 low point in cocaine
       use. Also, HHS estimates that the rate for first-time cocaine users in the 12 - 17 age
       group is one of the highest ever.

NB: The Household Survey measures drug use in America's households (age groups 12 - 17, 18
- 25, and 25 and up), not the entire population. The survey misses youth below the age of 12,
military personnel, homeless persons, and those in prisons and jails. Thus, the survey tends to
miss some of the hard-core drug users.

        8. Drugs: Crack Study - Justice's National Institute of Justice is set to release an
analysis of Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) data from 1987 to 1996 that shows crack use down in
24 cities. The report finds that crack use by arrestees is down substantially -- and at least by
10% -- in 10 major cities; that, in another 7 cities, crack use is down among juveniles, which
suggests that declines in the overall rate are forthcoming; that, in 5 cities, the crack epidemic was
as strong as ever; and that no crack epidemic exists in 2 of the cities.
