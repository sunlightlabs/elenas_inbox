                                               A MAINSTREAM TAX CUT

On December 15, 1994, President Clinton proposed the Middle Class Bill ofRights, which included a
$500 Child Tax Credit, an expanded IRA to allow people to withdraw money tax-free and without penalty
for education, and a tax deduction for post-high school education expenses. Each of the President's
proposals is included in this budget:

A CHILD TAX CREDIT FOR APPROXIMATELY 27 MILLION FAMILIES.

   $500 Per-Child Tax Credit for approximately 27 million families with 45 million children
   under 17. The credit begins to phase out for couples with incomes above $110,000.
    13 million children from families with incomes below $30,000 will receive the child tax credit
   -- up to 7.5 million* more than would have under the Congressional plans. Families earning.
   under $30,000 such as young teachers, police officers, farmers, and nurses who work hard and play
   by the rules will now receive the Child Tax Credit. ·Comparison to House passed bill; vs. Senate bill: 5.9 million.
A VICTORY FOR MIDDLE CLASS PARENTS TRYING TO PAY FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S
COLLEGE AND FOR WORKING PEOPLE TRYING TO UPGRADE THEIR SKILLS.

           $1,500 HOPE Scholarship to make the first two years of college universally available.
           The final agreement includes the President's initiative to help make the 13th and 14th grades as
           universal as a high school diploma is today. Students will receive a scholarship of 100% on the
           first $1,000 of tuition and fees and 50% on the second $1,000.
           20% Tuition Tax Credit for college juniors, seniors, graduate students and for working
           Americans pursuing lifelong learning to upgrade their skills. The 20% credit will be
           applied to the first $5,000 of qualified education expenses through 2002, and to the first
           $10,000 thereafter. The President has long understood that the economy is changing and that
           people need the opportunity to enhance their skills throughout their working lives. This is why
           the President insisted on the 20% tuition tax credit that is in the final bill and was a major
           improvement over the bills passed by Congress.

TAX INCENTIVES TO REVITALIZE OUR NATION'S DISTRESSED URBAN AREAS.
  areas of our nation's cities. This budget reflects the President's agenda:

          A New Tax Cut Plan Helps to Clean Up and Redevelop Brownfields. The 3-year
          Brownfields tax incentive will reduce the cost of cleaning up thousands of contaminated,
          abandoned sites in economically distressed areas by permitting clean-up costs to be deducted
          immediately for tax purposes. This will, in tum, encourage redevelopment of these areas.
          The Treasury Department estimates that this $1.5 billion tax incentive would leverage more than
          $6 bIllion fOr pn"vate sector cleanups nationwide, allowing redevelopment of14,000
          brownfields.

          New Empowerment Zones (EZs). The budget includes a second-round ofEZs -- 15 urban
          and 5 rural EZs. The new EZs will benefit from a different blend of tax credits from the
          first-round communities. For example, the EZs will be eligible for the Brownfields tax
          incentive, special expensing of business assets, and qualification for private-activity bonds.

HELPING MOVE PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

          A Welfare to Work Tax Credit. This provision will give employers an added incentive to
          hire long-term welfare recipients by providing a credit equal to 35% of the first $10,000 in
          wages in the first year of employment, and 50% of the first $10,000 in the second year, paid to
          new hires who have received welfare for an extended period. The credit is for two years per
          worker to encourage not only hiring but retention.

          $3 Billion to Help Move 1 Million People from Welfare to Work. Includes President's
          proposal to create $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge to move long-term welfare
          recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs. These funds can be used for job creation, job
          placement and job retention efforts, including wage subsidies to private employers, and other
          critical post-employment support services. The Labor Department will provide oversight but
          the dollars will be placed in the hands of the localities who are on the front lines of the welfare
          reform effort.

               PRESIDENT CLINTON DELIVERS
   THE LARGEST SINGLE INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH
        CARE SINCE THE PASSAGE OF MEDICAID IN 1965

The President fought hard to ensure that the Budget Agreement includes $24 billion to provide
meaningful health care coverage to as many as five million of our nation's ten million uninsured children.
 This investment includes a meaningful benefits package, ensures that states use this money to cover
. cost-sharing protections for families.

        INVESTS UNPRECEDENTED $24 BILLION FOR UNINSURED CHILDREN. The
        President insisted on increasing the investment for children's health from $16 billion to $24
        billion by including revenue from a new tobacco tax. Because of the President's leadership, this
        budget will contain the largest children's health care budget increase since the enactment of
        Medicaid in 1965. Including these additional revenues in the children's health initiative will not
        only further reduce the number of uninsured children, but it will also serve as a financial barrier to
        help prevent our children from starting smoking in the first place.

        ENSURES MEANINGFUL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, WHILE ALLOWING
        STATES TO DESIGN THEIR OWN BENEFITS PACKAGES. The President fought hard
        to ensure that this investment guarantees the full range of benefits -- from checkups to surgery --
        that children need to grow up strong and healthy. The President also worked to ensure that
        prescription drugs, vision, hearing, and mental health coverage now offered at the state level are
        extended to millions of uninsured children.

        GIVES STATES THE FLEXIBILITY TO DESIGN BENEFITS THAT MEET THEIR
        NEEDS. States will be able to choose from any offour benefits packages: (1) the FEHPB
        model; (2) the benefits package of the most popular state HMO; (3) the state employee plan; and
        (4) the actuarial equivalent of any of the three stated benefit plans as long as prescription drugs,
        vision, hearing, and mental health services now offered in these plans are guaranteed to equal at
        least 75 percent of the value of these services.

        SUPPLEMENTS, NOT SUPPLANTS, CURRENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.
        Includes provisions to ensure that states provide health care coverage to children who do not
        currently have health insurance. It requires that states maintain their current Medicaid eligibility
        levels of spending to access Federal dollars to ensure that this investment is not used to replace
        public or private money that already covers children.

        ENSURES ADEQUATE COST-SHARING PROTECTIONS. The President fought to
        ensure that families are not forced to shoulder excessive costs for their children. The Agreement
        guarantees that families under 150 percent of poverty will be protected against overly burdensome
        cost sharing.

    PRESIDENT CLINTON DELIVERS A $500 CHILD TAX CREDIT
          FOR APPROXIMATELY 27 MILLION FAMILIES

MAIN FEATURES OF THE CHILD TAX CREDIT:

        ·      Age_ Covers children under 17.

        ·      Amount per child.      $400 in 1998. $500 thereafter.

        ·      Income limits. Begins to be phased out for couples making over $110,000 and for one
               parent families making over $75,000.

        ·      "Stacking. " Child tax credit will be calculated or "stacked" before the EITC, and will
               therefore be available for the up to 7.5 million children in working families who have
               incomes below $30,000 and who were denied the child tax credit under the congressional
               bills.

        ·      For families with more than two children - Refundability to cover out-of-pocket
               income and payroll taxes. Because many large families have little income tax liability,
               but pay significant out-of-pocket payroll taxes, the child tax credit for these families is
               partially refundable. These families will receive a child credit for their income taxes plus
               the extent to which their out-of-pocket (employee share) payroll taxes exceed their EITC.

        ·      Savings Incentive. Taxpayers will be given the opportunity to contribute $500 each year
               to an education Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Earnings would accumulate
               tax-free in the account, and no taxes will be due upon withdrawal for an approved purpose.

A CHILD TAX CREDIT FOR FAMILIES WHO WORK HARD AND PAY TAXES.

13 million children from families with incomes below $30,000 will receive the child tax credit
-- up to 7.5 million* more than would have under the Congressional plans. Families making under
$30,000 like young teachers, police officers, farmers, nurses and others who work hard and play by the
rules will now receive the Child Tax Credit. ·Comparison to House passed bill; vs. Senate bill: 5.9 million.

President Clinton worked to ensure that under any final agreement, these young parents would
receive a child tax credit to make it easier for them to raise their children.

         Consider a family offour with two small children: the father is a rookie police officer making
         $23,000, and the mother has chosen to stay at home. Both congressional bills would have
        denied this family, and millions ofothers, the child tax credit. Under the final agreement, this
        family will receive a child tax credit of$675.

        PRESIDENT CLINTON DELIVERS EDUCATION TAX CUTS
         TO HELP MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES PAY FOR COLLEGE

THE PRESIDENT'S HOPE SCHOLARSHIP AND TUITION TAX CREDIT
From the beginning, promoting expanded educational opportunity has been the centerpiece of President
Clinton's budget and his middle class tax cut proposal. Promoting education is the centerpiece of this
final tax cut bill:

        $1,500 HOPE Scholarship to make the first two years of college universally available. The
        final agreement includes the President's program to advance the goal of making the 13th and 14th
        grades as universally available as a high school diploma is today. Students will receive a
        scholarship of 100% on the first $1,000 of tuition and fees and 50% on the second $1,000.

       20% Tuition Tax Credit for College Juniors, Seniors, Graduate Students and working
       Americans pursuing lifelong learning to upgrade their skills. The 20% credit will be
       applied to the first $5,000 of tuition and fees through 2002, and to the first $10,000 thereafter ..
       The President has long understood that the economy is changing and that people must have the
       opportunity to enhance their skills throughout their working lives. This is why the President
       insisted on the 20% tuition tax credit that is in the final bill and is a major improvement over the
       Congressionally-passed bills.

A SUMMARY OF ADDITIONAL EDUCATION TAX CUTS
·      Education and Retirement Savings Accounts. Allows penalty-free IRA withdrawals for
       undergraduate, post-secondary vocational, and graduate education expenses. Additionally, taxpayers
       are given the opportunity to deposit $500 into an education IRA. Earnings would accumulate tax-free
       and no taxes will be due upon withdrawal for an approved purpose.

·      Employer-Provided Education Benefits. Extends Section 127 of the tax code for three years, which
       allows workers to exclude $5,250 of employer-provided undergraduate education benefits from their
       taxable income.

·      Student Loan Interest Deduction. Allows a deduction for up to $2,500 per year of interest on
       education loans for expenses of students enrolled at an institution of higher education. This deduction
       will be available even if the taxpayer does not itemize deductions.

·      Community Service Loan Forgiveness. In most circumstances, a loan that is forgiven is considered
       income and is therefore taxable. To encourage programs that offer loan forgiveness to borrowers who
       take lower-paying, community-service jobs, the agreement excludes from taxable income both loan
       amounts forgiven through programs run by nonprofit tax-exempt charitable or educational institutions.
        Currently, the exclusion generally covers only certairi forgiveness arrangements between students and
       government entities.

·      Repeal Cap on Tax Exempt Bond Issuance by Colleges and Universities. Repeals the $150 million
       bond cap that affects private higher education institutions and certain other charitable institutions.
       The repeal applies to tax-exempt bonds issued by these institutions to finance new capital
       expenditures.

            PRESIDENT CLINTON DELIVERS A BUDGET THAT
              STRENGTHENS AND PRESERVES MEDICARE

The Budget Agreement preserves and strengthens the Medicare program, saving $115 billion over five
years and extending the life of the Medicare Trust Fund for at least ten years. It modernizes Medicare by
including new market-oriented reforms that have proved successful in the private sector plus $4 billion in
new preventive benefits. As this agreement strengthens and preserves the Medicare program, it also
creates a Medicare Commission to examine the long-term needs of the program so that Medicare will be
prepared for the retirement of the baby boomers.

           SAVES APPROXIMATELY $115 BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS_ Includes about
           $115 billion in savings over five years and between $400-$450 billion over ten years.

           EXTENDS THE LIFE OF THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND FOR AT LEAST TEN
           YEARS_ This agreement will keep Medicare solvent until at least 2007.

           IMPLEMENTS NEW MARKET-ORIENTED REFORMS INCLUDING:

           (1)   Empowering the Secretary of Health and Human Services to implement competitive
                 market mechanisms;
           (2)   Opening up new options that offer more choice among competing health plans and
                 have proven effective in the private sector, including Preferred Provider
                 Organizations (PPOs) and Provider Sponsored Organizations (PSOs);
           (3)   Providing Americans with meaningful choices by reforming annual Medigap
                 enrollment; and
           (4)   Building on Medicare's success in controlling hospital costs, restructuring the
                 payment systems for home health, agencies, skilled nursing facilities and hospital
                 outpatient departments so that rates are set in advance through a prospective payment
                 system.

           INCLUDES $4 BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS FOR NEW PREVENTIVE
           BENEFITS. Expanding coverage for mammograms and colorectal screening and
           improving self-management of diseases like diabetes.

           ENSURES NEW PREMIUM PROTECTIONS FOR LOW-INCOME MEDICARE
           BENEFICIARIES. The budget agreement invests $1.5 billion over five years to pay the
           premiums for beneficiaries up to 135 percent of poverty. Beneficiaries over l35 percent of
           poverty to as high as 175 percent of poverty will get assistance as well.

           TAKES STEPS TO ENSURE THAT VULNERABLE HOSPITALS ARE
           PROTECTED. The Agreement reduces the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospitals
           cut from $2.4 billion in the Senate-passed bill to $600 million over five years.

           ESTABLISHES A MEDICARE COMMISSION. The agreement creates a 17-member
           Medicare Commission which contains eight Democrats and eight Republicans and a Chair
           who will be selected jointly by the President and the Congressional leadership. The
           Commission will release a report in 1999 and require an 11 of 17 majority to ensure that its
           recommendations are bipartisan.

        THE BUDGET AGREEMENT PROTECTED THE PRESIDENT'S
            PRIORITY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING EDUCATION,
               ENVIRONMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

The Budget Agreement achieved 99% of the President's budget for non-defense discretionary spending
over the next 5 years. While priority items are protected, there are $61 billion of savings in
non-defense discretionary outlays over the next 5 years -- a 10% real cut by 2002. These priorities
will be ratified in the appropriations process under the budget agreement.

LARGEST INCREASE IN EDUCATION INVESTMENT IN 30 YEARS

The budget agreement endorsed President Clinton's overall plan for investing in education and training
-- $63 billion more than the Republican plan over five years. With the tax cuts for education, this
represents the largest increase in the Federal investment in education in 30 years. The agreement
specifically calls for:

        Increases funding for Head Start to continue on road to achieve enrollment of 1 million
        kids in 2002.

       Largest Pell Grant increase in two decades - boosts the maximum 1998 Pell grant from
       $2,700 to $3,000, and expands the program to more poor independent students.

       Adopts the President's budget request to launch a child literacy initiative consistent with
       his America Reads program.

        Increases funding for bilingual (27% increase) and immigrant education (50% increase).

       Includes all of the $579 million .increase in funding requested by the President in his FY
       1998 budget of $5.3 billion for Training and Employment Services, including Job Corps.

BOLSTERS ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT AND KEY PROGRAMS

       Provides a 9% increase for EPA's Operating program which includes research,
       enforcement, state grants and regulatory programs.

       Doubles the pace of Superfund cleanups, if policy details can be worked out.

       Provides a 6 percent increase for operation of the National Parks, and a more than
       doubles funding ($156 million) for Everglades Restoration.

PUTS MORE POLICE ON THE STREET

       Protects funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) initiative, which
       should put 100,000 more police officers on the street by 2000.

URBAN INITIATIVES

       Expansion of Community Development Financial Institution Fund.

  PRESIDENT CLINTON DELIVERS TAX CUTS
TO CLEAN UP AND REVITALIZE URBAN AREAS ...

THE BROWNFIELDS TAX INCENTIVE WILL REDUCE THE COST OF
CLEANING UP THOUSANDS OF CONTAMINATED, ABANDONED SITES IN
ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED AREAS by pennitting clean-up costs to be deducted
immediately for tax purposes. This will, in tum, encourage redevelopment of these areas.
The tax incentive will be available for three years. The Treasury Department estimates that
this $1.5 billion tax incentive would leverage more than $6 billion for private sector cleanups
nationwide, allowing redevelopment of14,000 brownfields.

THIS PROPOSAL IS A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR MANY OF AMERICA'S MAYORS.
 Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, writing recently on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
urged Ways and Means Chainnan Archer to include the President's Brownfields proposal in
the tax bill: "This is a high priority for communities across the nation." [Letter to Chrnn. Archer,
6/11197]

CREATES NEW EMPOWERMENT ZONES. Under the President's 1993 Empowennent
Zones and Enterprise Communities initiative, participating communities develop a strategic
plan to spur economic development, and they receive Federal tax benefits, social service
grants and flexibility in use of Federal funds in order to put these plans into effect. The EZs
and ECs are urban or rural areas with high poverty and unemployment rates.
·          A Strong Start since 1994. The 105 communities selected as EZIECs in 1994 amassed
           over $8 billion in public-private commitments. In the six urban Empowerment Zones, the
           private sector has made or pledged $2 billion in new investments.
·          A Second Round to Build on Successes. In response, the President proposed, and
           the bill includes, a second round ofEZs -- 15 urban and 5 rural EZs. The new EZs
           will benefit from a different blend of tax credits from first-round EZs. They will
           be eligible for the Brownfields tax incentive, special expensing of business assets,
           and qualification for private-activity bonds .


  ...AND TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

A WELFARE-TO-WORK TAX CREDIT. This provision will give employers an added
incentive to hire long-tenn welfare recipients by providing a credit equal to 35% of the first
$10,000 in wages in the first year of employment, and 50% of the first $10,000 in wages in the
second year, paid to new hires who have received welfare for an extended period. The credit
is for two years per worker to encourage not only hiring, but also retention.

$3 BILLION TO HELP MOVE 1 MILLION PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK.
Includes President's proposal to create $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge to move
long-tenn welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs. These funds can be used for job
creation, job placement and job retention efforts, including wage subsidies to private
employers, transportation and other critical post-employment support services. The Labor
Department will provide oversight but the dollars will be placed in the hands of the localities
who are on the front lines of the welfare refonn effort.

PRESERVES THE MINIMUM WAGE AND OTHER LABOR PROTECTIONS FOR
WELFARE RECIPIENTS MOVING FROM WELFARE TO WORK. Does not
include the House-passed provision to leave workfare participants unprotected by the Fair
Labor Standards Act and other employment laws.
                 WELFARE ROLLS, and establishes a strong process for workers to raise grievances with an

                 Immigrants in the country as of August 22, 1996 but not receiving benefits at that time who

        AN mSTORIC BALANCED BUDGET: BUILDING ON THE PRESIDENT'S
            STRONG RECORD OF DEFICIT REDUCTION AND GROWTH

President Clinton has achieved a balanced budget agreement that includes critical investments in education,
health care, and the environment while strengthening and modernizing Medicare and Medicaid -- just as he
promised last year. This achievement finishes the job of balancing the budget, a key priority for the President
since he took office.

ONLY FOUR YEARS AGO. In 1993, the President inherited a budget deficit of $290 billion that was
expected to explode to over one-half trillion dollars in 2002. A decade of large deficits had weakened the
foundation of our economy and sapped our power and prestige abroad. Unemployment was 7.5% in 1992,
and job growth was sluggish.

THE PRESIDENT PASSES HIS 1993 ECONOMIC PLAN. President Clinton addressed this problem of
fiscal instability immediately on a pledge to cut the deficit in half. Working with Democrats in Congress, he
implemented an economic program designed to reduce the deficit and to invest in critical priorities, such as
education and training. The 1993 economic plan has exceeded all expectations: the deficit has fallen by
more than 75%, dropping for a likely fifth year in a row to $67 billion or lower in 1997; equipment investment
has been the strongest since Kennedy was President; the economy has produced over 12.5 million new jobs;
and the unemployment rate this year is the lowest in 24 years.

THE PRESIDENT ACHIEVES BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT TO FINISH THE JOB. The President
began his second term determined to fulfill his goal of balancing the budget. As we head into the next
century, this bipartisan agreement protects our priorities, solidifies the nation's economic foundation, restores
faith in our ability to govern ourselves, and bolsters America's preeminent position in the world economy.
The balanced budget agreement includes roughly $900 billion in 10 year net deficit savings and delivers the
first balanced budget in a generation.

    BUDGET STAYS IN BALANCE. In addition to delivering a balanced budget in 2002, the budget
             agreement delivers budget surpluses for each of the second five years of the budget
             window, 2003-2007, putting the nation on a solid fiscal path at a critical time as the baby
             boom generation edges toward retirement.

How Typical American Families Will Benefit

Example #1
Consider a family offour with an income of $40,000 a year. The father is a carpenter who makes
$25,000, and the mother works at a local department store and makes $15,000. They have two children,
a son who is 14 and a freshman in high school and a daughter enrolled full-time in her first year at a state
university. Her tuition is $5,000 a year.

This family benefits from the tax cut in at least two ways. They will receive a child tax credit of $500 for
their son, plus a HOPE Scholarship of $1 ,500 for their daughter. In total, they will receive a $2,000 tax
cut.


                                                     Tax Cut

    aged 14 and 18 and $40,000 income:

    Child Tax Credit for 14 year old                        $500
    HOPE Scholarship for 18 year old                        $1,500

                Total tax cut:                         $2,000

    *   Tax Year 1999

Example #2
Consider a family of three making $55,000 a year. The father has a degree in accounting and works for a
local business in the accounting department. The mother works part~time at the local library. They
have one daughter aged 7. The father would like to return to school to prepare for his CPA examination.
He is going to attend the local liberal arts college. He has signed up for two courses with total tuition of
$4,000.

This family will receive a $500 child tax credit for their daughter and an $800 tuition tax credit to help pay
for the father's course work.

Example #3
Consider a family of three making $80,000 combined. They have a daughter who is 17 years old and is
trying to decide where to go to college. She is leaning towards a private liberal arts school. Her parents
are staring at tuition payments in excess of $1 0,000 a year for four school years and wondering how they
will pay for it.


This tax cut will help. Their daughter will be eligible for a $1,500 HOPE Scholarship in each of her first
two years in college. During her junior and senior years, she will be eligible for a tuition tax credit of
$1,000. (because four school years fall across five tax years she will be eligible for another $1,000 in the
fifth year).

A single mother lives with her six year old daughter in California. She's been working as a bank teller for
several years and her pay is now $20,000 a year. Working towards becoming a loan officer, she is taking
one course a semester towards a bachelor's degree. Her tuition is $1,000. This family will receive a
$500 child tax credit for the daughter and a $200 tuition tax credit.

President Clinton has achieved a landmark balanced budget that promotes our values, providing critical
investments for education, health care, and the environment while strengthening and modernizing Medicare
and Medicaid. It also provides middle-class families a tax cut to help raise their children and send them to
college.

·      Largest Increase in Higher Education Funding Since the G.I. Bill of 1945, including $1,500
       HOPE Scholarship to make the first two years of college universally available and a 20% Tuition Tax
       Credit for college juniors, seniors, graduate students and working Americans pursuing lifelong
       learning to upgrade their skills.

·      Single Largest Investment in Health Care for Children Since the Passage of Medicaid in 1965.
       Today, ten million children have no health insurance. The balanced budget takes dramatic
       and concrete steps to right this wrong. Health care coverage will be extended to up to 5
       million children

·      Critical Long-Term Entitlement Reforms including between $400-$450 billion in ten-year
       Medicare savings to keep the Medicare Trust Fund Solvent for at least a decade. Importantly, these
       savings are achieved in a way that prepares Medicare for the 21 st century -- more choice, competition
       and revamped payment systems and preventive benefits.

·      $500 Per Child Tax Credit to make it easier for approximately 27 million families to raise their
       children.

       Helping Move 1 Million People from Welfare to Work. The budget bill provides an
       additional $3 billion, the full amount requested by the President, to help communities
       move long-term welfare recipients into jobs. The dollars are locally controlled and
       targeted to high-poverty areas.

       Protects our Nation's Most Vulnerable People. The budget includes $12 billion to
       restore both disability and health benefits to legal immigrants who are currently
       receiving benefits or become disabled in the future, ensuring that they will not be
       turned out of their homes or otherwise left to an uncertain fate. The budget bill will
