      Subj ect:         Re: Is there a budget rollout planning meeting today?

      My apologies. Rahm's office has been sending out the emails for me, and
      was working off of an incomplete list.  It is at 5:30 in the Roosevelt Room
         Gene and Rahm will chair. The draft agenda is attached, and, as you
      can see, DPC is obviously involved in several ways.

      Welfare:     Since last Friday, much of the outreach and press has been
      conducted    by Kevin Thurm at HHS.  Bruce was originally slated to make a
      number of    calls, but was out of town. Nonetheless, DPC should be a major
      player in    this effort.

      Education:     Cohen is working closely with the rest of the Education team.

      Health Care:     Jennings and Bianchi are part of the health care     team,
      obviously.

      I have also attached a copy of the rollout strategy that we have worked
      off of since Friday, in case you do not already have a copy.  I gave
      copies on Friday to Elana, Jennings, and Weinstein.

      Thanks,

      Kaplan

The purpose of this document is to spell out our budget rollout strategy and the key tasks that
must be completed in the hours and days following the completion of a budget agreement. A
detailed action plan containing a more precise set of activities will follow.

                                    STRATEGIC GOALS

               Show How We Won. Stress how the deal meets the President's priorities: a
               balanced budget that protects education, environment, Medicare, Medicaid and
               helps move people from welfare to work.

               Establish Deal's Credibility. Obtain bipartisan validation for the agreement

               Conduct Any Damage Control. Reach out to traditional Democratic and
               progressive constituencies, such as labor, seniors, and minority groups; bring .
               Congressional Democrats into the fold
