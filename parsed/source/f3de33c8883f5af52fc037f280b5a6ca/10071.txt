Background

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Hurricane Mitch
Recently, in light of the catastrophic disaster that resulted from Hurricane Mitch, Rep. Gutierrez
has written asking that the President grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Hondurans,
Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans currently residing in the U.S. A grant of TPS
would prevent nationals of these countries from being deported to their home countries and
would provide work authorization for all nationals of these countries currently residing in the
U.S. Though we have not yet reached an Administration position on the granting ofTPS, today
the Department of Justice is issuing a statement extending the temporary stay of deportation of
these nationals to their home countries, at least through the Christmas holiday season (sometime
in early January). We -- DPC and NSC, along with the Department of Justice and the State
Department -- are considering whether it would be appropriate to grant TPS to one or more of
these countries and what other kinds of relief we may be able to offer.

Talking Points

      As the President announced during his radio address last Saturday, we intend to extend
       our stay of deportation through the Christmas holidays for citizens of the affected
       countries living in the United States, while examining on an urgent basis
       recommendations for further relief, consistent with the recommendation Mrs. Gore made
       after her trip to the region.

                                    November 16, 1998
Background

The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), enacted during the
last session of Congress, authorized the more lenient (pre-1996 Act) rules for suspension of
deportation -- a means of obtaining pennanent legal status -- to apply to pending cases of
Guatemalans and Salvadorans, while providing amnesty (automatic "green cards") for
Nicaraguans and Cubans. The Hispanic Caucus and many Central American advocates have
urged the Administration to implement NACARA in a way that would achieve "parity" among
all Central American groups affected by the legislation. Congressman Gutierrez has also urged
that we seek legislative relief for certain Hondurans, who were completely excluded from
NACARA. Congressmen Gutierrez and Becerra have strongly supported amnesty for
Salvadorans and Guatemalans (equivalent to that received by the Nicaraguans and Cubans) and
the additional class of Hondurans.

Until quite recently, we took the position that Hondurans are not similarly situated to the Central
American groups covered by NACARA, and thus had opposed special relief for this group.
However, on October 29, 1998, the President sent a letter to Rep. Gutierrez that stated that, upon
further study, we have concluded that there is a small class of Hondurans who are similarly
situated to the Salvadorans and Guatemalans covered by NACARA, and that this group is
entitled to the same relief provided to these other groups. At the end of the last session of
Congress, we attempted to attach a provision to the Omnibus appropriations legislation that
would have given NACARA-like benefits to Hondurans who applied for asylum in the U.S. prior
to December 31, 1992. We were not successful in this effort. However, we continue to favor
some kind oflegislative solution that would achieve "parity" for this narrow class of Hondurans.

Talking Points

      The Administration shares your concern about the disparities in treatment in NACARA.
       As the President indicated in his signing statement, we are seeking to minimize these
       disparities in the implementation process.

       In this regard, the Attorney General has authorized a new administrative procedure for
       adjudicating the cases of Salvadorans and Guatemalans covered by NACARA. This
       modified procedure will be less adversarial than immigration court and will thus lessen
       the need for representation by an attorney.                   .

      Also, as noted in the President's October 29, 1998 letter to you, the Administration is
       seeking legislative relief for the class of Hondurans that are similarly situated to the
       Salvadorans and Guatemalans covered by NACARA -- namely, those Hondurans who
       applied for asylum prior to December 1992.

      The President is generally supportive of efforts to achieve parity among similarly situated
       groups, but would have to review any proposed legislation carefully before deciding
                                                                Automated Records Management System
