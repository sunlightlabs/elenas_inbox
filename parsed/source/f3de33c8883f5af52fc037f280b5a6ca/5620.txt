MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                      BRUCE REED
                           GENE SPERLING
                           CHRIS JENNINGS

SUBJECT:                   Health Insurance Coverage Initiatives

        Throughout your Administration, you have worked to enact legislation to expand access
to affordable health insurance. The Balanced Budget Act included an unprecedented $24 billion
investment for state-based children's health insurance programs. This historic initiative will
clearly reduce the number of uninsured. However, there are other deserving populations whom
we could target in our step-by-step reforms. These include the pre-65 year olds (referenced in
the Medicare memo), workers between jobs, and workers in small businesses. In addition, we
are working on possible proposals to expand Medicaid coverage topeople with AIDS and
disabilities through pilot programs. The policy development of these proposals is still
underway, so we have not included them here.        .

        Taken together, these initiatives total around $10 billion over 5 years. This amount is
less than half of the health investments enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act and less than
4 percent of the premium assistance proposed in the Health Security Act. Having said this, none
of your advisors believe the Medicare and Medicaid savings left after last year's deficit reduction
effort are sufficient to fund these initiatives. There may be $0.5 to 1 billion over 5 years in
Medicaid savings, but those savings will be difficult to achieve and there may be other claims on
them (e.g., child care, benefits to immigrants). Another possible source of funds is the tobacco
settlement, given the natural link between tobacco and health care.

         Your advisors uniformly agree that we need to take all actions possible to achieve if not
exceed your goal of increasing insurance coverage for 5 million children. A series of proposals
are described in this memo to help accomplish that goal. There is less agreement on whether we
should address a new group of uninsured people in this budget. The Department of Labor
strongly supports the workers-between-jobs demonstration; of all health initiatives in the budget,
it is their highest priority. OMB also supports that demonstration if sufficient furlds are
available. HHS believes that this proposal has merit, but is skeptical that it will attract any more
support than it has in the past three years.

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
A.     CHILDREN'S HEALTH OUTREACH

        The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides funds for coverage of
millions of working families' uninsured children, a population that previously had trouble
affording coverage. It also builds upon the Medicaid program, which covers nearly 20 million
children. But important work remains to be done. In particular, we need to work with states to
enroll the millions of uninsured children in these programs.
                                                                                              o
        Medicaid eligible children are especially at risk of remaining uninsured. Over three
million uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid. Educating families about their options and
enrolling them in Medicaid has always been a problem, but it has recently become even more
challenging. The number of children covered by Medicaid leveled off in 1995 and, according to
the Census, dropped by 6 percent in 1996. While some of this decline may be due to the lower
number of children in poverty, another part may result from families' misunderstanding of their
children's continued eligibility for Medicaid in the wake of welfare reform.

Options to Increase Outreach for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program

       To address the need for children's health outreach, we propose a series of policy options.
Together, these initiatives could cost $1 to 2 billion over five years (or more depending on policy
choices about the enhanced match). Preliminary discussions with NGA and some children's
advocates suggest they strongly support these efforts. In addition, the Administration is
developing partnerships to encourage a complementary range of private outreach activities.

        Enhanced match for outreach. One option for improving state outreach is to provide
an enhanced match to enroll children who are eligible for but not previously enrolled in
Medicaid. At the end of each year, if a state can document that it has increased its enrollment
over its baseline, it would receive an increased matching amount per newly covered child
(possibly through administrative payments). This policy rewards states only if they succeed in
outreach, rather than matching activities that mayor may not work. Depending on the amount
of the incentive and the administrative design, this option could cost to $0.5 to 1 billion over five
years.

        Moving outreach to schools and child care sites. We could build upon the
"presumptive eligibility" provision in the Balanced Budget Act to make it easier to enroll
children in Medicaid and CHIP. The BBA option allows limited sites (M., hospitals) to give
low-income children temporary Medicaid coverage on the spot while they are formally enrolled
in CHIP or Medicaid. This proposal would broaden these sites to include schools, appropriate
child care sites, and Head Start sites, at the state's option. HCFA actuaries preliminarily
estimate that this proposal would cost $400 million over 5 years. Also, under the BBA, states
that use presumptive eligibility must pay for its costs out of the CHIP allotment, reducing the
amount available for other coverage. States have advised us that this requirement discourages
them from taking advantage of the presumptive eligibility provision. HCFA actuaries

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
preliminarily estimate that dropping this requirement would cost $25 million over 5 years.
        Accessing 90 percent matching funds for outreach. A third way to increase funding
for children's health outreach is to increase states' flexibility in using a special Medicaid fund set
aside in T ANF for outreach for children losing welfare. This $500 million fund is currently
allocated to states with a 90 percent matching rate for outreach activities to certain children. We
could expand its use to all children, not just welfare children. HCFA actuaries preliminarily
estimate that this policy would cost $100 million over 5 years. NGA supports this change.

        Simplifying enrollment.· A simple, accessible emollrrient process could encourage
more families to emoll their children in Medicaid or CHIP. To help create such a process, we
propose several actions, all of which are inexpensive. First, we could streamline the application
process by simplifying Medicaid eligibility and by encouraging the use of simple, mail-in
applications. HCFA has already developed a model single application form for both Medicaid
and CHIP. We could condition some of the financial incentives described above on using a
single or simple application. Second, we are reviewing the feasibility and cost of a nationwide
1-800 number that will link families with their state or local offices. Such a number could be
placed in public service announcements, on the bottom of school lunch program applications,
and on children's goods like diaper packages.

Discussion

        There is unanimous support across agencies for focusing on children's health outreach.
HHS and Treasury believe that such outreach should be the Administration's first priority.
NECIDPC and OMB believe that aggressive outreach will be needed to meet or exceed the
Administration's goal of covering 5 million uninsured children. Although OMB is supportive, it
points out that because some children may be impossible to reach and some states may not use
these options, we are unlikely to emoll all 3 million children. NEC, also supportive, raises the
concern that spending on an outreach initiative may be a communications challenge so soon after
the enactment of the $24 billion base children's health program. However, policy experts,
Govemors, and children's advocates alike will endorse this initiative.

         One great challenge is the difficulty of finding savings from Medicaid to offset the costs
of this initiative. With this in mind, your advisors are considering the tobacco settlement as a
financing source. Specifically, we are exploring the advisability of allowing states to retain the
Federal share of the tobacco funds if they dedicate those funds to high-priority Administration
initiatives like child care, education, and health care. Governor Chiles would support such an
approach if we dedicate the funds to children's health care, not just outreach.

B.     WORKERS BETWEEN JOBS DEMONSTRATION                                  !ex-Dump Conversion

        Families who lose health insurance while they are between jobs are a small but important
group of uninsured Americans. These people pay for health insurance for most of their lives,
but go through brief periods without coverage when they are temporarily unemployed. If they
experience a catastrophic illness during this transition, the benefit of their years' worth of
premium payments is lost. In addition, they could lose protection under the provisions of the
Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation once they regain coverage. Coverage at that point could be
subject to a new pre-existing condition exclusion period.

Limited Demonstration

        This policy option is a modification of the program that we have carried in our last two
budgets. It would award grants to several states to provide temporary premium assistance to
eligible low-income families. States would use this money to partially subsidize families'
premium payments for up to 6 months. To test how best to address this population's needs, we
would select states using a range of approaches like a COBRA-based subsidy, Medicaid, or
covering the parents of children covered by CHIP.

        Since it is a grant program, we could make this program as large or small as we want.
To give a sense of the options, last year's $10 billion proposal over four years covered about 3.3
million people with incomes below 240 percent of poverty. Ifwe assume the same set of policy
parameters, a demonstration of$1 billion over 5 years would cover about 230,000 people; a
demonstration of $2.5 billion would cover about 600,000; and a demonstration of about $3.5
billion would cover about 800,000 people. OMB has suggested that we could limit the costs by
reducing the eligibility for assistance to people below poverty. However, NECIDPC advisors
oppose such a limitation because it shifts the target away from the middle-class families we
originally intended to help.

Discussion

         On policy grounds, all of the agencies support this policy. Ithas been in our last two
budgets because of its merits. This policy remains Labor's first priority because it targets a
particularly vulnerable group and addresses the worker insecurity issues that played such a large
role in the debate over Fast Track. OMB would support this initiative ifthere are sufficient
funds. HHS believes that this policy is no more viable this year than it has been in the past;
HHS would also object to using Medicare and Medicaid savings to fund this proposal.
DPCINEC are concemed about dropping this policy altogether and support a demonstration that
is large enough to be viewed as improving coverage. If resources are limited, however, we
would prefer the children's outreach initiative to this proposal.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
C.     VOLUNTARY PURCHASING COOPERATIVES

        Workers in small firms are most likely to be uninsured. Over a quarter of workers in
firms with fewer than 10 employees lack health insurance - almost twice the nationwide
average. While 88 percent of workers in firms with 250 or more workers are offered health
insurance, only 41 percent of workers in firms with less than 10 workers are offered coverage.
This disparity reflects the poor functioning of the small group health insurance market. Studies
have shown that administrative costs are higher and that small businesses pay more for the same
benefits as larger firms.

Grants to States

        Given the disadvantages faced by small firms, the question is: are there policies that can
make insurance more affordable for small businesses and their employees? In the last two
budgets, we have included a policy to provide seed money for states to establish voluntary
purchasing cooperatives. These cooperatives would allow small employers to pool their
purchasing power to try to negotiate better rates for their employees. This year, we propose both
the original policy and a variation: a competitive grant approach so that a more limited number of
states could receive a smaller, but more targeted, pool. of funds. The total costs would be $50 to
$100 million over 5 years.

Discussion

        All agencies remain supportive of this policy and believe it should be included in this
year;s budget. In the past, we have failed to enact this proposal because Congressman Fawell
has pushed an alternative approach more attractive to small businesses. Fawell's proposal
would help small businesses to self-insure and in so doing escape all state regulation.
Governors and consumer groups have consistently opposed the Fawell approach, fearing that it
would leave the small group market with only the most risky and expensive groups, as low-risk
groups move into the self-insured, non-regulated market. Our recent conversations with Fawell
suggest that he may be open to compromise this year in a way that he has not been in the past.

     MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                 BRUCE REED

     SUBJECT:       Reforms that Prepare Medicare for the Retirement of the Baby Boom Generation


             The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) that you enacted took critically necessary steps to
     modemize the Medicare program and prepare it for the twenty-first century. It extended the life
     of the Trust Fund to 2010, invested in preventive benefits, provided more choice of plans for
     beneficiaries, strengthened our ongoing fraud activities, and lowered cost growth to slightly
     below the private sector rate through provider payment reforms and modest beneficiary payment
     increases. However, the BBA's policies were not intended to solve the long-term problems
     posed by the retirement of the baby boom generation.

            The Medicare Commission was established to address the demographic challenges facing
     the program. The question is whether we can and should do anything prior to the March 1999
     Commission deadline that could further strengthen the program and lay the groundwork for
     implementation of likely Commission recommendations.

             The NEC and DPC have led an interagency examination of several targeted policy
     options. This memo examines options for coverage for pre-65 year olds, Medicare coverage of
     patient care costs associated with clinical trials, and a project to increase awareness of private
     long-term care insurance. Financing options to pay for these proposals folI'ow this description.

             Your advisors have differing views on whether to pursue any new proposals while the
     Medicare Commission is active and which proposals to pursue if you choose to do so. OMB
     and to some extent Treasury have concems about a pre-65 option, because it may open the door
     to subsidies for a costly population and have the unintended effect of reducing employer
     coverage. Both OMB and Treasury oppose the clinical cancer trials proposal because it could
     set a precedent for every other disease group asking for the same treatment.

             Traditional Medicare savings alone may not be sufficient to offset the costs of these
     proposals. In particular, a decision to propose a pre-65 policy may be feasible only if the
     decision is made to propose an income-related premium. An income-related premium may be
     more politically acceptable to our Democratic base if it were linked to a benefit expansion.
     However, given the broad ramifications of this policy, a separate discussion outside the context
     of this memo will be required.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
A.     PRE-65 HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS

        Although people between 55 and 65 years old are generally more likely to have health
insurance, they often face greater problems gaining access to affordable health insurance,
especially when they are sick. Individuals in this age group are at greater risk of having health
problems, with twice the probability of experiencing heart disease, strokes, and cancer as people
ages 45 to 54. Yet their access to affordable employer coverage is often lower because of work
and family transitions. Work transitions increase as people approach 65, with many retiring,
shifting to part-time work or self-employment, as a bridge to retirement. Some of this transition
is involuntary. Nearly half of people 55 to 65 years old who lose their jobs due to finns
downsizing or closing do not get re-employed. At the same time, family transitions reduce
access to employer-based health insurance, as individuals are widowed or divorced, or as their
spouses become eligible for Medicare and retire.

        As a result, the pre-65 year olds, more than any other age group, rely upon the individual
health insurance market. Without the advantages of having their costs averaged with younger
people (as in employer-based insurance), these people often face relatively high premiums and,
because of the practice of medical underwriting, may be unable to get coverage at any price if
they have pre-existing medical conditions. While the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation improved
access for people with pre-existing conditions, it did not restrict costs.

        These access problems will increase because of two trends: the decline in retiree health
coverage and the aging of the baby boom generation. Recently, firms have cut back on offering
pre-65 retirees health coverage; in 1984, 67 percent oflarge and mid-sized finns offered retiree
insurance but in 1997, only 37 percent did (although this decline may be slowing). In addition,
in several small but notable cases (~, General Motors and Pabst Brewery), retirees' health
benefits were dropped unilaterally, despite the firm's prior commitment to their retirees. These
"broken promise" retirees do not have access to COBRA continuation coverage and could have
difficulty finding affordable individual insurance. An even more important trend is
demographic. The number of people 55 to 65 years old will increase from 22 to 30 million by
2005 and to 35 million by 2010, over a 50 percent increase. Assuming current rates of
uninsurance, this trend could raise the number of uninsured in this age group from 3 million
today to 4 million by 2005, without even taking into account the decline in retiree health
coverage.

       The last reason for considering the coverage issues of this age group is the likelihood of
proposals to raise Medicare eligibility age to 67, consistent with Social Security. The
experience with covering a pre-65 age group now will teach us valuable lessons if we need to
develop policy options for the 65 to 67 year olds.

        Policy Questions. Two central questions guide policy decisions in this area: what is the
target population, and what is the best way to cover these people.




                                                2
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
        Whom to Target. As with any incremental reform, targeting is essential to reduce the
chance that the policy does not unintentionally offset or reduce employer health coverage.
While this policy will not affect employers' decisions to offer coverage to their current workers,
it may affect employers' decisions to cover retirees, as well as employees' decisions to retire
early. At the same time, the current level of employer dropping suggests that a policy for the
affected people is needed. Although your advisors remain divided on the advisability of
implementing a new policy in this area, we all agree that any policy protect should against
substitution by limiting eligibility to a subset of the pre-65 year olds. There are two design
approaches to achieve this.

        The first approach is to limit eligibility to people ages 62 to 65. The 6 million people
ages 62 to 65, compared to people ages 55 to 59, work less (48 percent versus 74 percent), are
more likely to have fair to poor health (26 versus 20 percent), and are more likely to be uninsured
or buy individual insurance (28 versus 21 percent). In addition, it is also the age at which Social
Security benefits can be accessed. Within this 6 million, we could limit eligibility to the 2
million without access to employer or public insurance, and would require that they exhaust
COBRA coverage before becoming eligible. These steps should reduce the likelihood that the
policy will lead individuals to retire or drop retiree coverage.

        A second approach is to limit eligibility within a broader age group -.!<.J1., 55 to 65 year
olds - to individuals who lack access to employer-based insurance for particular reasons:
(1) Displaced workers: About 60,000 people ages 55 to 65 lost their employer insurance when
they became lost their job because a firm closed, downsized, or their position was eliminated.
(2) Medicare spouses: As many as 420,000 people lost employer-based family coverage when
their spouses (almost all husbands) turned 65 and retired. This number could grow if employers
drop retirees' dependent coverage for these spouses as a result of this policy. (3) "Broken
promise" people: A small but visible and vulnerable group is the pre-65 retirees who lost retiree
health coverage due to a ''broken promise" @., when the employer unexpectedly terminates
coverage).

        How to Provide Coverage. The second question is: what is the best way to increase
access to affordable insurance? One approach is to extend COBRA continuation coverage for
longer than 18 months. Currently, COBRA allows workers with insurance in firms with 20 or
more employees to continue that coverage for 18 months by paying 102 percent of the premium'.
The major problems with extending COBRA are that (1) people in small firms are not eligible,
(2) businesses will consider the policy an unfunded mandate, and (3) the policy could lead to
discrimination against hiring older workers. In addition, firms could use this longer COBRA
mandate as an excuse to not cover any employees. Despite these difficulties, a COBRA
extension appears to be the best option for the "broken promise" people, since the former
employer would bear some of the costs of its decision to terminate coverage and COBRA could
then serve as a "bridge to Medicare" for this population.




                                                 3
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
        A second approach, preferable for most of the target groups, is a Medicare "buy-in."
Eligible people could buy into Medicare at the age-adjusted Medicare payment rate, plus an
add-on for the extra risk of participants. Because the actuaries think that most participants will
be sicker than average, this add-on will be costly. To attract healthier people and make it
possible for more people to take advantage of the benefit, we could defer payment of the
additional cost until age 65 by "amortizing" this payment. Under this scheme, Medicare would
pay part of the premium as a loan up front, with repayment by the beneficiaries with their Part B
premiums after they turn 65. The HCFA actuaries have estimated that this Medicare "loan" in a
worse-case scenario would cost $1.1 billion per year assuming participation of no more than
300,000 people. Because the preliminary estimates assumed that only sick people would
participate and that all would enroll in one year, and because they did not take into account the
pay-back from beneficiaries, the official estimates, expected soon, will probably be lower.
Subsidies would be considerably more costly and your advisors agree that we cannot afford it.

       These target populations and ways to cover them can be combined in three options.

         Option 1. "Broken Promise" People Only. The minimal option, with no Federal
cost, that employers who break their promise of providing retiree coverage extend COBRA so
that retirees can buy into their active employer plan at a higher premium, as has been done for
other special COBRA populations until age 65.

        Option 2. Medicare Buy-In for Select Groups. The second option is to allow a
limited group of 55 to 65 year olds to buy into Medicare. One group is the "Medicare spouses"
- primarily uninsured women ages 55 to 65 whose husbands are already on Medicare. An
alternative (or complement) is displaced workers who often do not have access to
employer-based insurance. Both groups are small, so that costs would be low.

        Option 3. Medicare Buy-In for 62 to 65 Years Old Plus Selected Groups. The third
option is to allow 62 to 65 year olds plus a group like displaced workers to buy into Medicare.
The cost of this option is not yet known but will likely be less than $5 billion over 5 years.

Discussion

         Despite likely b1l;siness opposition, your advisors all support Option 1, a COBRA option
for the "broken promise" people. Beyond this, there is not yet a consensus on policy
recommendations. OMB is concemed that anypre-65 proposal's ''unsubsidized'' entitlement
will not stay that way for long as pressure builds to lower the premiums. If the goal is a limited
test of a buy-in for the pre-65 year olds, it would recommend Option 2, covering the Medicare
spouses, since this is a discrete group whose eligibility would likely have a smaller effect on the
general trend in retiree health coverage or retirement. The Department of Labor favors both
Option 2 and 3, so long as we include displaced workers, since this in line with their broader
theme of improving workers' security. In the absence of a Medicare buy-in, Labor would
support a COBRA extension, despite its problems. HHS supports covering the select groups in
Option 2, but is concemed that the enrollment be sufficient to justify the administrative effort.
         HHS and NECIDPC recommend Option 3, that we have a Medicare buy-in for 62 to 65

                                                 4
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

year olds plus displaced workers. We think that this is a sufficiently narrow group to limit
significantly the effects on retiree health coverage or retirement. This group is also more
representative of the 65 to 67 year old population, giving a better sense of what would happen if
Medicare eligibility were postponed to 67 years old. Although Treasury is concerned that this
policy could become an underfinanced policy expansion, some concerns would be allayed if the
buy-in participants were enrolled only in managed care, so that the insurers and not Medicare
bear the risk. This approach, however, could be politically difficult given the distrust of
managed care.

       It is important to note that we are still waiting for the detailed analysis of these options
from the Office of the Actuary. That will give all advisors a better sense of the implications of
the choices and could alter recommendations.

B.     PRIVATE LONG-TERM CARE OPTIONS
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
         A second idea to improve access to insurance focuses on long-term care. Unlike acute
care, long-term care is not primarily financed by private insurance, which pays only 6 percent of
its costs. Medicaid pays for 38 percent, Medicare pays for 21 percent, and families pay for 28
percent of the costs out of pocket. This large government role may not be sustainable as the
baby boom generation retires. Today, one in four people over age 85 lives in a nursing home.
This could increase substantially as the proportion of elderly living to age 90 is projected to
increase from 25 percent to 42 percent by 2050. Thus, it is important to encourage the
development of private insurance options. The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation took a step in
this direction by clarifying that certain long-term care insurance is tax deductible. But because
many people incorrectly assume Medicare covers all of their long-term care needs and do not
know about private long-term care insurance, more action is needed. This action could include
providing information to Medicare beneficiaries about private insurance, funding a
demonstration program to improve the quality and price of private insurance, or both. None of
these options includes a new Medicare entitlement or subsidy.

Information on Quality Private Long-Term Care Insurance

        We propose to leverage our role in Medicare to improve the quality of and access to
private policies. HCFA would work with insurers, state regulators, and other interested parties
to develop a set of minimum standards for private long-term care policies. If a plan met these
standards, Medicare would approve its inclusion in the new managed care information system.
(As a reminder, the BBA included provisions to provide annual information on managed care
choices to beneficiaries.) This proposal would build upon that system and cost up to $25 million
in discretionary funds over 5 years ($5 million in FY 1999), distinct from the user fees currently
authorized for the managed care information system. We also could propose a demonstration
that would test the feasibility of a partnership between Medicare and private long-term care
insurance on a limited basis. The cost of a demonstration would depend on its size and policy
parameters, but could be limited to $100 to 300 million over 5 years.

Discussion

        We believe this proposal has significant potential and is worth further deVeloping. There
is some concern at HHS that coming to an agreement on a set of standards could be difficult and
that insurers may argue that our standards drive up the cost of the policies, making them
unaffordable. HHS also would prefer that any demonstration be funded through the mandatory
budget. However, these concerns may not be insurmountable, especially since one objective of
a demonstration could be to investigate high quality private options that are affordable. Finally,
we are still looking into the feasibility and advisability of using tax incentives to encourage the
purchase of private long-term care policies and/or the use ofIRAs for long-term care financing,
although Treasury is concerned about the advisability of such options.

C.     MEDICARE COVERAGE OF CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS

        Medicare has not traditionally covered patient care costs associated with clinical
trials. Scientists and advocates believe that we are not making sufficient progress in
treating cancer, in part because the lack of Medicare coverage limits participation in these
trials. HHS andDPC have been working on an approach that covers patient care for a
limited number of these trials. Additionally, the Vice President's office strongly supports
this proposal. Because of concerns about its cost, OMB and Treasury strongly oppose this
option.

        Nearly half of all cancer patients are covered by Medicare, yet Medicare does not
cover patient care costs associated with these trials. This care can often be prohibitively
expensive for cancer patients and their families, perhaps explaining why only 3 percent of
all cancer patients participate in trials.. Expanding Medicare coverage could increase
access to trials for the many beneficiaries with cancer. Historically most insurers have
covered clinical trials for children. As a consequence, nearly 70 percent of children with
cancer participate in clinical trials. Scientists agree that this participation rate has helped
improve cancer treatments for children, and some argue that it is one reason for the
dramatically higher survival rates for children cancer patients.

         This problem has significant implications for research in all cancer areas,
particularly for those cancers like prostate cancer where scientists still have no good
answers and where clinical trials are particularly undersubscribed. According to a former
National Cancer Institute director, if 10 percent of all cancer patients participated in such .
trials, trials that currently take three to five years would take only one year. Additionally,
as the nation's largest insurer, Medicare plays a significant role in setting the standard for
the insurance companies. A commitment from Medicare to cover clinical trials would go a
long way to encourage private insurance companies to cover these trials.

Proposal

       We have developed a proposal to expand Medicare to cover cancer clinical trials
conducted at the NCI and trials with comparable peer review. In addition, we would
 .                                                     .
require a National Cancer Policy Board to make further c{lverage recommendations, and
HHS to assess the incremental costs of such trials compared to conventional
Medicare-covered therapies. Assuming the true incremental costs are substantially less
than the actuaries project, as we believe, additional trial coverage as recommended by the
Board could occur. The initial coverage would cost $1.7 billion over five years. Senators
Mack and Rockefeller have developed a more expansive and expensive proposal
(co-sponsored by 26 Senators), which covers all FDA trials, many of which the experts
believe do not meet a scientifically-meritorious standard. However, we do believe that
there may be some middle ground between our proposal and the Senators' proposal that
could be justifiable on policy grounds but more costly.




                                              7
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
        A'possible alternative way to cover clinical cancer trials' patient care costs is to
dedicate resources from any significant increases that NIH I NCI receive in the upcoming
budget. NCI could use these increases to simplify and centralize their clinical trials
system, which has the potential to increase patient access. Although this option may be
viable, the cancer community has clearly stated its preference for extending Medicare
coverage. Another possibility is to require drug companies desiring Medicare coverage of
additional clinical trials to contribute to part of the patient costs.

Discussion

       HHS is supportive of this policy and believes that it would not only give Medicare
beneficiaries, who represent a significant portion of cancer patients, much-needed choices
but would encourage the private industry to cover clinical trials as well. There is no
question that this proposal is the highest priority for most of the cancer community as well
as many in the women's community who believe it is an essential step to improve breast
cancer treatment. However, the advocates have made it clear that they would strongly
prefer the more expansive and expensive RockefellerlMack approach. Conversations with
the Senators suggest that they would support this proposal as an important first step; this
support will weigh heavily with patient groups and the cancer community.

         OMB and Treasury oppose the Medicare coverage option strongly. They note that
 it would involve very substantial costs ($1 to 3 billion per year) to provide medical services
 that are experimental, and therefore are unlikely to help the majority of beneficiaries.
 Once an exception has been made for experimental cancer drugs and therapies, they argue
 there is no reason that similar support won't be demanded for experimentation with
 Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other maladies. As a result, these costs will grow as other
 therapies are included. They also believe that Congress would likely expand the proposal
'beyond coverage ofNCI trials and that this expanded coverage will be very costly (up to $3
 billion over five years). OMB also believes that rather than Medicare leading the way on
 clinical trials, drug companies should be the first to contribute to improving access for
 Medicare beneficiaries.

         While recognizing the OMB and Treasury concerns, the DPCINEC believes that this
 policy has potential to contribute to important expansions of clinical trials and possible
 break-throughs in cancer treatment. We believe that we should investigate the possibility of
 amending the current policy to tap into the drug industry as a financing partner. In addition, we
 believe that this policy will be even more attractive if we are unable to fmd the resources to
 double the NIH budget. Although we support the cancer clinical trial policy, if we have
 limited resources available in Medicare and it comes down to a choice between the pre-65
 initiative and this one, we would recommend the former. Alternatively, if we do introduce
 an income-related premium, we would recommend that you use some of its revenue for this
,benefit since it represents a reinvestment in Medicare for current beneficiaries.

    D.     PAYING FOR INITIATIVES: MEDICARE ANTI-FRAUD AND
           AN INCOME-RELATED PREMIUM

           We assume that the funding for these Medicare initiatives will require Medicare offsets.
    One approach is to use Medicare anti-fraud initiatives. HHS and OMB believe that these offsets
    could total about $2 billion over 5 years. This could fund some, but not all of the initiatives
    described above. To fund a more expansive series of initiatives, you will probably have to
    consider an income-related premium. As you know, Medicare subsidizes 75 percent of the Part
    B premium for all beneficiaries, including the wealthiest. This policy is not only regressive; it
    ignores the fact that higher income beneficiaries actually cost Medicare more than poor
    beneficiaries. However, the addition of an income-related premium would constitute a move
    away from the concept of social insurance.

    Anti-Fraud Provisions

            In our ongoing efforts to reduce Medicare fraud, we have identified a number of small but
    important policies that could sum to about $2 billion over five years. Several of them address
    problems identified by the HHS Inspector General, such as the overpayment by Medicare for
    certain cancer drugs, highlighted in recent press reports.

    Income-Related Premium

           As you know, the Administration has publicly supported an income-related premium.
    However, it is not clear whether we should carry through on this support by including it in the
    budget. The Medicare Commission will definitely consider and probably recommend this
    policy. Yet, there remains some Democratic opposition to this policy and some of your advisors
    would counsel not to move unilaterally in this direction. Because this issue is extremely
    controversial, this description is not intended to present recommendations but to begin a
    discussion of the topic.

            Building from our position last summer, the income-related premium would be
    administered by the Treasury Department, not HeFA or the Social Security Administration.
    Eligible people would fill out each year a Medicare Premium Adjustment form (a separate form
    or a line on the 1040 form) and send a check to "The Medicare Trust Fund." The two open
    questions are: who pay and how much do they pay. The answers to these questions determine
    costs, but the more modest proposals generate about $8 billion over five years.

           Who pays. The income thresholds determine how many people are paying the higher
    amount. We proposed thresholds of $90,000 for singles and $115,000 for couples in the Health
    Security Act. Last summer, the Senate, including most centrist Democrats, passed a policy
    where the extra premium payment began at $50,000 for singles and $65,000 for couples. During
    the budget debate, we did not state publicly our support for any particular thresholds.




                                                   9

                                                                              Automated Recorcs Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dump Com'ersion
             How much. The amount of the payment for the wealthiest beneficiaries is a second
     question. In the budget debate, we argued that a 100 percent premium (no subsidy) would cause
     some healthy and wealthy people to opt out of Medicare. However, an analysis by the Treasury
     Department this fall found that the effects of a 100 percent premium would be small. (About
     5% of beneficiaries who pay the full premium would drop.) HHS would strongly object to
     changing our position and supporting an income-related premium that completely phases out the
     Part B subsidy. Ifwe decide to change our past policy, it might be advisable to have a strategic
     discussion about the timing of announcing such a change. It could be an important in
     negotiating the give and take on this issue.

     Discussion

               The decision to include an income-related premium is a complicated one. On one hand,
     it is alinost certain that this policy will be recommended by the Medicare Commission. At that
     point, however, we will have less opportunity to direct any of its revenue toward important
     Medicare reforms like a Medicare buy-in. On the other hand, many Democrats and possibly
     AARP will oppose the income-related premium as a beneficiary payment increase. A possible
     exception is if it is explicitly linked to a Medicare investment or possibly a pre-65 policy. In
     addition, Republicans might label it a new tax and use our support for it as an issue during the
     1998 campaign.

             Although our discussions are ongoing, the agencies believe that the decision to propose
     an income-related premium depends on the context. OMB's position ultimately depends upon
     the entire package of initiatives and savings being offered. OMB considers the income-related
     premium to be a sound policy option, but believes that it should be considered as a means to
     offset Medicare Trust Fund insolvency or provide benefit expansions for the currently eligible
     Medicare population. HHS believes that if an income-related premium is pursued, its savings
     should be used for Medicare. HHS further notes that Medicare has already contributed $115
     billion in savings and that we may wish to preserve this option for the Commission
     recommendations lest we have the Commission with no reasonable options. DPCINEC will
     prepare for a separate meeting to discuss this issue.
