MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                   BRUCE REED
                        ELENA KAGAN
                        TOM FREEDMAN

SUBJECT:                KENTUCKY TRIP AND ROUNDTABLE WITH TOBACCO
FARMERS

        On Thursday, April 9, you will travel to Carrollton, Kentucky to meet with tobacco
farmers, community leaders, and children. During this trip, you will reaffirm your commitment
to protect tobacco farmers and their communities, while also emphasizing the need to reduce
youth smoking. The trip will also allow you to express support for a plan to protect tobacco
farmers authored by Senator Ford that is included in Senator McCain's legislation.

Structure of the Trip

        You will first travel to a tobacco warehouse where you will hold a roundtable discussion
on how to protect farmers and their communities. The participants in the discussion are
expected to be a local farmer, a farmer who represents growers statewide and has worked well
with the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, a minority farmer who has raised many foster
children using her revenue from tobacco, the owner of the warehouse you are visiting, a student
who wants to be a farmer, the head of the state farm bureau, a local religious leader, and a
community activist who has helped bring farmers and health advocates together. Secretary
Glickman will also participate on the panel, and Governor Patton and Senator Ford will be
present but speak at the second event.

        After the roundtable, you will travel to a school where you will address students and
reinforce the message of reducing youth smoking.


Background on Kentucky Tobacco Farmers

      There are two main types oftobacco, flue-cured and burley. Burley tobacco is the
primary crop in Kentucky, with revenues of more than $800 million in 1997 for the nearly
450 million pounds grown. In 1997, approximately 70 percent of the burley tobacco
produced in the United States came from Kentucky. The majority of burley tobacco
producers in Kentucky favor continuation of the federal price support program.

       Many Kentucky tobacco farms are very small. The average Kentucky tobacco

                                                1
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

farm plants only 4.5 acres of burely tobacco. In contrast, flue-cured tobacco farms in
North Carolina and South Carolina average 16.1 and 25.5 acres of tobacco per farm,
respectively. However, large farms dominate Kentucky's burley tobacco business. Last
year, 70 percent of the total burley sold came from only 26 percent of the farms.

        Tobacco is a major part of the Kentucky economy. Tobacco sales account for over
40 percent of the total crop revenue for Kentucky, and over 20 percent of all agricultural
sales in Kentucky.

       According to USDA, Kentucky experienced an abnormal year for their 1997 burley
tobacco crop. Adverse weather conditions resulted in tobacco with high moisture content
that was of a generally low quality and received a lower prices than expected.

Tobacco Program Background

         Since the 1930s, tobacco prices have been supported and stabilized by the federal
government's commodity support program. One part of the program involves limiting
supply through a quota program. A quota entitles the owner to grow a certain percentage
of the national supply of tobacco for that year. Under the quota program, the government
determines each year how much tobacco the companies expect to buy, how much will be
sold overseas plus a modest reserve, and then divides up the right to grow that full
amount among the quota holders. The burley quota can be sold, rented or leased. In
addition, the tobacco program guarantees an acceptable price at which farmers can sell
their tobacco. The price-support system ensures that farmers can sell tobacco at a
statutory minimum price to their cooperatives if companies cease to buy on the open
market. In this program, the government loans funds to the cooperatives to purchase
tobacco, which are repaid from the proceeds of future sales.

        Producers of the different kinds of tobacco vote in triennial referenda to determine
if they wish to continue the federal tobacco program for their kind of tobacco. In a
referendum in late February, 97.5 percent of burley producers voted to continue the price
support-production control program.


The AG's Settlement Agreement

        The settlement agreement with the Attorneys General did not outline a plan to
compensate farmers for the diminished domestic tobacco sales that might result from
comprehensive legislation. You, however, made protecting tobacco farmers and their
communities one of the five key elements of your plan for comprehensive tobacco
legislation.

Legislative Background

       Three types of legislative approaches for farmers have been discussed. First,

                                             2
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
Senator Lugar proposed legislation that would quickly "buy-out" quota owners from the
governmental system at approximately $8 a pound. In Senator Lugar's plan, tobacco
prices would then be subject to the free market. Second, Senator Ford proposed
legislation that would maintain the current quota system, while also compensating
farmers (up to $8 per pound) for the difference between the prices they would have enjoyed
without legislation and the diminished prices they may experience. Senator Ford's bill
also includes transition fund for communities. Finally, Senator Robb had proposed
legislation that would combine elements of both of the above approaches. He sought to
buy-out farmers, but replace the quota system with a production control system based on
permits. Unlike quotas, permits would be given only to those who actually grew tobacco
and could not be bought or rented.

        Senator Ford's proposal, the LEAF Act, appealed mostly to burley growers like
those in Kentucky who have small farms and want to continue the quota program.
Senator Robb's approach gained some support from flue-cured farmers (based mainly in
North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia) who believe the buy-out and license system
better fits more capital-intensive flue-cured production. Senator Lugar's approach has
not attracted widespread support; even tobacco-state senators like McConnell who
philosophically favor this approach probably will not come out for it publicly.

Farmers' Legislation Included in McCain Tobacco Bill

        Senators Ford, Frist, and Hollings, the three members of the Senate Commerce
Committee from tobacco-growing states, joined together to include a generous farmer provision
in the McCain tobacco legislation. While maintaining a production control system for all
tobacco farmers, this package sets up somewhat different systems for burley and flue-cured
tobacco. For burley tobacco (grown mostly in Kentucky), the package includes an optional
buy-out for quota holders at $8 per pound, and retains the quota system for those who do not take
the buyout, but provides payments to both remaining quota holders, lessees, and tenants to the
extent that base quota declines. For flue-cured tobacco, the plan provides for a mandatory
buyout of existing quota holders, and replaces the quota system with a permit system that gives
the new no-cost permits to active producers, regardless of whether they previously held a quota.
This transferring of quotas from inactive quota holders to actual producers was part of the
Senator Robb's proposal and is intended to make it possible for active farmers to sell tobacco
without incurring the cost of buying or renting quota. The McCain package also provides
approximately $500 million for assistance to tobacco-producing communities. The package
costs $2.1 billion per year for the first ten years and $500 million for years 11-25 for a total of
$28.5 billion. For the most part, tobacco farmers are very pleased with the proposal included in
the McCain legislation.

Below is a table with the major provisions for tobacco farmers in the McCain legislation.

Secretary Glickman's Trip to Kentucky

        Last Friday, on April 3, Secretary Glickman and Tom Freedman traveled to Lexington,
Kentucky to attend a Farm Forum at Gentry Tobacco Warehouse with 600 to 700 farmers,
goveniment officials, and agribusiness leaders. The farmers were generally supportive of the
Administration. Their main concerns were that the tobacco program be kept in place and that
small farmers not be adversely affected.
