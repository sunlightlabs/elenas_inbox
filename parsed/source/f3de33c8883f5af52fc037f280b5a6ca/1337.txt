TEXT:
Elena, when you have a chance can you review the draft welfare reform
outreach memo (you should have a copy, but I attached another just in case
not.)   I think the sooner we can put together a cohesive DPC-run outreach
strategy, the better.   Everyday, I receive a number of calls from outside
organizations and agencies alike asking questions, asking for written
material, direction, etc.   It would be great to get a strategy off the
ground.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM          BRUCE REED
               ELENA KAGAN

Subject        Welfare to Work Outreach Strategy


This memo is a response to a Feb. 25 meeting between the Chief of Staff s Office, DPC, White
House Counsel, Public Liaison, Intergovernmental Affairs, and HHS at which welfare to work
outreach strategies were discussed. Following are decisions made about additional outreach
steps, a summary of ongoing outreach efforts, and a suggested structure to create a more
comprehensive and coordinated outreach and communications effort.

Outreach Decisions

The following decisions were made at the 2/25 meeting. Outreach and external coordination will
be focused on four key groups: state governments and their social service offices; the business
community; the nonprofit sector; and the faith communities. Outreach efforts will include but
will not be limited to recruiting nonprofits, businesses, and religious organizations to the effort,
building comprehensive lists of those committed, creating a referral network for individuals and
organizations to relevant programs, assisting businesses and other entities with welfare to work
programs, and preparing written material to educate states, nonprofits, business, and faith
organizations about best practices on welfare to work.

A main vehicle for outreach will be to establish four private spokes people -- one for each of the
outreach areas -- who will carry the Administration's welfare to work message to state
governments, and the business, nonprofit and religious communities.

However, counsel has written that it will be legally difficult to recruit individuals to volunteer as
spokes people for the welfare to work effort. Counsel says that there is no problem discussing
issues with private individuals and indicating that we would like them to work on particular
matters. However, we cannot direct a private person's activity and we must be careful not to
give that person the impression that she holds an official position or that her activities are
government sanctioned, or that she is acting on behalf of the White House.

Outreach Efforts To Date

Several outreach activities have been ongoing since the passage of the welfare law. Following is
a summary of those ongoing activities.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


      You are traveling to various state legislatures to challenge legislators to make welfare
       reform a success, and you are offering the legislators examples of what is working in
       other states and communities. HHS is currently putting together a suggested list of other
       states you might visit.

      You have met with and talked to 14 CEOs interested in becoming involved in the welfare
       to work effort, many of whom are also working with Eli Segal, the NGA, and the          .
       National Alliance of Business (NAB). You announced five of these CEOs during your
       State of the Union address. Additionally, the Office of Public Liaison and the DPC are
       building a list of more corporations interested in becoming involved. Presently, the list
       tops 100 and is growing. We are sharing this list with Eli Segal and others.

      You and Mrs. Clinton have met with religious leaders both at the White House Prayer
       Breakfast and at the Congressional Prayer breakfast, both times challenging the faith
       community to help with the welfare to work effort. The Office of Public Liaison is
       currently coordinating a broader outreach effort to all faith-based institutions.

      Public Liaison has held several briefings for organizations interested in welfare to work
       and will continue to do so.

      The Department of Health and Human Services has consistently provided technical
       assistance and guidance to states as they implement their welfare to work plans.

Also key to our outreach will be to connect with and build on newly emerging welfare to work
efforts. Following are private outreach efforts underway.

      Eli Segal's Work Now (WN) will soon be established as a 501 (c)(3) organization who's
       mission will be to help businesses of all kinds move people permanently from welfare to
       work. WN's customers will be the businesses themselves, rather than welfare recipients,
       legislatures, Governors, or state welfare agencies. WN will encourage, mobilize, reward,
       and provide technical assistance to large and small companies and a broad range of
       so-called intermediaries that act as job placement and retention organizations.

      The NGA is beginning a process that connects Governors with private sector employers
       interested in hiring welfare recipients. In addition, the NGA will be collecting model
       programs and best practices for distribution in states. (White House Intergovernmental
       Affairs recently facilita!ed a meeting between Eli Segal and the NGA to discuss the
       welfare to work initiatives of both entities and possible areas of collaboration.)

      The National Alliance of Business (NAB), a Washington, DC-based business supported
       and led organization that helps companies with workforce development, is beginning its
       welfare to work initiative. NAB hopes its initiative will make employers involvement in
       the welfare to work effort more effective.

                                                2
Coordinating the Outreach Strategy                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
Though outreach efforts are underway within the Administration and through private nonprofit
organizations, both the outreach efforts and the welfare to work message are fragmented and lack
coordination. We believe we should build upon existing and new outreach efforts to create a
coordinated and comprehensive outreach and communications strategy. Following is a brief
outline of what such a strategy might look like.

The following three-part plan should be run by the White House -- specifically the DPe, Office
of Public Liaison, Communications, Cabinet Affairs, and Intergovernmental Affairs -- and is
designed to ensure that the work provisions of the new welfare law are successfully
implemented.

      Interagency Coordination. Coordinate all intergovernmental efforts related to welfare to
       work, particularly those ongoing at HHS, Labor, HUD, and the Departments of
       Commerce and Transportation, (add National Service Corps, etc.) through regular
       meetings and conference calls with a designated group. With the help of the involved
       agencies, catalogue all welfare to work related activities ongoing at the agencies into one
       central document and regularly update that document.

      Outreach. Through outreach, build a comprehensive list of state legislators, nonprofit
       organizations, businesses, and faith organizations interested in becoming involved in the
       welfare to work effort who we need to educate. At the same time, build a list of those
       states, legislators, and private organizations with good programs in place to whom we can
       refer others.

      Communications. Discover, disseminate, and celebrate model public and private welfare
       to work efforts and existing Federal government programs that will help states,
       nonprofits, businesses, and religious organizations structure successful welfare to work
       programs. Disseminate information through written materials, public liaison briefings,
       the World Wide Web, and a speakers bureau made up of representatives from all of the
       agencies and departments involved.
