Update on National Testing Initiative: A White House/Education Department team has been
working to refine and implement the strategy for fighting the Goodling amendment outlined in
our memo earlier this week. Among the key steps that have been taken:
텹egislative
       Secretary Riley has announced that we will be sending up legislation shortly to put
        NAGB in charge ofthe tests. This has help to solidify support in the business
        community. Rep. Riggs has been very supportive of this move, and will use it to explore
        the possibility of reaching a compromise with Goodling. We remain doubtful that
        Goodling wants to compromise, but have encouraged Riggs to proceed. The legislation
        will be transmitted by the beginning of next week. We are also reaching out to Diane
        Ravitch and similar opinion leaders in an effort to reinlist their support.
       Secretary Riley has been making calls to key members in both houses in an effort to shore
        up our support and explore any avenues for compromise. Similar stafflevel
        conversation have also been proceeding.
       Representatives George Miller, Bill Clay, and Martinez are sending a "Dear Colleague"
        letter in support of the tests and in opposition to the Goodling amendment.
Outreach
       Supporters in the education and business community have stepped up their efforts to
        contact key members of Congress; a number have also submitted op-eds in support of the
        tests.
       Meetings have been set up with groups from the minority community in an effort to
        address their concerns.
       We have enlisted the support of mayors and governors from participating cities and
        states.
Communications
       Your radio address will be used to highlight the importance of national standards and
        tests, and the threat it faces in Congress.
       Secretary Riley will participate in an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday with Mayor
        Rendell and Superintendent Hornbeck [Elena--POTUS knows Dave Hornbeck very well]
        to highlight impressive test score gains over the last two years--inc1uding gains among
        LEP students on tests in English.
       An education event is being planned for the Vice-President for next Thursday, and a
        conference call with business leaders is being arranged for Wednesday.
