MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  BRUCE REED
                       MIKE COHEN
                       SECRETARY RILEY


SUBJECT:               CaliforniaProposition 227 (Unz Initiative) to end Bilingual Education


         On June 2, California voters will consider Proposition 227, English for the Children, an
initiative which proposes to eliminate all bilingual education and require that all students be
taught in English, regardless of their primary language or level of English comprehension. This is
California's third potentially divisive race-related initiative in four years, following on the heels
of Proposition 187 which barred public benefits for illegal immigrants, and Proposition 209
which ended affirmative action.

         Latino activists are strongly opposed to Unz, and are looking to the White House for
strong and visible support of their efforts to defeat Unz. Polls consistently show that the
initiative is popular, even among Latino voters, and is likely to pass. While many expect Latino
support to decline considerably as voters become more familiar with the details of the proposal, it
is clear that the initiative taps frustration with highly publicized problems in some bilingual
education programs as well as widespread disatisfaction over the performance of the public
schools, particulary with regard to Hispanc students.

        Despite legitimate concerns over the ineffectiveness of bilingual education as it is
currently implemented in many places in California and throughout the country, your advisors
strongly believe that the Unz initiative is bad education policy and will be harmful to students
who need help the most. .Despite some tricky politics, we believe that it is both good policy and
good politics to oppose Unz, coupled with proposals to "mend, not end" bilingual eduation. This
memo provides the background, rationale, and specific recommendations for this approach.
I.      The English for the Children Initiative and Bilingual Education in California

A. Overview of English for the Children (Unz) Initiative
        This initiative, authored and backed by Silican Valley millionair Ron Unz, is designed to
end all bilingual education programs in California. More specifically, it would:
       Require that all public school instruction be conducted in English.
       Permit this requirement to be waived only if parents or guardians can show that the child
        already knows English, has special needs, or would learn English faster through an
        alternative instructional technique.


                                                 1




                                            \
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


        Provide initial placement for Limited English Proficient (LEP) students in "sheltered
         English immersion" programs for one year. Instruction in these programs would be
         conducted in English, with some accomodations in the curriculum to take into account
         the limited English language skills of the students.
        Appropriate $50 million per year over 10 years to fund adult education programs that
         teach English, to adults who pledge to provide English language tutoring to LEP students.
        Makes teachers, administrators and school board members personally liable for failure to
         implement the provisions of the initiative, and subject to suit by parents or guardians.

        Unz and other backers of this initiative make clear that they regard the existing system of
 bilingual eduation in the state as a complete failure. They argue that Latino and other
 immigrant parents want their children to learn English more rapidly than occurs at present. They
 charge that because bilingual education relies so heavily on use of the students' native language
 and only slowly introduces English, the approach delays or prevents, rather than promotes, the
 acquisition of English. Further, they point out that though California's bilingual education law
 expired a decade ago, the legislature has been unable to enact legislation to reform a broken
 program. This initiatve, they argue, will break the legislative impass and dramatically change
 bilingual education policy for the better.

           Opponents criticize the Unz Initiative on a number of counts. Critics argue that the
  initiative is harmful to children, because it relies on a single, unproven approach that provides an
  unrealstic time period in which to learn English, and will result in grouping students in the same .
  classes regardless of language, age or grade level. They argue that the one-size-fits-all approach
. eliminates a parent's right to chose the best approach for their child (and point out that the waiver
  requirements in the Unz initiative are extremely burdensome and unlikely to be used effectively,
  particularly by immigrant parents). They point out that the Unz initiative provides no
  accouritabilty, because it lacks any requirements for assessing students' academic progress.
  They also point out that the Unz Initiative undermines local control and the ability of local school
  boards to determine important education policies, and wrongly subjects educators to lawsuits.

 B. The Context of Bilingual Education in California

         Demographics. There are approximately 1.3 million Limited English Proficient (LEP)
 students in California, approximately xx%ofCalifornia's K-12 students .. This number has
 nearly doubled in less than a decade, and represents some 43% of the national total. Seventy
 nine percent of California's LEP students are native Spanish speakers. Hispanics have a 50%
 dropout rate, and by most indicators their academic performance lags behind most other
 population groups in the state.

         Educational Services. LEP students receive a wide variety of types of services intended
 to help them learn English and academic subjects. In 1997, only approximately 30% receive
 what is conventionally considerd bilingual education--programs which make significant use of
 the student's primary language to teach academics while phasing in greater amounts of English

                                                   2
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

language instruction. Approximately 16% are not receiving any language instruction services at
all. The remainder--more than half-- participate in specially designed instructional programs
that help students learn English through a combination of approaches such as direct instruction in
grammar, voacbulary and communications, and instruction in academic subjects that is designed
to be accessible to LEP students. The California Department of Education estimates that there is
a shortage of 21 ,000 qualified bilingual education teachers.

         While the rationale for the Unz Initiative is the perceived failure of bilingual education in
California, less than a third of the eligible students actually participate in it. And the Unz
initiative if enacted would eliminate. virtually all of the programs now providing services to LEP
students.

        Significantly, none of the Unz opponents we spoke with in the education or advocacy
communities were prepared to argue that bilingual education, or any other form of services to
LEP students in California, is currently effective on a large scale basis. While program
evaluations show that there are promising efforts using a number of different approaches, in the
main there is a strong sense that shortages of qualified teachers and poor implementation has
limited the effectiveness of many existing programs. In addition, most observers agree that the
overall poor academic performance and high dropout rate of Hispanic students reflects serious
weaknesses in schools that extend well beyond language services for LEP students.

        California Legal Framework. The legal framework for providing services to LEP
students in California is particularly murkey. California's Bilingual Education Act sunseted in
1987, though under California law the overall purposes of the program remain in effect, even
while the more specific design, programatic and administrative features do not. The State Board
of Education regulations implementing the act have remained in effect, and provided the state
legal framework for bilingual education. Under this framework, school districts were required
to help students become fluent in English and competent in other academic subjects, and were
given a significant amount of flexibility in determining how to achieve these goals. Neither
bilingual education nor any other specific approach to teaching LEP students was required.

        There have been a number of unsuccessful attempts in the past decade to enact new
legislation, but bilingual education reformers and advocates have been unable to agree on an
approach. There has been a fresh attempt over the past month to craft compromise legislation,
partly to take the steam out ofUnz and partly to give Unz opponents something to be for.
However, it is not clear that longstanding disagreements can be overcome this time. Nor is it
considered likely that Gov. Wilson will sign compromise legislation.

        Last week the California State Board of Education took the first step toward eliminating
the state bilingual education regulations entirely. This process should be completed shortly
before the vote on Unz. While neither the motivations behind this step, nor its full implications,
are clear, it appears that the overall impact will be to eliminate any state law or regulations
regarding services to LEP students, and to give local school districts even greater flexibility in


                                                  3
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
the future than in the past, subject to applicable federal requirements.

       Federal Legal Framework. Federal requirements originate in the Due Process and
Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and provisions of the Equal Educational
Opportunities Act (l9XX) which require educational agencies to take appropriate action to
overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by students in instructional programs.

       As interpreted by the courts, these provisions do not require any specific form of services,
such as Bilingual Education or English as a Second Language programs. Rather, they require
the provision of supplemental language instruction that is based on sound educational theory, is
adequately resourced and implemented, and is evaluated and modified as necessary.

        These requirements afford local school districts in California considerable discretion to
fashion programs and services according to their specific needs and resources. Rather than
requiring a specific approach, they require that whatever approach is used be implemented
effectively. IfUnz is enacted, many expect that it will be challenged as a violation offederal
law. However, prior to enactment, there is no basis to support that view. However, if services
mandated by Unz are not implemented effectively, there is likely to be a strong basis for a legal
challenge.

        The federal Bilingual Education program (Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act) is an additional source of federal direction for participating local school districts.
However, this competitive grant program also provides local school districts with considerable
discretion in the type of services provided to students.


II.    Political Context

        The Unz initiative is the clearly the most serious threat to bilingual education, but it is not
likely to be the last such threat. Earlier this year Speaker Gingrich proposed eliminating the
bilingual education, and conservatives from English-only advocates to more serious scholars
troubled by the lack of clear evidence of effectiveness (e.g., Diane Ravitch) have also called for
the elimination of bilingual education. Especially if Unz passes, we are likely to see energized
opposition to the federal program, and escalated opposition in other states and local
communities.

         The Unz initiative presents a political dilemma in California. If we oppose it, we
risk alienating a majority of California anglo voters. If we fail to oppose it, we risk alienating a
vocal and increasingly influential group of Latino leaders, and possibly Latino voters.

       Current polls show that a majority of all voters, and especially a majority of California
Anglo voters, support Unz. For Anglos, bilingual may become the hot button issue that
immigrant services and affirmative action were. Anglos are angry about spending money on


                                                  4
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
biligual education and want it stopped

       In contrast, Latino voters are split on the issue ofbiJingual education. Latino activists
and electeds oppose Unz. To some of the Latino leaders, this is a limitus issue, like Propositions
187 and 209. It is being viewed as a cultural attack and as racially motivated. Private
conversations and press accounts suggest that Latino leaders are looking to the White House to
become actively involved in the opposition to Unz, and are beginning to become fearful that we
may sit on the sidelines when California consideres eliminating educational opportunities for
Latino children, until it is too late, .

          Polls and anecdotal evidence show that show that Latino "voters" currently support
Unz. Latino citizens believe the education system is failing to lift their children up to the
standards of anglo children. They are frustrated and want a better choice for their children's
education, and this frustration is being translated into support for a proposition that purports to
help their children learn English rapidly. However, most Latino leaders and activists believe
that as Latino voters become better education about the particulars of the Unz initiative, Latino
support will decline considerably.

        The political dilemma can be resolved with a "Mend it / Don't End it" response.
We can strike a middle ground between Latino leaders, possibly Latino voters, and anglos by
admitting that bilingual education needs mending, but Unz is not the way to do it. More
specifically, we can:
       Oppose Unz on the merits because it is too extreme;
       Remind voters what we are for, including our overall approach to strengthen public
        education and, within that, our Hispanic initiative aimed largely at increase academic
        achievement and high school completion among Hispanics;
       Propose to "mend" the federal bilingual eduation program through steps that will
        strengthen local control (and lift the cap on English programs); create expectations for
        learning English within a fixed period of time; strengthen accountability for students and
        programs alike by testing for English proficiency; and promoting our efforts to strengthen
        progam quality by increased investments in teacher training.



       The timing of making a decision public is important.
       Legislative Compromise: The Assembly may very well accept Amendments to the
        Senate bill that produces a compromise piece of legislation on biligual education for the
        Governor's signature. Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa does not believe the
        Governor will sign bilingual education legislation. Regardless of the legislation's
        ultimate success, the President should not take a possition that would create partisan
        motivations for the Governor to gratuitously oppose legislation. The legislature is
        hoping to complete a bill by mid to late March.



                                                  5
                                                                   llcx-Dump Conversicn


       1998 Gubernatorial Candidates: Before the President takes a public position, we
        must consult with the gubematiorial candidates.

       Setting a polite political tone: One advantage of taking a position in the next month
        is that we have an opportunity to take an offensive position and set a polite tone rather
        than get involved in an inflammatory one.       The closer to the election, the more likely
                this debate will devolve into a mud slingiing race debate. If our objective is to
       support
        effective education for the 21 st Century, we could make this an opportunty for fitting
        bilingual education into that kind offramework.

III.   Specific Recommendations

1. Oppose Unz within next 4 weeks
message--mend, don't end
messenger--POTUS, VPOUTS, Riley (we either need to make a recommendation, or layout
pro's and con's???)

2. Specific recommendations for changing federal program
     strengthen local control by lifting cap on English programs
     create expectation (but not hard deadline) for learning english
     accountability for kids and programs--test kids for English proficiency within time period
      and require corrective actins for kids not measuring up; require corrective actions and
      possible loss of funds for programs not measuring up (unless this is already in current
      law)
     continued efforts to pay attention to quality regardless of the type of program--rhetoric
      about standards, highhight our budget increase in teacher training within bilingual ed
      program.
