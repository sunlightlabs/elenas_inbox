MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                      ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:              WELF ARE-TO-WORK IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

As you know, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) recently sent us a memo outlining
numerous proposals for ensuring that federal agencies hire welfare recipients. Based on this
memo and our conversations with OPM staff, we suggest the following package of measures.

1.     Direct each federal agency to present to you in 30 days a plan for hiring and
       retaining welfare recipients in Federal government positions.

The agency plan should include the following:

A.     A survey of Agency hiring capacity under all hiring authorities

Each agency would work through the Federal Executive Boards (FEBs) and the Federal
Executive Associations (FEAs) around the country to survey where the agency can hire welfare
recipients and in what sort of jobs.

While we would encourage agencies to pursue all hiring options -- excepted hiring
authorities as well as the normal competitive hiring process -- the excepted hiring process,
particularly the Worker-Trainee program, are the most viable avenues through which to
hire welfare recipients.

The five existing excepted service programs are each targeted to a specific group and
boasting simplified hiring procedures: the Veteran's Readjustment Appointment Program;
the Severely Handicapped Appointment Program; the Presidential Management Intern
Program; the Student Career Experience Program; and the Worker-Trainee Program.

The Worker-Trainee program was designed to attract very low-skilled persons into the Federal
workforce. It is a quick and easy way to hire individuals into trainee-type positions where
needed training in basic skills and developmental experiences are offered. The program has
been in place since 1968 but is currently not widely utilized. Provisions of the program include
the following:

      May hire individuals at grades GS-l, WG-l, WG-2, or the equivalent
      May promote to grades GS-3, WG-4, or the equivalent
      Initial appointment is a term like appointment
      After three years, may convert to career status
                                                                                               system
                                                                                   1 aoement
                                                                      d Records 1'v an t>
                                                             Automate            .
                                                                         ConversIon
                                                             Helt-DutnP
                                                               Ilex-Dump Conversion

B.      An outreach plan describing in detail how the agency would reach out to welfare offices,
employment offices, nonprofit organizations, and others that work with the welfare population on
a regular basis to notify them of job opportunities within the Federal government.

C.       A plan describing in detail how each agency would prepare and mentor welfare recipients
who are hired by the Federal government to ensure that once hired, the welfare recipient retains
her job.

D.      A plan on the manner in which the agency, through the FEBs and FEAs, will report
regularly to the President on both the )1iring and retention of welfare recipients under the
Worker-Trainee program.

Approve: __                          Disapprove: __

2.      Direct the General Services Administration (GSA) to issue in 30 days from the
directive guidelines to Federal agencies on uses of the Federal Fare Subsidy Program,
including the option to offer fare subsidies on a sliding income basis, as allowed under the
Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act.

The 1993 Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act permits the Secretary of each Federal
agency to establish programs that may involve such options as transit fare subsidies including
passes, vouchers, and other cash reimbursement. As of 1994, only 10 agencies offered transit
fare subsidies to 31,000 employees. The low usage exists because of the high cost of offering all
employees fare subsidies. The subsidies range from $15 to $60 per month and are paid out of
each agency's appropriations.

You could make clear that agencies have legal authority to offer graduated subsidies based
on income and direct agencies to do so. If agencies choose to offer fare subsidies on a sliding
income scale basis, usage rates will likely rise and will directly benefit low-income workers who
may otherwise have difficulty affording transportation to and from work.

Approve: __                          Disapprove: __

3.     Direct the GSA to work with all Federal government agencies to explore and report
to you in 30 days their available options to help low-income federal workers find affordable
child care.

The report should include but not be limited to the following:

A.     The feasibility of establishing more agency-sponsored child care centers.

B.     The extent to which the agency has already contracted with local child care resource
and referral services to help low-income employees find affordable child care and their
plans to expand this option.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
C.     Agency interest in offering direct child care subsidies based on a sliding fee scale to
low-income employees of the Federal government. Currently, the Department of Defense,
under the Military Child Care Act of 1989, operates subsidized child care centers for its
employees. At an average cost of $6,800 per employee. DOD absorbs the cost of this
program. If agencies are interested in creating a child care subsidy program similar to
DOD's, legislation would be required.


Approve: __                          Disapprove: __


4.      Direct (WHO???) to inform all employees eligible for the EITC of both their
eligibility and their ability to receive EITC monies each month in their paychecks.

IRS currently undertakes similar outreach efforts to the private sector, requiring private sector
employers to notify their EITC-eligible employees. However, similar notification is not
conducted on a regular government-wide basis. The Federal government needs to do what the
private sector is already doing.

Approve: __                          Disapprove: __

5.    Call for legislation to allow the Federal government and its agencies to utilize the
wage subsidy program in the same manner any other private nonprofit or for-profit
employer would use the program to subsidize the wages of a welfare recipient.

You might consider calling for a legislative change that would provide agencies with a
monetary incentive to hire welfare recipients. Under current law, federal agencies cannot
take advantage of subsidies offered to employers who hire welfare recipients, because
agencies may not receive any unappropriated funds. A simple piece of legislation would
allow federal agencies to accept and retain these subsidies, thus giving agencies the same
incentives to hire welfare recipients as other employers. This proposal, however, might
well provoke opposition, with some arguing that the states should not have to pay the
federal government to put welfare recipients to work.

              Approve: __                           Disapprove: __
