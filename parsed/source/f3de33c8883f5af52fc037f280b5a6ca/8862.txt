Elena,
Attached is a draft of the briefing materials for the POTUS's meeting
tomorrow with the Hispanic Caucus.  I checked w/Maria reo NACARA.  She
agrees that the President should not express support for legislation that
includes amnesty for the Hondurans. Also, I need to coordinate with OMB
on the naturalization backlog plan -- to finalize where we are.

Background

The Administration has developed a plan to make federal immigration activities more effective
by separating enforcement and service operations within INS -- from headquarters to the field --
while preserving the necessary integrating functions for supporting and coordinating both
operations. Congressman Reyes developed an alternative proposal that was introduced by Rep.
Rogers last week. This bill would create an agency within the DOJ that would handle all
immigration enforcement; however, the Rogers bill does not address either reforms to the
services operation or overall immigration policy coordination. Our legislation was recently
transmitted to the Hill and was introduced by Senator Kennedy and Representatives Watt and
Berman on Thursday, July 30th.

We -- along with the House Democratic leadership (including Rep. Becerras) -- have been trying
to persuade Rep. Reyes to work with the Administration on a proposal that meets all of our goals.

Talking Points

      The focus of the Administration's reform effort is to untangle the INS's overlapping and
       frequently confusing organizational structure and replace it with two clear organizational
       chains of command -- one to provide immigration-related services and the other to
       accomplish its enforcement mission. This separation will result in an INS organization
       with better accountability and improved efficiency that allows each operation to focus on
       the unique management, knowledge, skills, and abilities of its function. The most
       dramatic feature of our reform plan is the elimination of the district system and the
       creation of local offices that are focused either on services or enforcement.

      We believe that the Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR) recommendation to
       disband the INS and reallocate its primary responsibilities to the Department of Justice
       (DOJ) and the Departments of State and Labor would only compound the current
       problems with the nation's immigration system. To be most effective, all immigration
       policy and management should remain within one agency at the Justice Department.

      The Administration did consider Congressman Reyes's proposal to pull enforcement
       operations out of INS into Main Justice. Consistent with Congressman Reyes's
       recommendation, our plan consolidates all enforcement operations to create a single point
       of responsibility and accountability. However, because of the variety of ways in which
       service officials depend on data collected by enforcement officers, and vice versa, to
       ensure the integrity and effectiveness of both functions -- as when, for example, a service
       officer discovers that a person has overstayed their visa and become an illegal alien -- we
       decided that both operations would work best when housed within a single entity.

Background

The hnmigration Control and Refonn Act of 1986 (IRCA) legalized the immigration status of
certain aliens who had been unlawfully present in the United States since before January 1982.
IRCA provided for a one-year application period for this benefit, ending in May 1988. The
INS's implementation ofthe legalization program was challenged on the ground that the INS
dissuaded some individuals from applying within the requisite time period. Despite a 1993
Supreme Court decision severely limiting the class ofthose potentially hanned by INS's action,
much class action litigation continued.

Section 377 of the 1996 hnmigration Act brought this litigation to an end by removing federal
court jurisdiction from cases where the claimant didn't actually file a legalization application
within the specified period, or couldn't show that they attempted to file during the time period
(by presenting a completed application and application fee) and were turned away. This
provision was supported by the Administration because the Department of Justice believes that if
an individual either did not file during the window period or cannot demonstrate that they
attempted to file but were deterred, they are not entitled to relief under IRCA.

Many immigration advocates are concerned that hundreds of thousands of individuals who have
resided legally in this country for years will become deportable in the near future as a result of
this provision. Many of these individuals claim to have been in the United States since before
January 1,1982, and few would be able to secure any other fonn of relief from deportation (the
standard for "cancellation of removal" under the 1996 Immigration Act is much stricter than the
equivalent "suspension of deportation" standard that existed prior).

Talking Point

      The Justice Department supported the enactment of Section 377 in an effort to bring an
       end to lengthy litigation covering individuals without bona fide claims to legalization.
       However, I have asked my staff to look into this further and welcome your thoughts on
       this matter.

Background

The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), enacted during the
last session of Congress, authorized the more lenient (pre-I 996 Act) rules for suspension of
deportation to apply to pending cases of Guatemalans and Salvadorans, but provided amnesty
(automatic "green cards") for Nicaraguans and Cubans. The Hispanic Caucus and many
Central American advocates have urged the Administration to implement NACARA in a way
that would achieve "parity" between all Central American groups affected by the legislation. In
addition, since last fall, Congressmen Gutierrez and Becerra have advocated strongly for amnesty
for Salvadorans and Guatemalans (equivalent to that received by the Nicaraguans and Cubans).
Also, Congressman Gutierrez has introduced a bill that would give amnesty to Salvadorans,
Guatemalans, Haitians and Hondurans. We have consistently taken the position that Hondurans
are not similarly situated to the Central American groups covered by NACARA, and thus have
opposed special relief for this group.

Talking Points

      I share your concern about the disparities in treatment in NACARA. As I indicated in
       my signing statement, we are seeking to minimize these disparities in the implementation
       process.

      In this regard, the Attorney General has authorized a new administrative procedure for
       adjudicating the cases of Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and Eastern Europeans covered by
       NACARA. This procedure will empower INS asylum officers to decide the suspension
       claims of these individuals (in addition to the review currently available by immigration
       judges). This modified procedure will be less adversarial than immigration court and
       will thus lessen the need for representation by an attorney, thus reducing the cost.

      Also, the INS will issue a regulation that codifies existing case law on adjudication of the
       "extreme hardship" standard to ensure that there is fair and consistent interpretation of the
       case law as it applies to this class of applicants.

      We expect that these changes will result in a generous approval rate.

      I am generally supportive of efforts to achieve parity among similarly situated groups --
       however, I would have to review any proposed legislation before deciding whether to
       support it.

                                                                     Automated Records Management System
Background                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

Many immigration advocates have expressed serious concerns over the naturalization
backlog and INS' proposed immigration service fee increases -- primarily for
naturalization. The dramatic increase in naturalization applications (from 540,000 in FY
1994 to almost 1.6 million in FY 1997), along with a greater focus on the integrity rather
than the speed of the naturalization process, has resulted in an increase in the number of
pending applications. As of the end of May 1998, nearly 1.9 million applications were
pending. Currently, most applicants are experiencing a wait of 18-24 months.

Talking Points

     I agree that the growing backlog is unacceptable. My Administration is committed to
      both management refonns and providing the resources necessary to reduce waiting times.
      In the past year, the INS has implemented several refonns to the naturalization process
      that are designed to expedite processing, while maintaining integrity. We recognize,
      however, that INS's efforts to date represent just the first steps in a long road -- enonnous
      challenges lie ahead, and we are committed to meeting those challenges expeditiously.

     As you may be aware, my 1999 budget proposed reducing the average waiting time
      for applications to 10 to 12 months by the end of 1999 and 6 to 8 months by the end
      of 2000. It was based on INS' projections showing an average of 1.6 million new
      applications in FY 1999. The INS now estimates that it will receive 46% fewer
      applications than prior estimates. Fewer applications are a double-edged sword:
      while INS staff must process fewer new applications, INS also loses fee revenues.

     In light of the new INS projections, we have developed a new plan to meet the
      backlog reduction targets outlined in the Budget. The plan provides a package of
      management reforms, process improvements, and additional resources that together
      will reduce the backlog and improve customer service.

     Under the new plan, INS will:

      a.     implement management improvements by establishing a new Deputy Executive
             Associate Commissioner for Immigration Services who will focus exclusively on
             benefits service delivery with a mandate to reduce the naturalization backlog,
             continue reengineering of adjudications processes, and improve customer service.

      b.     establish backlog reduction teams comprised of adjudicators dedicated to
             naturalization application processing. The teams will be concentrated in the five
             cities that represent 65% of the backlog -- Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York,
             Miami, and Chicago.
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

c.   implement reengineering improvements (recommended by Price Waterhouse
     Coopers) including implementing a comprehensive national phone center,
     consolidating medical waiver and complete file review at service centers, and
     implementing the Guide to Naturalization ensuring standard procedures
     across the agency.

d.   receive an additional $148 million in FY 1999 dedicated to reduce the
     backlog;

e.   implement the immigration services fee increases, including a fee waiver
     policy, in October, 1998, to better reflect the true cost of naturalization.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

              State & local law enforcement performing immigration functions

Background

The 1996 Immigration Act pennits the Attorney General to delegate certain immigration
functions to state or local law enforcement officers. The immigrant advocacy community is very
concerned about this level of cooperation between the INS and local law enforcement. They
fear that this delegation will lead to violations of civil and constitutional rights on the part of
insufficiently trained and perhaps wrongly motivated local police. Advocates are also concerned
that this delegation will make immigrants fearful of cooperation with local police departments on
other law enforcement matters.

Last year, the Attorney General agreed to conduct a one-year pilot project to implement this
provision in Salt Lake City, Utah. After negotiations among the Department of Justice
(including INS, the Civil Rights Division and the Community Relations Service) and the local
police department. local police and community representatives, an MOU was prepared and is
ready to be executed by the INS and the local mayor, pending city council approval. A
companion MOU between INS and Salt Lake County is being negotiated, and is tentatively
scheduled for signature on the same day.

The Salt Lake City MOU allows a small group of selected, trained, and supervised police officers
to conduct immigration-related questioning and arrests after a lawful arrest has been made on
state criminal grounds or repeat municipal offenses. After the pilot is completed and evaluated,
the INS will propose a plan for full implementation ofthis provision and publish this plan in the
Federal Register for comment.

Talking points

      The Department ofJustice is taking careful steps to implement this provision of the 1996
       Act.

      As in other areas, we want to promote the use of tools that assist local law enforcement in
       doing their jobs effectively, while maintaining vigilance in protecting people's civil
       rights.

      The Attorney General will initiate a pilot project to implement this provision in Salt Lake
       City. The development of this pilot was done in conjunction with the local police
       department, community advocates and civil rights groups. We hope that the pilot will
       assist us in identifying how best to implement this provision, consistent with protecting
       the civil rights of those affected.

      I welcome your input throughout this process.
