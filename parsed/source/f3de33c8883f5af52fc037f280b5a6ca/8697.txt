 I was correcting a typo on the one pager and noticed that the version we
 sent to you is missing part of Mike's piece on public schools.  We will
 make sure to get this fixed in the morning (Saturday) -- since I don't
 have a way to fix this tonight. The attached version has corrected the
 typo.  Sorry for the confusion.

                         Promoting Discipline and Safety in Schools
                                      July 17, 1998

In his speech to the AFT today, the President will discuss the importance of school discipline and
safety to the nation. He will announce a White House Conference on School Safety and
highlight some of the school safety policies promoted by the Administration -- school uniforms,
tough truancy laws, community-based curfews, and zero tolerance for guns.

White House Conference on School Safety

      National School Safety Day. The President will proclaim October IS, 1998, National
       School Safety Day and host a White House meeting that will be linked by satellite to
       schools across the country and specifically include the communities impacted by the
       recent wave of school shootings.

      First Annual Report on School Safety. The President will also issue the first Annual
       Report on School Safety, which wifI include: an analysis of all existing national school
       crime data and an overview of state and local crime reporting; examples of schools and
       strategies that are successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and class disruption;
       actions that parents can take locally to combat school crime, including a local safety
       checklist; and resources available to schools and communities to help create safe,
       disciplined, and drug-free schools.

Promoting School Discipline

      Spreading school uniform policies across the country. Since President Clinton
       highlighted school uniforms in 1996, a growing number of schools have adopted uniform
       policies. This includes some the nation's largest school districts -- New York City, Dade
       County, San Antonio, Houston, Chicago and Boston. In New York City alone, more
       than half a million elementary school students will be wearing uniforms by fall of 1999.

      Improving school attendance and safety in Long Beach, CA: In the 1995-96 school
       year -- the third year school uniforms were required -- attendance at the Long Beach
       Unified School District K-8 schools reached the highest point ever recorded during the 17
       years the district compiled these statistics. With excused absences for illness added in,
       attendance exceeded 99%. And between the 1993-94 school year (before uniforms were
       required) and the 1996-97 school year, total school crime dropped 76%.

      Keeping kids off the street and in school. Community curfews are designed to help
       keep children out of harm's way, enhance community safety, and give parents an
       important tool to impart discipline, respect, and rules. A recent survey by the U.S.
       Conference of Mayors showed that 276 of347 cities surveyed -- or 80% -- had youth
       curfew laws, up from 70% in 1995. And in New Orleans, a community-supported
       curfew -- combined with summer jobs and recreational programs for youth -- helped cut
       juvenile crime during curfew hours the year after it was implemented.
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

      Taking on Truancy. In 1996, at the President's direction, the Education Department
       issued a guidebook to the 15,000 school districts nationwide, outlining the core
       components of a comprehensive truancy prevention policy and highlighting model
       mltIatIves. Since then, the Department has also provided grants to local school districts
       to develop innovative truancy prevention programs.

      Enforcing Zero Tolerance for Guns in Schools. In October 1994, President Clinton signed
       into law the Gun-Free Schools Act, and issued a Presidential Directive later that month to
       enforce "zero tolerance" for guns in schools -- if a student brings a gun to school, that
       student will be expelled for a year. In school year 1996-97, the U.S. Department of
       Education estimates that, under zero tolerance policies, 6,093 students were expelled from
       public schools for bringing a firearm to school.

Challenging Congress to Strengthen Public Schools

         President Clinton will caB on Congress again to support his efforts to improve and reform
K-12 education by raising standards for students and teachers, strengthening accountability, and
expanding public school choice. The President has proposed the strategic investments necessary
to ensure that our children are prepared for the 21st century, by reducing class size, modernizing
our schools, investing in technology, expanding after-school learning opportunities, raising
standards and ending social promotions. The President will criticize the Congress for the steps
it has recently taken that short-change our schools and seB our students short, by cutting $2
billion from his request for education investments, and in the process scaling backing needed
initiatives on education reform, on raising educational achievement for our children, and on
providing focused help for students who need it most. He will also caB on Congress to support
efforts to
