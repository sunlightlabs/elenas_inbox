FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      JUNE 23, 1998

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


 DOD Authorization Bill/China: Senate Democrats tOday effectively blocked
a vote on any of Senator HutchinsonD,s China amendments (to the DOD
authorization bill) .  Daschle lead most Democrats in opposing a tabling
motion against the amendments (failed 14-82), thus preventing the tabling
motion from being characterized as a vote on the amendments.   In doing so,'
Daschle said: "I'm not going to allow one single vote on China this week.
We're not going to embarrass this President."   The Senate will resume
consideration of the DOD Authorization Bill on Wednesday (following the
vote on education savings accounts); Lott hopes to complete action on the
bill late Wednesday or Thursday.
