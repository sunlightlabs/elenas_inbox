MEMORANDUM FOR ELENA KAGAN

FROM:                    THOMAS FREEDMAN
                          MARY SMITH

SUBJECT:              Equal Pay Data Collection

        This memorandum describes several alternatives for improving collection of wage data
by the federal government. Last year, the Administration endorsed Senator Daschle's bill which
currently contains only a Sense of the Senate provision, recognizing that the Administration
should look into ways to collect this data. A previous version of Dasch Ie's bill contained a
general provision that required employers to submit wage data to the EEOC, broken down by
race, sex, and national origin, but this provision was removed at the Administration's request.
Recently, however, Senator Daschle has made it clear that he intends to return some kind of data
collection provision to his bill before Equal Pay Day on April 8 -- either what he previously
included or some other recommendation from the Administration. This memorandum outlines
how the federal government currently collects wage data, how it uses this data, and what efforts
could be made to improve data collection.

1.     Current Methods of Collecting Wage Data

        There are three major uses of wage data: enforcement, technical assistance, and research.
Both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor's
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) currently collect data that is used for
enforcement. The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census both collect data that
is used for informational and research purposes, but not for enforcement.

       A.     EEOC

        The EEOC currently collects annual data regarding the demographic breakdown of the
workforces of private employers with 100 or more employees and of federal contractors with 50
or more employees on the EEO-l form. However, the EEOC does not currently collect salary
data with respect to private employers. (The EEOC does collect pay data from state and local
governments through the EEO-4 form.) The EEOC uses the data on the EEO-l form, after an
individual claimant's charge is filed, to examine a company's practices. In addition, the EEOC
uses this data to determine whether it will file a Commissioner's charge, a charge filed by the


                                                1
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
EEOC, not by a private citizen.

      After a charge is filed, the EEOC can investigate and obtain wage data from an individual
employer. This data could then be used in litigation. However, by statute, the data on the
EEO-! is subject to privacy protections, and the EEOC cannot give this data to the public.

       B.      OFCCP

         OFCCP currently collects wage data from contractors when they are performing an
compliance review on-site. While OFCCP is on-site, they obtain detailed wage data on
individual employees. OFCCP has taken this data off-site in some instances. They use this data
to settle cases with contractors and ensure that contractors correct their pay policies. OFCCP
also uses the EEO-! form in helping to determine which contractors they will audit. Recently,
OFCCP has requested wage data before venturing on-site, at the earlier stage of the audit called
the "desk audit" phase. However, they are formally requesting OMB to allow them to do this
for all cases.

       C.      BLS and Census

        In general, BLS gathers data from employers and from households. In virtually every
case the respondents contribute information voluntarily. BLS, in tum, pledges to maintain the
confidentiality of all survey responses and the identity of survey respondents.

        The household-based surveys are the principal source of data on earnings by demographic
variables such as sex and race. The employer-based surveys do not gather wage data on a
demographic basis. BLS believes that voluntary employer-based surveys are not useful vehicles
for obtaining demographic information.

       The Census also collects some wage data by household but not by employer.

         New Wage Gap Report. As announced by the Vice President last year, BLS will soon
be issuing a report on women's earnings. This report will provide greater detail than previous
reports. The data will be culled from the Current Population Survey (the major household
survey). BLS intends to publish figures on women's earnings by various characteristics, such
as full-time and part-time status; union status; occupation; educational attainment; and marital
status. This compendium of tables will be accompanied by a brief analytical text.

II.    Possible New Methods of Collecting Wage Data

        Below are listed some options for collecting wage data for enforcement, technical
assistance, and informational purposes.

       A.      Wage Data for Enforcement and Technical Assistance



                                                2
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
       If data were collected for enforcement or technical assistance, either the EEOC or OFCCP
should collect this data.

               I.      EEOC

       The most likely way for the EEOC to collect this data would be to add back in a provision
to Daschle's bill. The old version of Daschle's bill provided for the collection of pay
information by the EEOC from employers with 100 or more employees, analyzed by the race,
sex, and national origin of the employees. It was somewhat vague on exactly how the wage
data would be collected. In particular, it did not specify that the data needs to be collected on
the EEO-I form, which is the form used by the EEOC to collect employment data.

         Senator Harkin's bill also requires employers to submit wage data with respect to job
category, sex, race, and national origin. Unlike Senator Daschle's bill which requires employers
with 100 employees or more to submit this data, however, Senator Harkin's bill requires
employers with 25 or more employees in the first two years and 15 or more employees in
subsequent years to submit this data. Furthermore, under Harkin's bill, the EEOC is authorized
to publish this data and may provide specific employer's reports to the public. This provision is
very controversial. As noted above, Senator Daschle's bill had originally contained a requirement
for greater collection of wage data, but the Administration felt this would draw a great deal of fire
from Republicans and the business community and it was replaced with Sense of the Senate
language that the President should increase the amount of information available on wage
disparities.

         The main concerns with collecting data on the EEO-I form centered around opposition
from the business community and Congress. The EEO-I form has remained virtually unchanged
for the past 30 years, despite its review every 3 years for OMB paperwork clearance (most
recently in 1997). The nine occupational categories are so broad that each job category contains
many individual jobs. As a result, many in the business community perceive the EEO-I form as
a waste of time and money. (OMB estimates that adding wage data would likely increase the
compliance costs dramatically -- possibly by several hundred-fold -- although creating a
supplement to the form or limiting it to a subset of the reporting universe could mitigate some of
these costs.) Nonetheless, the EEOC believes that collecting wage data on the EEO-l form
would greatly improve its ability to target and prioritize discrimination cases. It also would
assist the Department of Labor (DOL) in targeting its enforcement efforts and monitoring
affirmative action programs.

        There is consensus that any attempts to add wage data to the EEO-l form will draw
immediate fire from the RepUblicans and the business community. Indeed, any announcement
                                                                                  a
of a process to determine the best way to gather this data would likely provoke rider and risk
the increase in funds requested for the EEOC in our FY2000 budget. (The budget requests
$312 million for the EEOC -- $33 million or 12 percent more than enacted in the 1999
budget. Almost one-third of the increase, or $10 million, will be used for our Equal Pay
Initiative. EEOC will advance outreach to businesses and employees to educate them

                                                                           H~)(4)ljmp Conversion

about the legal requirements for paying equal wages, provide technical assistance, improve
training for EEOC employees to better identify wage discrimination issues, and launch a
public service announcement campaign to highlight the wage gap.)

       We might consider adding in a more narrow provision to the Daschle bill such as a
supplement to the EEO-l form to send to a subset of businesses and/or federal contractors which
would require employers to disclose data on experience, education, race, wages, and gender.
This could be targeted on an industry basis. This data could be used for technical assistance and
enforcement by both OFc:CP and EEOC.

               2.   OFCCP

        There are two basic methods by which OFCCP could collect wage data: (1) a Scheduling
Request which is currently pending at OMB and (2) a new Affirmative Action Summary. The
Scheduling Request at OMB proposes to collect detailed wage data (which identifies individual
employees) by mail from the 5000 or so federal contractors that are scheduled for compliance
reviews each year. (Incidentally, OFCCP has already requested and received this same data
from some contractors without explicit OMB approval). While OFCCP currently is able to
obtain this data on-site at a later stage of the review process, this pending request seeks to get
detailed pay information on every single employee at a particular site by mail at the early "desk
audit" stage of the process. This data would be permitted to be used for technical assistance and
enforcement. The Department of Labor requested that the decision on this issue be extended by
90 days until May of this year.

         The other option for OFCCP to collect wage data would be in a proposed Affirmative
Action Summary (also known as 60-2). For several years, OFCCP has been authorized to issue
a regulation that would allow them to collect summary information from all the approximately
200,000 federal contractors, including wage data, by mail. OFCCP informs us that this proposal
currently is being reviewed by their Solicitor's Office. OFCCP believes the advantages of this
proposal are two-fold: (1) OFCCP will be able to get some idea of how the entire universe of
federal contractors, not only those scheduled for compliance reviews, are implementing the civil
rights laws; and (2) every federal contractor, simply by being required to compile this data, will
become more aware of how they can better implement the civil rights laws by paying equal
wages and preventing discrimination.

        Both of these options have received strong resistance from the business community and
strong support from the women's groups. OMB, DPC, and the Women's Office have met with
both contractors and the women's groups on the pending request at OMB. The business
community believes that the request is overly burdensome because businesses do not keep in a
readily available format the pay information that OFCCP is requesting. The business groups
also do not believe that this is the most effective method for OFCCP to determine whether
discrimination based on race, sex, and pay exists. They do not, however, have a better proposal,
but OMB is setting up a meeting between the business groups and Labor to discuss further the
issue. The women's groups, on the other hand, do not believe the pending request advances the


                                                4
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

data collection issue at all. The women's groups believe that this request is merely a
reaffirmation of existing OFCCP authority. In their minds, they believe that this request is
separate and distinct from trying to come up with other ways to collect wage data.

        As for the Affirmative Action Summary, even though the request has not even cleared
Labor, the business community is already gearing up for a fight on this issue. While the
women's groups believe this summary would be a powerful tool because it would reach every
single contractor, it is clear that Labor will not have this proposal ready for April.

       B.      Wage Data for Informational Purposes

        BLS and the Census Bureau would be the appropriate places to explore if we decide to
collect more pay data for informational purposes. BLS does not allow matching of its data with
the data gathered from enforcement or regulatory agencies, owing to the clear differences in the
respective missions. The Census Bureau and BLS have research programs that allow approved
researchers, under carefully structured conditions, to gain access to "microdata" (the basic
responses provided by survey respondents) in order to produce new research on relevant
economic or social issues.

       However, BLS asserts, as a general matter, that it can be a very complex undertaking to
add additional data to existing surveys or to expand the surveys' sample sizes. There are issues
regarding cost and design that have to be taken into account while balancing the desire for new
data with an attempt to maintain survey response rates and not add to respondent burden.

       In addition, Treasury has suggested funding a grant for a third party academic study.
They believe this would lead to useful information. We have asked them to draft a brief
proposal for our meeting on March 10.
