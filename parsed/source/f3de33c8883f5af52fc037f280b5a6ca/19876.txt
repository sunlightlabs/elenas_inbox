I.    Presentation of Democratic Proposal

II.   Possible Additions:

     Juvenile Justice: (Slaughter, H.R 3400) -Would direct existing juvenile justice funds to
      after-school prevention programs in areas with high crime levels or significant numbers
      of at-risk youth. Costs $1.25 billion over 5 years.
     Full-Service Community Schools: (Hoyer/ Lowey)- A full-service school integrates the
      delivery of quality education with whatever health, social and cultural services that are
      required in that community.
     After School Snacks: (Woolsey, H.R. 3086) - It expands the number of schools and
      students eligible to participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) at
      after-school programs. Current law only allows low-income kids up to age 13 to get
      subsidized snacks. This bill would extend that to age 18.
     Family and Medical Leave Improvements Act of1997: (Clay, H.R. 109) -Would
      amend the Family and Medical Leave Act to provide 24 hours of additional leave that
      workers may use for greater involvement in their children's education (including school
      activities, parent-teacher conferences or interviewing for new child care, etc.).
     Welfare to Work: Ensure accountability on the part of the states for the provision of
      child care services to TANF participants and those leaving TANF.
     Stay-at-Home: (Kennelly, H.R. 3292) - Extends eligibility of Child Tax Credit (CTC) to
      stay-at-home parents with children under 4. The credit would be equivalent to the
      current $500 tax credit plus an additional amount equal to the average increase in tax
      relief provided to two-worker families with a young child through the expansion of the
      DCTC.
     Background Checks: (Tauscher, H.R. 3686) - States must certify and maintain an
      enforcement mechanism for conducting background checks on Center-based providers
      and group home providers without charge to the provider. Costs $5 billion over 5 years.
     Grants to Businesses: (Tauscher, H.R 3686) - Directs the Secretary to make grants to
      States to provide grants to eligible entities to improve access to affordable, local, quality
      child care services.
     Child and Adult Food Program: (Tauscher, H.R. 3686) - Amends the National School
      Lunch Act to increase reimbursement rates for family or group day care homes under the
      child and adult care food program. Costs are $225 million over 5 years. (First section on
      Tier 2 program -- $40 million a year, second section on sponsor payments -- $5 million a
      year.)
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion



      Student Loan Deferral: (Tauscher, H.R. 3686) - Amends the Higher Education Act of
       1965 to provide for student loan deferral for certain child care providers under specified
       programs for federally insured loans, federally guaranteed loans, and Federal direct
       student loans. No specific cost known -- the Lazio/Tauscher Amendment (part of Higher
       Education bill passed authorizing "such sums as necessary".)
      The Child Care Public-Private Partnership Act: (Lowey H.R. 2719)- Directs the
       Secretary ofHHS to establish a business incentive grant program to provide child care
       through public-private partnerships. Costs $75 million over three years.
