    PRESIDENT CLINTON HIGHLIGHTS PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO
    QUALITY HEALTH CARE AT NEW HAMPSHIRE ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION
                           February 18, 1999

Today, President Clinton and Governor Jeanne Shaheen met with a panel of New
Hampshire residents who underscored the wide range of health care challenges currently
facing the nation. The President emphasized the importance of his proposal to provide targeted
tax credits, such as the proposed credit to defray the costs of long term care services, rather than
indiscriminately spending the surplus on across the board tax cuts. The President also
praised Governor Jeanne Shaheen's efforts to address many of these health care challenges
facing New Hampshire.

The President highlighted several of the initiatives in his FY2000 budget to improve access
to and quality health care, including:

      Addressing growing long-term care needs. The President's budget includes a
       historic new initiative to support elderly and disabled Americans with long-term
       care needs or the millions of family members who care for them. This initiative
       invests over $6 billion over 5 years in long term care, including a $1,000 tax credit to
       compensate for the cost of long-term care services; a new $625 million National
       Family Caregiver Program that helps states provide direct services and support for
       those caring for elderly family members with long-term care needs; a new proposal
       to enable States to expand home-and community-based care to the same income levels as
       for nursing homes under Medicaid; and a national campaign to educate Medicare
       beneficiaries about long-term care options. The President also praised New
       Hampshire's efforts to expand community based care services for Medicaid              .
       enrollees and to provide critical information to the elderly and chronically ill adults
       about their long-term care options.

      Improve economic opportunities for Americans with disabilities. More than 70
       percent of Americans with disabilities are unemployed, often because they face
       significant barriers, such as the fact that they may lose health care. The President
       has proposed a series of bold new initiatives to enable people with disabilities to
       return to work. This $3.2 billion (over 5 years) initiative includes full funding for
       the Jeffords-Kennedy-Roth-Moynihan Work Incentives Improvement Act which
       provides options for workers with disabilities to buy into Medicaid and Medicare; a
       $1,000 tax credit to help offset the cost of services and support people with
       disabilities need to work; and a new regulation that increases the amount that
       people with disabilities can earn and still maintain critical Social Security benefits.
       New Hampshire also provides community based services to individuals with
       disabilities through Medicaid. In recognition the state's innovation in this area, the
       Vice President recently announced that the state would a new grant through the
       Social Security Administration to help remove barriers to employment for people
       with disabilities.
                                                                1lex-Dump Conversion



   Helping small businesses provide health care coverage for their employees. The
    President's budget includes a $44 million investment in targeted tax credits designed
    to encourage small businesses to participate in voluntary purchasing coalitions, which
    provide more choices to small businesses and their employees and make health care more
    accessible. This initiative provides: a new 10 percent tax credit for small businesses who
    decide to offer coverage by joining coalitions; encouraging private foundations to support
    coalitions by allowing their contributions towards these organizations to be tax exempt;
    and offering technical assistance to small business coalitions from the Administrators of
    the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. Governor Shaheen has proposed legislation
    that creates voluntary small business purchasing alliance to reduce costs and increase
    options for small businesses offering health insurance to their employees. She believes
    that the key to making her proposal work is outside financing sources and as such
    strongly supports the Administration's proposal.

   Implementing the Children's Health Insurance Program, the largest investment in
    children's health in a generation. The Administration is committed to implementing
    the Children's Health msurance Program (CHIP) and has developed a national outreach
    campaign to sign up every child eligible for Medicaid or CHIP coverage. New
    Hampshire, under Governor Shaheen's leadership is one of forty-six other states who
    have already implemented the CHIP program, Healthy Kids, to provide health insurance
    to thousands of uninsured New Hampshire children.

   Protect Patients through a Strong, Enforceable Patients Bill of Rights. Once again,
    the President called upon Congress to pass a strong federally enforceable patients'
    bill of rights: with a range of patient protections including: guaranteed access to
    needed specialists; access to emergency room services when and where the need
    arises, access to a meaningful independent and external appeals process for
    consumers to resolve differences with their health plans, and the right to be
    compensated when a health plan's decision causes a patient to be harmed or die.
    The President is already doing everything he can to implement these protections by
    extending them to the 85 million Americans covered by Federal health plans.
    Governor Shaheen has also proposed managed care reforms through the HMO
    Accountability Act that includes new critical patient protections.
