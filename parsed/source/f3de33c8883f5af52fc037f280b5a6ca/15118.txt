MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                         ERSKINE BOWLES AND SYLVIA MATHEWS

SUBJECT:                      AMERICA 2000: A PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE TO
                              PREPARE OUR NATION FOR THE 21st CENTURY

This memorandum outlines the components of a comprehensive proposal for a Presidential
initiative on race.

ISSUES FOR DECISION

1) Whether you should appoint a commission that will help prepare Americans for the 21st
Century by working to improve race relations. 2) Whether you should do a series of town hall
meetings with the commission. 3) Whether you should hold meetings every other month 'Yith
the commissioners at the White House.

(If you choose to deliver a speech on April 24 in which you announce the commission members,
Bob Nash informs us that we need to have them selected and notified by this Monday, April 7.
Even if we start the vetting process April 7, Bob feels that it would be a challenge to have all
fifteen commissioners vetted in that time frame. The next opportunity to deliver a speech in
which you announce the commissioners would be sometime during the week of May 12, after the
Service Summit and your Mexico trip.)

BACKGROUND

This memorandum describes a proposal that will help implement your call to the American
people that we must become "One America" and must confront unresolved issues of race and
bigotry. As we discussed with you on March 25, we have concluded that any efforts in this
area must include: 1) action on this issue; 2) an examination of the difficult issues involved in the
nation's racial tensions; and 3) recommendations for addressing these problems.

This memo will discuss the various components of this proposal: 1) Mission; 2) Goals and
Actions; 3) Commission; 4) Town Hall Meetings; 5) Commission Meetings at the White House;
and 6) Report. A separate memo will discuss our plan for working with other groups which are
not included in the scope of this initiative, but are concerned about discrimination and equality
issues.

Mission

The mission of this initiative is to enable America to prepare for the 21 st Century through a
nationwide program of dialogue, study and action addressing the issues of race and pluralism.
                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

This initiative is occasioned not by an immediate crisis but rather by your long term commitment
that we enter the next century a strong and united country: strong because we will benefit from
the talents of all our people; united because we will overcome the divisions of race that have
deprived too many Americans ofthe full benefit of their citizenship and deprived the rest of us of
the benefit of their contributions.

The initiative would be forward looking, preparing us for a new century (and a new millennium).
 It would address the issue of race in the contemporary American context: Hispanic, Asian
American, African American, Native American, other people of color, and White.

The initiative would have several components, beginning with Presidential leadership. You
would participate personally in several town hall meetings on this issue. In addition, you would
ask fifteen distinguished Americans to serve on a Presidential commission that would work with
you. The commission would primarily focus on basic areas which are important in providing
every American the unhindered ability to pursue the American dream -- education, employment
and housing -- and also address those unique issues which affect the goal of racial reconciliation
and understanding -- youth, violence, the dynamic change in our nation's racial composition,
global economic leadership and our criminal justice system.

The commission will engage in extensive discussions around the country, find effective
interracial efforts already underway in local communities and meet with scholars who can
examine certain issues in depth. The commission will report back to you regularly on their
progress.

On January 19,1998, the federal hoJidaymarking the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., you
would receive the final report ofthe commission, including a comprehensive look at race
relations in America today and recommendations for action as we go forward.

Goals and Actions

To carry out this mission, the following goals and actions have been developed.

GOAL ONE: Frame a debate with a positive, forward-looking focus on how we think and talk
about race; strengthen Americans' appreciation of the value of diversity as one of our greatest
resources; and instill the sense of promise that One America holds.

ACTIONS:
    Use the bully pulpit of the President to articulate these themes.
    Highlight these themes in all of the commission's activities and through targeted
     amplifiers (e.g: PSAs and Cabinet involvement).
    Engage Americans on these themes through the interactive components of the initiative
     (e.g. town hall meetings, web site, etc).



                                                2
                                Hex-Dump Conversion

      Distribute literature reflecting these core themes through the commission to schools,
       businesses and community organizations.
GOAL TWO: Raise the profile of racial reconciliation and understanding, to a degree previously
reached only in times of trouble.

ACTIONS:
    Introduce the initiative in a major Presidential address.
    Elevate the initiative nationally through your participation in town hall meetings, regular
     meetings with the commissioners and possibly a presentation of a Presidential award.
    Elevate the initiative nationally and locally through the town hall meetings, public
     hearings and policy roundtables sponsored by the commission.
    Activate Cabinet involvement with the commission and incorporate outside disciples and
     validators.
    Highlight the initiative through active involvement with the national media, through
     public service announcements and other ways.

GOAL THREE: Confront and work to eliminate discrimination and promote racial
reconciliation and understanding.

ACTIONS:
    Survey local and community groups for ideas on best practices involving these issues.
    Serve as a clearing house to distribute best practices to a wider range of community and
     governmental bodies (e.g. ministerial groups, U.S. Conference on Mayors, National
     League of Cities and National Governors' Association)
    Highlight, analyze and develop strategies for overcoming common stereotypes and
     discriminatory acts through town hall meetings, public hearings and report.
    Provide recommendations for actions to eliminate certain discriminatory acts.
    Spotlight those persons, groups and businesses who exemplify One America through the
     town hall meetings, public hearings, your speeches, PSAs and other means.
    Consider bestowing a Presidential award or awards upon those who best exemplify One
     America.
    Work in partnership with non-profit organizations and businesses involved in these
     efforts and encourage others to join.
    Address these issues in visits to schools and campuses and through youth-oriented media.

GOAL FOUR: Initiate ongoing constructive dialogue on racial issues between and among races,
which includes particular attention on how to maintain civil discourse on some of these divisive
issues. Foster and encourage sustaining this dialogue through the spread of organizations which
will further provide expansion of meaningful interracial dialogue.

ACTIONS:
    Establish and explain the importance of dialogue in your major speech.
    Set an example through Presidential participation in town hall meetings.

                                                3

      Issue Presidential challenge for Americans across the country to join in such a dialogue in
       their homes, schools, businesses and places of worship.
      Encourage dialogue through a wider range of community and governmental bodies (e.g.
       ministerial groups, service organizations, U.S. Conference on Mayors, National League of
       Cities and National Governors Association).
      Engage students at schools and campuses in dialogue and create youth-oriented media
       which addresses the importance of dialogue.

GOAL FIVE: Foster a greater understanding among the American people of the many ways in
which our racial backgrounds affect perceptions oflife and events, and with that understanding,
arrive at a better appreciation for the views of people of different races.

      Highlight common perceptions held by groups about themselves and others at town hall
       meetings and public hearings.
      Deliver insightful, accurate information that addresses those perceptions.

     relations in the U.S. through in-put from town hall meetings, hearings and other
     fact-finding.
    Study and analyze the changing demographics of the U.S. through the first fifty years of
     the 21 st Century.

GOAL SEVEN Provide concrete, specific recommendations on how to derive strength from
this country's dynamic racial composition.

ACTIONS:
    Build a consensus locally and nationally that is committed to implementing the
     commission's recommendations.
    Distribute and encourage specific action items for the American people that private

Commission

Charter: The commission would be charged with implementing the mission of the President's
initiative by carrying out the action items. Through these efforts, the commission would help
lead all Americans towards One America by bringing the races together through dialogue and
education, and it would raise and answer the tough questions facing an America with a dynamic
and diverse population. In the commission's report, it would make concrete recommendations
for action by individuals, businesses, churches, schools and govemment at all levels.

Membership: The commission would be composed of approximately fifteen members. The
commission would consist of distinguished Americans who transcend race and politics and who
embody the vision of One America. They will be diverse professionally and racially. (The
attached memo and lists ofprospective commissioners are for your consideration and selection.)

Executive Director I Staff: An executive director and deputy director would head the
commission, and be responsible for managing the commission's work. (The attached list
provides suggestions on potential executive directors for your consideration.) They would be
assisted by a full-time staff of about 30 professional and support employees. Also, various
consultants and contractors will be hired to supplement the full-time staff. The commission
would be housed in space outside the White House. Among other duties, the commission staff
will carry out the following functions:

      support the commission members in their deliberations
      help to develop and oversee the commission's research agenda
      schedule and arrange commission meetings and hearings
      oversee the preparation of working papers and a final report
      serve as a point of contact for the press and others who are interested in the commission's
       work
      serve as a liaison between the commission and the White House and Executive Branch
      reach out to the public along with the commissioners

(For the Kerner Commission, President Johnson appointed David Ginsburg to be executive
director and Victor H. Palmer as deputy executive director. They divided the commission's
work into two phases. In the first phase, it held 20 days of public hearings between August and
November 1967. More than 130 individuals from federal, state and local government, including
leaders from the civil rights, labor, religious, and business community testified. Ninety
professional and clerical workers supported this phase. The second phase, which extended from
December 1967 to February 1968, involved reviewing the information collected from its
extensive research program (e.g., they developed riot profiles on 23 cities) and drafting its final

report. A professional staff of 45 professionals and clerical staff supported this phase of the
work.)




Town Hall Meetings

In early June, you would kick off the commission's town hall meetings by hosting the first one.
This meeting would focus on promoting the commission's goal of encouraging dialogue and
preparing a road map for the 21 st Century. It would provide a forum for you to emphasize the
positive, forward-looking aspects of the commission and challenge the country to actively engage
the commission and each other.

After this initial town hall meeting, the commission would hold a series of others in cities and
rural areas around the country. You would attend two or three more meetings throughout the
year. The Vice President and First Lady could also participate in town hall meetings. At these
town hall meetings, commission members could encourage local officials to have preparatory,
parallel and/or follow-up sessions on their own to try to agree on, or at least identify, key
problems and solutions. These town hall meetings would focus on engaging and challenging the
American people to discuss how we can move forward in specific areas (e.g. employment in
Detroit, Michigan; education in rural south; criminal justice system in Los Angeles, California;
housing in Chicago, Illinois or Santa Fe, New Mexico. These locations and topics are illustrative
only.) The participants would consist of mostly people from the community. The town hall
meetings could be policy road tests where communities can provide feedback on potential policy
outcomes.

Commission Meetings at White House

Over the course of the commission, the commissioners would come to the White House every
other month to meet with you. At these meetings, they would brief you on their experiences and
progress.

Report

On January 19,1998, the federal holiday marking Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday, the
commission would deliver their report to you. The report would layout a vision of the 21 st
Century. It would teach and challenge the American people. The report would reflect their
outreach to thousands of Americans through town hall meetings, interviews and the nation's best
minds on this subject. It would include a review existing research and include that of the
independent, bi-partisan u.S. Commission on Civil Rights. It would recommend specific
concrete actions that we must take on the national and local levels to achieve this vision. This
report could be a living document that educates the nation, frames the debate and provides
concrete solutions for a long time to come.

RECOMMENDATION

After considering different formats for pursuing your call to the American people, we
recommend that you appoint a commission that will work on improving race relations, do a
series oftown hall meetings with the commission, and meet with the commissioners at the White
House once every two months.

This option is not without drawbacks. There is the chance that the commission would
recommend that we spend more money on problems despite our serious budget constraints.
Also, there is a possibility that the commission will offer recommendations contrary to your
policy (e.g. They recommend against educational standards.) Additionally, meeting with the
commissioners at the White House is a great device for forcing the commission's work along and
giving you some ownership, but it also makes it difficult to distance you from the deliberations
and conclusions of the commission.
