Attached are two auto choice proposals.  One has been prepared by CEA.
This proposal would encourage less driving and thus lower insurance rates,
less emissions, and less accidents.  However, it has many downsides as
well, including greater government involvement in insurance and driving
practices. Also attached is a summary and analysis of the McConnell/Armey
Auto Choice bill.  We are also pursuing a fraud option with the Justice
Department.

                                       AUTO CHOICE

A bipartisan coalition of Senators has introduce a proposal for auto-insurance reform called 'Auto
Choice.'

      Under this proposal, drivers in states who accept the new federal legislation have a choice
       between the existing system in their state and a strict no-fault plan (called 'personal
       protection insurance' (PPI) ).

      A driver who chooses the PPI option gets first-party coverage for economic damages
       (mostly medical and lost wages), without regard to fault; a PPI driver can sue or be sued
       for economic damages above policy limits. PPI drivers cannot sue or be sued for
       non-economic damages ('pain and suffering'), although exceptions are made for accidents
       involving drug or alcohol abuse.

      A driver who opts to stay in the state's current tort system must purchase tort maintenance
       coverage (TMC) to cover accidents with PPI drivers.

Pros

    Reductions in premiums for PPJ drivers. Drivers who choose the PPJ option will see
    dramatically lower premiums. Premium savings come both from the reduction of substantial,
    unnecessary transaction costs such as lawyers fees and the elimination of pay-outs for pain
    and suffering. Premium reductions are estimated by the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) to
    be 32 of total auto insurance premiums ($45 billion), if everyone chooses the PPI option.
    About one-fifth of the premium reduction comes from reductions in transaction costs; the vast
    bulk of the premium reduction comes from the cessation of payments for pain and suffering.

    Speedier processing of claims for PPJ drivers. PPI drivers will also have their claims processed
    faster under their first-party coverage than under the current third-party coverage.

    Benefits for low-income PPJ drivers. Low-income drivers who elect the PPI option will
    particularly benefit. The tort system works to the disadvantage of lower income drivers who
    are less likely to be able to afford to wait out costly litigation and who - with third party
    payers - must insure against the potential losses of other drivers who have higher incomes
    and hence higher economic losses (lost wages).

   Could reduce the number of uninsured motorists. With the reduced premiums offered by PPI,
    some motorists who chose not to insure in a tort system may now be willing to purchase
    insurance.

                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
    benefits of no-fault insurance while avoiding the political unpopularity of denying drivers
    their tort rights. Furthermore, the plan allows states the option to opt out of Auto Choice, in
    order to alleviate some of the federal-state issues.

Cons

   More accidents, pollution, and congestion. The reduction in premiums for those who choose
    no-fault will result in more drivers on the road. More driving means more accidents,
    pollution and congestion. In addition, reduced liability for negligence may result in less
    careful driving.

   Premiums for safe TMC drivers may increase. A TMC driver's liability is reduced since PPI
    drivers whom they hit cannot sue them. However, TMC drivers must now insure their own
    economic and non-economic damages if they are not at fault and are hit by a PPI driver.
    Therefore in a competitive insurance market, safe TMC drivers would see their premiums
    increase under Auto Choice; because safe drivers are by definition at fault less than 50 percent
    of the time, their reduction in premiums because in accidents in which they are at fault they
    do not have to compensate PPI drivers' economic and non-economic losses does not offset
    their increase in premiums from needing to now cover their own economic and
    non-economic losses when they are not at fault. This increase in TMC premiums for safe
    drivers would occur even if safe and bad drivers were randomly assigned to the two policy
    options. State regulation could in principle prevent the premium rise for safe TMC drivers,
    but it is not clear that current regulatiol)s in Choice states do this. The fEC assertion that
    drivers who elect TMC will not see their premiums rise is thus highly suspect

   Will there be a real choice? In a competitive market, premiums for bad drivers who switch to
    PPI will fall more than premiums for good drivers who switch. The resulting self-selection of
    bad drivers into PPI will exaccerbate the above problem of rising TMC rates for safe drivers.
    As'TMC premiums rise, more people will switch to PPI, thus further raising TMC
    premiums, These increases in TMC premiums could effectively remove any real 'choice'
    between the two systems. However, in the three states that currently offer Choice, state
    regulation prevents the competitive rate setting that would produce this self selection and
    hence 'choice' may be preserved,

   Federal/state issues. Even though the Auto Choice law allows states to opt out, it
    nevertheless represents Federal involvement in an area that up until now has been left to the
    states.
                    Auto Choice and Per-Mile Premiums

Per-mile premiums plus Auto Choice package would save money AND
increase safety

         By itself, Auto Choice would save $ but could compromise safety

         Per-mile premiums plus Auto Choice will save lives and save more $

         Drivers will choose, if offered the package, to leave tort system to save $


Per-mile premiums could save thousands of lives per year

         Linking premiums closely to miles driven will reduce driving and hence
          accidents

Potential $20 billion in premium savings under per-mile plan in addition to
$45 billion in Auto Choice savings

         Initially insurance companies would set per-mile premiums to keep total
          premium constant, assuming driving patterns are unchanged

         Premiums would fall as people drive less and accident costs fall

         Premiums would fall for the vast majority of drivers; only those who drive more
          than twice as much as the average driver in their insurance pool (e.g. similar age,
          experience, part of country, etc.) would potentially see higher rates

Huge incidental benefits

         Reduced traffic congestion from fewer miles driven AND fewer accidents

         Reduced smog and health-harming pollutants from fewer miles AND less
          congestion

         Reduced emissions of greenhouse gases from fewer miles implies LOWER
          ABATEMENT COSTS. Carbon emissions would fall by about 5% of the 2010
          baseline.
                      Auto Choice and Per-Mile Premiums
                    Aaron Edlin with Amy Finkelstein and Mark Rainey


The Proposal:

        Amend the Auto Choice plan so that in states that don't opt out, if a driver chooses no-
fault her premium is quoted on a per-mile-driven basis. As under Auto Choice, drivers could opt
to keep current insurance coverage instead.
        Per-mile premiums could be charged based upon an estimate of miles, with a rebate or
surcharge issued every year or two after an odometer reading. Odometers could be read at
existing emissions or safety checks or by firms under contract with insurance companies.
        Insurance companies would compete in their per-mile premium, subject to current
regulations; premiums would consequently vary with region, driving record, type of car, and
safety features, much as premiums vary now.

The Pack~ge Advantage: Saving Costs without Risking Safety.

        Auto Choice could reduce premiums by 32%, according to the Joint Economic
Committee. Many argue, however, that no-fault would increase drivers' carelessness and make
driving more dangerous. One recent empirical study suggests that if everyone chose no-fault,
there would be thousands of extra fatalities each year.

By packaging Auto Choice with a per-mile premium, however, safety should increase and
premiums should fall still further. The reason is that a per-mile premium discourages driving.

Huge incidental benefits include reduced traffic congestion (from fewer miles driven and fewer
accidents) and reduced smog and other health-harming pollutants (from fewer miles and less
congestion). Rcduced emissions of greenhouse gases from fewer miles implies lower abatement
costs to achieve Kyoto agreement. Carbon emissions would fall by about 5 percent of baseline
2010 emissions under our package plan; they would rise under the current Auto Choice proposal.


Per-Mile Premiums could save 9,000 lives per year.

         A fundamental problem with current auto insurance systems is that insured drivers face
too little of the accident costs associated with the amount of driving they do. Accidents increase
the more miles people drive. Insurance rates take this into account somewhat, but the connection'
is far too weak for two reasons:
         Insurance firms typically have coarse mileage group'ings---e.g. one rate for over 6000
     miles and one for under 6000 miles/year. Odometers are rarely checked and under self-
     reporting, fraud and mistaken estimates of yearly mileage are big problems. Experience
     rating helps somewhat, but to a very limited extent. (If the cost of insurance rose for extra
     accidents by the cost of accidents, insurance would be a loan, not insurance.)


                                                2
        Furthermore, a driver's own insurance company does not face the full accident cost of the
    driver driving an extra mile: safe drivers, who are not at fault in accidents, cost their own
    insurance company little because the other driver's insurance company typically pays the
    accident costs. Yet, even safe drivers create a substantial social cost simply by being on the
    road because they are another potential target or obstacle for bad drivers.
As a result, drivers do not actually face and certainly do not perceive the true cost of driving an
extra mile. Drivers consequently drive too many miles.
    This problem is alleviated if mileage is verified every year or two and insurance premiums
are proportionate to miles driven. Initially, per-mile premiums would probably be approximately
4 cents per mile. Although this would not increase the total cost of driving (since it would
simply substitute for current premiums), it would increase, the cost of driving an extra mile
substantially. The increase in the marginal cost of driving would be roughly equivalent to an 80
percent increase in the retail price of gasoline! We might therefore expect miles driven to fall by
roughly 16 percent, conservatively taking the low end ofresults from studies of the
responsiveness of miles driven to the price of gasoline. Roughly 9,000 lives could be saved per-
year under a mileage based premium system.

Potential $20 billion in savings on premiums from Per-Mile Premiums in addition to Auto
Choice Savings of $ 45 billion

    Insurance companies would set per-mile premiums in a competitive process subject to current
regulations. Initially per-mile premiums would probably be set so that total premiums cover total
accident costs, assuming that driving patterns remain unchanged. Total insurance premiums
would quickly fall, however, because accident costs will fall as drivers drive less. A rough
estimate of the fall in total premiums is 22% or $21 billion, in addition to the fall of $45 billion
from Auto Choice.

A large pool of winners: savings for almost all drivers

    Per-mile premiums would undoubtedly be set to vary with a driver's age, the region of the
country, urban vs. suburban, driving record, car model, safety features, just as under the current
insurance system. Competition would demand such market segmentation. Hence safe drivers,
for example, would face lower per-mile rates, and hence lower total insurance costs, than bad
drivers, just as they do under the current system.

    And even though in some regions rural drivers drive much more than urban drivers, total
insurance costs for these rural drivers would fall by the same proportion that urban drivers' total
costs would fall. This is because insurance companies currently set rural drivers' rates to reflect
both that they drive a lot more than urban drivers and that their chance of having an accident per
mile driven is smaller than for an urban driver. With per-mile premiums, the insurance
companies would no longer have to increase rural premiums to reflect their greater mileage; but
they would set rural per-mile premiums lower than urban per-mile premiums to account for the
former's lower per-mile accident rate. As a result, a typical rural driver and a typical urban driver
would benefit equally from the package proposal.

    Although total premiums would fall dramatically on average for a pool of drivers with a
given risk profile, some very high-mileage drivers in a pool might pay higher accident rates.
Drivers who drive more than twice the average mileage of drivers with their risk profile might
face higher premiums. For example, although most rural drivers would see their insurance
premiums plummet, a rural driver who drove over twice the average distance that a rural driver
drives per year could see a rate increase. The same applies to very high-mileage urban drivers,
safe drivers, bad drivers, etc.

Huge Incidental Benefits of Per-Mile Premiums

A 16% fall in vehicle miles would yield:

    Abatementcost savings. The reduction in driving will reduce emissions of greenhouse
gases substantially. This will save large abatement costs that would otherwise be incurred to
meet the Kyoto agreement. Carbon emissions, for example, would fall by about 5% of baseline
2010 emissions. If marginal abatement costs were $1 OO/ton, abatement cost savings would be
over $8.5 billion.

    Less smog and other pollution. Fewer miles would lead to a nationwide reduction in
emissions of NO x, a greenhouse gas that also contributes to smog and particulate pollution. In
major metropolitan areas, NO x emissions might fall by one-seventh of the amount needed to
attain EPA's recently promUlgated ozone air quality standard. These reductions in NO x emissions
from per-mile premiums could exceed the reductions that would result from all the controls
identified by EPA in the analysis in support of its recent ozone air quality standard.

    Less traffic congestion. Fewer miles implies less traffic congestion, because of less
crowding. Reduced accidents will further alleviate congestion. The reduction in congestion-
related travel delays in major metropolitan areas would be substantial. For example, in the San
Francisco Bay area, and in the Los Angeles area, such delays per driver per year would fall by
approximately 30 percent (20 and 23 hours respectively).

    Better than gas taxes. Raising gas taxes to address these environmental issues raises the
total cost of driving. But the per-mile premium package addresses the same issues while lowering
the total cost of driving.

Linking Auto Choice with Per-mile Premiums to redress Auto-Choice's problem.

   States and individuals that opt into Auto Choice create a hazard for others. Per-mile
premiums offset this hazard, and so they should be required for those who choose no-fault.
Possibly, this linkage should be waived for states that already have no-fault, if this compromise is
necessary to gain political support.

   Linking the no-fault choice with per-mile premiums would give us the best of both worlds.
Lives could be saved, not lost, and the total insurance cost of driving would fall on average by
over 20% more than it would under Auto Choice alone.


CHOICE is central to this package proposal, as it is to Auto Choice

    It is important to keep in mind that states can choose whether to opt into the package of Auto
Choice and per-mile premiums or to keep their tort and insurance system as it is.
    If a state opts in, drivers can choose whether to keep their current insurance or switch to the
new package. Those who choose the keep their current insurance would not face per-mile
premiums.
    Drivers will also choose whether to keep driving their current amounts or reduce their
driving. Unlike current gas taxes, per-mile premiums do not increase the total cost of driving. In
fact, because of the savings from no-fault, total premiums should fall immediately, even if
driving miles stayed constant. Furthermore, people will CHOOSE to reduce miles to save even
more on premiums. The great feature is that one person's choice to reduce miles will actually
reduce the per-mile charge for others!

Implementation.

    A mileage-based premium system could be easily implemented. Insurance compani"es could
simply read a car's odometer once every year or two. Alternatively, odometers could be read
during existing emission or safety checks. Per-mile premiums could be charged based upon an
estimate of miles, with a rebate or surcharge issued every year or two after an odometer reading.

        It is difficult to be sure whether insurance fraud would increase or decrease under per-
mile premiums. Currently, there is undoubtedly significant misreporting given that some
insurance companies will cut premiums 15 percent for customers who claim to drive less than
7500 miles per year. Under a per-mile system, where odometers were checked, there would
likewise be an incentive to tamper with odometers. Tampering with odometers is not, however, a
trivial matter that the typical person can do for herself. Moreover, it is a crime, and probably not
the easiest or safest way to steal a few hundred dollars a year.

    For the vast majority of Americans, odometers are tamper-proof. Although everyone selling a
used car already has a substantial financial incentives to set back the odometer (setting back the
odometer 30,000 miles typically increases value by $2,100), odometer fraud today occurs mostly
in the wholesale used car business. Therefore, it is currently difficult for someone who might
want to adjust his odometer to find someone who can do it. There is also a significant risk
involved in such tampering. For example, whenever a franchised dealer services a vehicle
manufactured by the company granting the franchise, a computerized record is made which
includes the vehicle's mileage. Companies currently exist that use this and other sources to
collect motor vehicle histories and sell them to prospective purchasers; these companies could
similarly sell the histories to insurance companies to deter odometer tampering.

    There are already large incentives to tamper with odometers to increase the value of a used
car. The resale value of a used car may decline by as much as 7 cents per mile, whereas average
per-mile premiums under the package plan would be about 4 cents per mile.

         Odometer fraud is significantly more difficult than changing ones own oil. As an
illustrative calculation, suppose that 20 percent of people currently change their own car oil, and
suppose that 10 percent of these people would set their odometers back. If these people reduced
their miles in half, this would raise premiums for everyone else by approximately one percent,
much less than per-mile premiums are apt to save from accident reduction. Fear of insurance
fraud is not a good reason to oppose per-mile premiums.


Maintaining existing insurance markets. Unlike Pay-at-the-Pump, per-mile premiums do not
interfere with the free and competitive operation of insurance markets. Insurance companies
would continue to compete for business in the same way under this package.proposal. Per-mile
premiums therefore do not raise the specter of increased government interference in insurance
markets. Additionally, a per-mile charge would vary with the quality of the driver, which affects
accidents, not with fuel efficiency, which does not. Insurance companies could continue to adjust
insurance premiums for any characteristics of the driver or the car that they currently use to
calculate expected accident costs; per-mile premiums would vary in the same way that fixed
premiums currently do.

Why don't insurance companies already use per-mile premiums?

    Externality. One reason insurance companies do not already use per-mile premiums is that
many of the benefits from a per-mile charge are not realized by the driver or her insurance
company, but are realized by other drivers and other insurance companies. The reason is that
part of the cost of accidents that extra miles cause are borne by other drivers and their insurance
companies. Keep in mind that even a safe driver causes accidents by being an extra target that
bad drivers can hit. For this reason accident reductions are more than proportionate to the
percentage reduction in miles. Driving is much like entering an obstacle course. The fewer times
you enter, the fewer total obstacles you will hit. If the obstacle course were held constant as
driving is reduced, then we would expect a roughly proportionate reduction in accidents. But
there are fewer obstacles when there are fewer miles driven, so the per-mile collision rate will
also fall!


    Adverse Selection. Another reason insurance companies don't already offer per-mile
premiums is that if a company offers a per-mile package under the current system (without the
cost savings from Auto Choice), this option would only be chosen by low mileage drivers, or by
the few drivers who manage tQ tamper with their odometers. If the per-mile price is set to break
even given present per-mile accident costs, insurance companies would lose money. Two
reasons: first, fraud by the few who tamper with odometers; second, although drivers who drive
low miles have lower total accident costs, they may have somewhat higher per-mile costs,
because they have less driving experience. Therefore, to break even, insurance companies would
have to raise the per-mile charge. As they did so, however, the adverse selection would get
worse: only odometer-tampering drivers and very 'low mile drivers would remain. Breaking
even would therefore require a still-higher charge, leading to a still smaller and adversely
selected group of buyers. Ultimately, the market may be too small to be viable or disappear
entirely.

    CostlHassle. A final reason that some companies may not have switched is that it seems like
a costly hassle to check odometers. The hassle will be reduced, however, if many companies in a
state switch to per-mile at once. Then, a single facility could check odometers for all insurance
companies. Perhaps it could be done when emissions or vehicle safety is checked.
