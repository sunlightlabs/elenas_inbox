           Questions and Answers on Tentative Agreement on National Tests
                                 ,November 7, 1997


Q:   Earlier the Administration had indicated the President would veto this bill if it
     required further authorization from Congress to move forward with testing. But
     some suggest that this compromise basically kills the national test to clear the way
     for Fast Track. Has the President given up on a national test?,

A:   Absolutely not. The agreement allows us to proceed with development of the 4th and
     8th grade national tests that the President has proposed. It also allows us to pilot test the
     items for these tests next fall. This is a delay of a few months, but it's one we can live
     with. At the same time, we will go forward with a National Academy of Sciences study
     of ways to link state tests to each other and to NAEP, an existing national sample test,
     that reflects high national standards. Both aspects of the agreement make progress
     toward a single goal: ensuring that all students, across the country, are measured by the
     same high standards.


Q:   The legislation looks like a victory for test opponents. What did the Administration
     get out of this agreement?

A:   This agreement is a solid victory for high standards. Under the compromise, the final
     appropriations bill drops the general prohibition on national tests contained in the
     House-passed bill, which the Administration threatened to veto, and allows us to proceed
     with development of the 4th grade reading and 8th grade math tests. The bill shifts
     control over test policies and development to the independent, bipartisan, National
     Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), as the Administration had proposed. It provides
     $16 million dollars to support the testing plan. And it allows for pilot testing oftest
     items to begin next fall. At the same time, the bill provides for a potentially valuable
     study of ways to link state tests to each other and to NAEP, an existing national sample
     test, that reflects high national standards. This agreement puts us on the road to high
     national standards, and to measuring whether these standards are being met. We will
     finally have high expectations for all our students and real accountability for all our
     schools.


Q:   Is further development of the national tests dependent on the fmdings of the
     National Academy of Sciences study? What is the timeline for this study?

A:   The Academy will be asked to make an interim report by June 15, 1998 with a final report
     submitted by Sept. 1. Further development of the national tests is not contingent on the
     findings of the NAS study. NAGB can goforward with test development activities
     leading up to pilot testing right now. Pilot testing is postponed until after September 30,
     but does not depend on the completion or findings of the National Academy study.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

Q:   Does the compromise require further authorization to move beyond the pilot testing
     stage?

A:   The compromise allows for test development in FY 98, and pilot testing after September
     30. It is silent on the subject of further congressional action.
                               Q&A on Pilot Testing Date
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


Q:   It sounds as if the Administration and Hill negotiators spent aU day yesterday
     haggling over two dates: September 1 and September 30. What was at stake and
     were you satisfied with the resolution?

A:   We had an agreement with Mr. Goodling to allow pilot testing to begin September 1.
     Mr. Goodling changed the date to September 30, but after reviewing the legislative
     language, we detennined that this would not interfere with our plans in any way, because
     as a practical matter we would not have begun pilot testing in the first few weeks of the
     school year.
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
              Talking Points on Tentative Agreement on National Tests
                                 November 7, 1997

   This is a win-win agreement -- a genuine bipartisan victory for high standards.

   The agreement allows continued, timely development of new national tests in 4th grade
    reading and 8th grade math, as called for by the President in his State of the Union
    Address. As provided for by the Senate, control of test policies and development will be
    transferred to the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB).

   At the same time, the National Academy of Sciences, in consultation with NGA, NCSL,
    and NAGB, will study how tests already developed by commercial publishers and states
    may be used to measure student performance against each other and against national
    standards. In addition, the Academy will study the technical quality and other aspects of
    test item development.

   The Academy will be asked to make an interim report by June 15, 1998 with a final report
    submitted by September 1. Further development of the national tests is not dependent on
    the findings of the NAS study. NAGB can goforward with test development activities
    leading up to pilot testing right now. Pilot testing is postponed until after September 30,
    1998, but does not depend on the completion or findings of the National Academy study.
    This timeline represents a delay of a few months, but it's one we can live with.

   The agreement allows for test development in FY 98, and pilot testing after September
    30. It drops the general prohibition on national tests that the Administration threatened
    to veto, and does not include any requirement for congressional authorization to proceed
    with national tests.

   As a result of this agreement, we are now on the road to high national standards, and to
    measuring whether these standards are being met. We will finally have high expectations
    for all our students and real accountability for all our schools.
