                Improvements to the Senate Juvenile Crime Legislation

   Three out of four "core mandates" preserved. Senator Hatch's bill originally
    weakened all of the core protections for juveniles in state custody. The bill that cleared
    the Senate today preserves language in current law ensuring that juveniles are separated
    by sight and sound from adults while incarcerated; that they are not placed in adult jails;
    and that status offenders are not incarcerated. However, the bill does re-write
    protections against disproportionate minority confinement. A Kennedy/Wellstone
    amendment to drop this provision was defeated, and this issue will have to be revisited in
    conference.

   Guaranteed prevention funds. The original Hatch bill provided almost no funds for
    prevention. The bill that passed today sets aside 25 percent of the $450 million Juvenile
    Accountability Block Grant for prevention, and authorizes a separate $435 million for
    other delinquency and prevention programs.

   No new death penalties. The original Hatch bill made 16-year olds eligible for the
    federal death penalty. This provision has been dropped.

   No provisions to transfer juveniles to adult facilities. The new juvenile crime bill
    does not include provisions considered last year to allow the Justice Department's Bureau
    of Prisons to transfer certain 16-year Olds to adult facilities.

   Allows federal prosecutors limited discretion to try violent juveniles as adults. The
    new juvenile crime bill allows federal prosecutors -- not judges -- to make the initial
    decision as to whether certain violent juveniles and gang members should be tried as
    adults.

   Onerous conditions on states deleted. To be eligible for the new block grant funds, the
    original Hatch bill required states to pass new laws to prosecute juveniles (14-year olds)
    as adults. These hard requirements have been dropped and replaced with more
    reasonable conditions requiring graduated sanctions, drug testing and protection of
    victims rights in cases involving juvenile offenders.

   Federalization clause dropped. The original Hatch bill included a presumption that all
    juvenile crime should be federal and then referred to states as appropriate. Chief Justice
    Rehnquist complained bitterly last year about this provision, and it is no longer in the bill.

   New gun provisions. The original Hatch bill contained no provision to address gun
    violence. As you know, the new bill: (1) requires background checks for all gun sales at
    gun shows; (2) requires gun dealers to provide child safety locks with every handgun
    sold; (3) bans the juvenile possession of assault weapons and large capacity clips; (4)
    expands the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative; (5) bans the importation oflarge
    capacity ammunition clips; (6) prohibits violent juveniles from possessing guns (but in a
    weaker fonn than your own proposal); and (7) provides $50 million for the increased
                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
