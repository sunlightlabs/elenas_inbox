1.   I have attached a draft one-pager on the announcement for your
review.   Once I have your revisions and comments, I will submit it to
press.   I'm giving the draft to Christa to take to the event meeting at
2:00pm.

2.  FCC Letter:  Dennis told me you have the final draft.    Did Kathy
Wallman get it cleared though Staff Secretary when she circulated it? Let
me know if anything needs to be done on this front.

3 . Q 's and A' s :  I am still working on these.  I will shm'l it to you when

suggestions.

                  Clinton Administration Urges FCC to Investigate
                         Hard Liquor Ads on TV and Radio
                                          April 1, 1997

Announcement:
     Today, President Clinton announced that he was writing to Federal Communications
     Commission (FCC) Chairman Reed Hundt to"take all appropriate action" to explore what
     effects might ensue from the distilled liquor industries decision to end their 50-year
     voluntary ban on broadcast advertising.

Background:
     In November 1996, the Distilled Spirits Council announced that it had ended its almost
      50-year voluntary practice of refraining from broadcast advertising.

      Although the major networks and cable companies have thus far refused to accept
       distilled spirits advertising, a few companies have run some liquor ads on television and
       radio since the announcement and other companies are presently preparing large
       advertising campaigns.

      Chairman Hundt has opposed any move toward liquor advertising. In December, he
       challenged broadcasters to refuse liquor advertising, and indicated that "government
       action" might be appropriate if the broadcasters did not do so.

      In sending this letter, President Clinton is joining 26 members of Congress who have
       independently requested the FCC to study the effects hard liquor advertising on the
       nation's youth and to consider possible action. In addition, 11 states have joined
       Alaska's more far-reaching petition for a FCC rulemaking to ban the TV and radio
       advertising of distilled spirits.

      As Chairman Hundt has stated, an FCC inquiry can supply the information needed to
       evaluate the nature and extent of the problem posed by broadcast liquor ads, and the
       proper course of action.

Alcohol Use by Youth
     Alcohol is the drug most often used by young people. Approximately one in four 10th
      grade students and one-third of 12th graders report having had five or more drinks on at
      least one occasion in the last two weeks.

Clinton Administration: Reducing Youth Alcohol and Tobacco Use
      The President has pushed states to adopt a policy of zero-tolerance for teen drinking and
       driving or risk losing Federal highway funds.

      The Clinton Administration has taken tough, unprecedented action to fight tobacco
       marketing that targets teens by imposing appropriate regulations on the sale and
       distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco advertising that appeals to adolescents.
