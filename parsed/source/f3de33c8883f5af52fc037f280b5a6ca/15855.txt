        I think Ken's right that the WH/OMB staff working on food stamps (Martha
        Foley and Lisa Kountoupes) could use these talking points.   please review
        the attached -- the first page is what we prepared for Erskine with a new
        bullet at the end. The second page is new.    Since the House Ag markup is
        expected to be tomorrow, I'd like to distribute these by COB today.
        Thanks.

        We'll add this to the letter.   Also, would it be possible for dpc to do
        up a few talkers on why we oppose the stenholm amendment? Martha, Lisa
        and others who have not been involved with this issue need something to
        talk from.

                                            Food Stamp Privatization
                                                    6/11/97


           Talking Points

                The welfare refonn bill passed by the Congress and signed by the President allowed states
                 to privatize their cash assistance programs, but did not change the law for Medicaid or
                 food stamps.

                The President believes states need flexibility to make welfare what it was meant to be: a
                 second chance, not a way of life, a system that helps people draw a paycheck instead of a
                 welfare check. That's why he signed the welfare refonn law last year in the face of much
                 opposition from many in his party.

                We're concerned that allowing a state to privatize Medicaid and food stamp operations
                 will not be in the best interests of program beneficiaries.

                Current Medicaid and food stamp law makes clear that eligibility detennination must be
                 perfonned by impartial, merit-based public employees.

                We offered the state of Texas the chance to conduct a sub-state demonstration of
                 privatization, but the state declined.

                The letter we sent Texas in May allows the state to proceed with contracting out for a
                 statewide computer system to do integrated enrollment. The state is also free to privatize
                 its welfare (i.e., T ANF) operations.

                Now, amendments may be offered in the House that would allow states to either
                 completely privatize welfare operations [likely GOP amendment] or to partially privatize
                 food stamp operations [likely Stenholm amendment]. We oppose these amendments for
                 the same reason that we opposed the original Texas proposal -- we are concerned about
                 the effects these proposals may have on program beneficiaries.

           Comparison of the Stenholm Amendment with the original Texas Proposal


         Congressman Stenholm's amendment would not go as far as the original Texas proposal.
 The state of Texas wanted to create a state-wide system of offices, run by a private contractor,
where residents would apply for Medicaid, food stamps, welfare, and other public assistance.
The exact nature of this system would depend on the terms of the agreement between Texas and
the contractor, but could include having private employees making the determination of
eligibility and gathering information used in such eligibility determinations.

      On May 13th, HHS sent guidance to the state of Texas which said that in the food stamps
and Medicaid programs:

               A non-public employee may not take actions involving discretion or value
                judgments, including all elements of the benefit eligibility determination process
                that relate to the evaluation of information provided by an applicant or which
                bears on the eligibility decision.

              In an integrated enrollment system, most if not all activities involving personal
               contact with an applicant or recipient, including data entry during an interactive
               discussion with the applicant, have the potential to involve the use of discretion or
               judgment and must be performed by state merit system employees.

       Stenholm's plan would allow Texas to use private contractors to obtain information from
applicants and assist them in completing their applications for benefits. However, the
determination of eligibility would be conducted by public sector employees.



                                            Texas             Stenholm     Administration
 Allows Private Contractors to:            Proposal           Proposal       Position


     Obtain Information from                  Yes                Yes             No
     Individuals used in

     Eligibility

      Determine Eligibility                   Yes                No              No



Stenholm's proposal also provides for approval of any contract by the Secretary of Agriculture
and the state legislature, which was not part of the state of Texas' proposal.
