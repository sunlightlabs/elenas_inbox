TEXT:
Attached is the Treasury/Postal Appropriations letter for your review.
House Committee markup is tomorrow, Wednesday (6/17) at 9:30am; therefore,
please provide comments by 8:50am tomorrow. Thank you.

The Honorable Bob Livingston
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's
views on the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Subcommittee. As
the Committee develops its version of the bill, your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.  These views are based on
incomplete information and are, therefore, necessarily preliminary.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Subcommittee to
accommodate the PresidentD,s priorities within the 302(b) allocation.
However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary
investments in programs funded by this bill.  As a result, a variety of
critical programs discussed below are underfunded.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to
offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.  The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending.
In the recently enacted Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad,
bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface
transportation programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We encourage the


Congress to take advantage of such additional offsets, or to reduce
appropriations for programs or projects not requested by the President.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Subcommittee-reported bill. We look forward to working with you to
resolve these concerns as the bill moves forward.

Year 2000 Computer Conversion

        The Administration appreciates the emphasis that the Subcommittee
has placed on year 2000 (Y2K) computer conversion activities. While we
support the funding mechanism established in the Act, we have some
concerns regarding the mechanism for, and allocation of, resources to
address the Y2K issue.  In the FY 1999 Budget, the. President has requested
more than $1 billion for Y2K computer conversion.   In addition, the Budget
anticipated that additional requirements would emerge over the course of
the year, and included an allowance in Function 920 for emergencies and
other unanticipated needs.   At this time, we believe that the resource
levels included in the PresidentD,s Budget will fully address Y2K computer
conversion requirements government-wide. However, as we learn more about
how to address this problem, we expect that ensuring Government-wide
compliance will require flexibility to respond to unanticipated
requirements. This mechanism provides such flexibility.    As action on the
various appropriations bills proceeds, we urge Congress to leave as much
as possible of the $2.25 billion contingent reserve unallocated so that
funds are available to address emerging needs.

        Further, we urge Congress to refrain from allocating contingency funds
for needs that are not related to Y2K computer compliance.  For example,
it appears that the funding level assumed for IRSD, use of the proposed
Y2K emergency contingent appropriation includes at least $22 million for
computer systems needs that are not Y2K-related. We believe that these
funds should be provided in the regular appropriation.

        The Administration has concerns about Subcommittee Report language
that would impose Y2K reporting requirements beyond those already in
place. While we appreciate the Committee's intent, such reporting
requirements could divert resources and management attention that would
more appropriately be focused on achieving compliance.  In addition, the
Administration objects to report language that would authorize the Chair
of the President's Council on Year 2000 Computer Conversion to "directly
access and take control of" certain agency systems. We believe that the
process now in place, whereby agency heads work in collaboration with the
Chair towards achieving compliance, is the most appropriate procedure to
ensure efficiency and accountability.

Federal Election Commission

        The Administration strongly objects to language included in the
bill that would limit the term of the Federal Election Commission's staff
director and general counsel to four years and require a vote of four
commissioners to reappoint them. This procedure is a departure from
current practice, established in statute, whereby the Commission appoints
a staff director and general counsel for an unlimited term.  As with all
Commission decisions under current practice, removal of the staff director
and general counsel requires a vote of four. commissioners. The
Administration urges the Committee to eliminate this provision from the
bill.  Furthermore, because the provision effectively could remove the
current occupants of the positions, it would raise serious constitutional
questions under the separation of power.



Executive Office of the President

        The Administration is concerned with the SubcommitteeO,s inclusion
of several provisions in the General Provisions and Executive Residence
sections of the bill and language in the Subcommittee Report.  It is our
hope that any differences that exist concerning these provisions will be
resolved as the bill moves through the process .


. Possible Amendments Related to Brady Act and Assault Weapons

        The Administration understands that there may be several
extraneous amendments offered during the full Committee markup that would
negatively impact the AdministrationO,s efforts to reduce gun crime on
AmericaO,s streets.  Such amendments would be strongly opposed by the
Administration.

Internal Revenue Service

        The Administration appreciates the SubcommitteeO,s efforts to fund
the PresidentO,s Budget request for the IRS. We look forward to working
closely with the committee and the Congress to identify ways in which the
full funding in the PresidentO,s request can be achieved.

        The Administration appreciates congressional support for IRS
information technology investments. However, tying obligation of funds to
GAO review of expenditure plans is objectionable since the Administration
has no control over the nature or timing of any prospective GAO review.

u.S. Customs Service

        The Administration is concerned about the funding level for
CustomsO, Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). Without major revisions
to the existing system, Customs cannot keep up with increasing trade
volumes nor can it be responsive to the requirements stated in the 1993
Modernization Act and the needs articulated by industry. The Subcommittee
has funded only $8 million of the requested $56 million level, which would
cause the modernization effort to come virtually to a halt. To
accommodate the full amount requested, the Administration has proposed
funding the majority of ACE requirements through a user fee paid by those
who stand to benefit most from this system, the trade community.

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms

        The Administration requests reconsideration of the Violent Crime
Coordinator initiative, as the U.S. Attorneys have requested additional
ATF support for bringing cases involving violent criminals to the
Department of Justice for prosecution.

        Relocation of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
headquarters staffing remains a key concern due to inadequate security at
the present headquarters site. We hope that the Congress will continue to
consider funding for this priority when the review process is completed.

Federal Employees Health Benefits Program

        The Administration strongly opposes sections 514 and 515 of the
bill. These provisions would restrict Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program (FEHBP) coverage for abortions except in situations where the life


of the mother is endangered or the pregnancy is the result of rape or
incest. While the President believes that abortion should be safe, legal,
and rare, the Administration does not believe that Federal employees and
their families should be precluded from choosing to purchase health
insurance that includes broader coverage. The Administration believes
that the decision to cover abortion should be left to each health plan
participating in the FEHBP. Thus, Federal employees who wish to purchase
health coverage that does not include abortion services would have that
choice. The provision in the Subcommittee bill does not allow Federal
employees and their families to make that choice.

Pay Raise

        The Administration is disappointed that the Subcommittee proposes
to eliminate the 1999 pay raise for Federal judges and employees paid
under the Executive Schedule.  Failure to provide pay raises for senior
executives is eroding the value of their pay, causing severe pay
compression in the executive ranks.  Pay adjustments have been made for
such individuals only once in the last five years.   If continued, this
failure will affect the Government's ability to attract and retain the
executive talent that it needs. We urge the Committee to restore the pay
raise for Federal judges and the Executive Schedule.

 Office of National Drug Control Policy

        The Administration appreciates the support the Subcommittee has
provided for drug control efforts in general, and for ONDCP in
particular. The Administration encourages the Committee to provide the
full amounts requested for the ONDCP Director to enhance drug control
activities and address emerging drug threats.   The Committee could fund
this spending, in part, by reducing amounts earmarked by the Subcommittee
for an unrequested technology transfer program.

Federal Buildings Fund

        The Subcommittee has not provided $1·4 ·million requested for the
design of a new Department of Transportation (DOT) Headquarters.    Instead,
the Subcommittee urges GSA to enter into a lease transaction, as
authorized by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and
the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The Administration
requests that the Committee provide funding for the design of a new DOT
Headquarters.  Providing for a government-owned building would save
taxpayers approximately $190 million, in present value. terms, compared to
the cost of entering into a lease.


        The Subcommittee bill also would   delay the availability of funding
until September 30, 1999, for the repair   and alterations program ($19
million) and building operations program   ($223 million). The
Administration is concerned that a delay   in obligations of this amount for
buildings operations would impede GSAO,s   ability to operate and maintain
Federal facilities under its control.

        We also note that the Subcommittee bill approved over $500 million
for 15 unrequested courthouse construction projects.

National Bioethics Advisory Commission

        The Administration objects to section 628 of the Subcommittee
bill, which would prevent interagency funding of the National Bioethics


Advisory Commission. The work of the Commission affects at least 15
Federal agencies.  Access to interagency funding is essential for
continued operations of this small, but important commission.

Dissemination of Public Information

        Language in the Subcommittee Report would require OMB to issue
regulations establishing detailed procedures for how Federal and
non-Federal entities (including States, grantees, and contractors)
disseminate public information.   First, the language is inappropriate in
that it would directly affect a matter that is currently under litigation
in the Federal Courts.   Second, the language would require the creation of
a complex bureaucratic process that would delay the timely release of
public information. Most agencies do an excellent job of releasing public
information -- including crop statistics, weather data, and public health
warnings. The' language would make such releases subject to a lengthy and
complex evaluation and comment process that would take resources away from
the dissemination mission. Third, because of the language's broad sweep,
the regulations to be issued would create considerable uncertainty among
non-Federal parties as to their legal responsibilities for disclosing
information.   For example, a Defense contractor would have to interpret
the applicability of the regulations issued pursuant to this language when
bidding on a contract to develop technology for the Defense Department
because the regulations could affect the winning contractor's rights in
valuable technical data (e,g., jet engine design) developed under the
contract.   Similar and potentially costly effects could apply to grantees
and States.

Competition in Commercial Activities

        The Administration understands that an amendment may be offered that
would require that all commercial work performed by Federal employees be
submitted to competition and preclude the conversion of any contracted
work to in-house performance. The Administration would oppose such an
amendment. The Administration's policy is to promote competition to
achieve the best deal to the taxpayer, not simply to out-source.' The
Government must be permitted to choose the alternative -- public or
private -- that is the most cost effective. The proposed amendment does
not acknowledge our larger reinvention effort and would mandate a
five-year schedule for conducting cost comparisons involving all
commercial work performed by Federal employees. This mandate would be ad
ministratively burdensome and could preclude agencies from considering
other management improvement efforts.

        We look forward to working with the Committee to address our
mutual concerns.

                                                Sincerely,




                                                Jacob J. Lew
                                                Acting Director
