     As Jose knows, I will be on vacation next week thinking about suspension
     of deportation over mai tais in Hawaii.  I'm attaching some documents for
     the tribal law enforcement directive and the sex offender directive-- just
     in case. The Q&A for the sex offender directive are draft. All other
     documents have been approved.

     Attached:
     1. Final Law enforcement in Indian Country Directive. Phil Caplan has
     this version.
     2. TPs on tribal law enforcement directive. Elena: this version may
     reference IS-person                     committee.
     3. Final sex offender directive. Everyone has cleared and Phil Caplan
     has this.
     4. Sex offender one-pager. Approved by Elena and Justice.
     5. Sex offender Q&A. This is draft- last question on Wetterling
     legislation should be checked.

     Hopefully, none of these will go through next week, but if I didn't email
     these to you, I'd be gu~ranteeing that they would! My hard files for
     these will be left on the chair by my door.

     Aloha and mahalo (thanks)!

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SECRETARY OF THE
INTERIOR

Subject:       Law Enforcement in Indian Country

        I am proud of this Administration's progress in reducing violent crime and improving
public safety for our Nation's citizens. Our efforts are making an important difference.
Nationwide, the violent crime rate has dropped approximately 17 percent since 1992, and the
homicide rate has declined about 22 percent.

       Unfortunately, during the same time period life has become more violent for the 1.2
million Indian citizens who live on or near reservations. Homicide rates, for example, have
increased to levels that often surpass those in large American cities. Numbers alone, however,
cannot convey the tragic impact of such violence on Indian families and their communities.

        This and other information you have provided to me make clear that we need to refocus
on this growing problem. While some tribal governments have developed strong law
enforcement programs, many others have encountered significant difficulty in doing so. Many
Indian citizens receive police, investigative, and detention services that lag far behind even this
country's poorest jurisdictions.

        The Federal government has taken steps to address this problem. The Administration
has sought increased Department of Interior funding and tribal control of law enforcement
programs on Indian lands. This year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) established an
Office of Indian Country Investigations in its Violent Crimes Section, "allocating additional
agents to Indian Country. The FBI also initiated a nationwide outreach training program for
Indian Country law enforcement officers. We have created additional tribal liaison positions in
the United States Attorney's Offices in Indian Country, intended to improve our ability to bring
offenders to justice. Through our Community Oriented Policing Services Program, we have
assisted tribal law enforcement agencies in hiring officers in Indian Country.

         Yet, law enforcement in Indian Country remains a serious problem. For these reasons,
consistent with the spirit of my 1994 memorandum on government-to-government relations and
tribal self-governance, I hereby request the Attorney General and Secretary of the Interior to work
with tribal leaders to analyze law enforcement problems on Indian lands. By October 31, 1997,
the Departments of Justice and Interior should provide options for improving public safety and
criminal justice in Indian Country. To the extent that these options might affect the
Departments' budgets, they should be included in your 1999 budget submissions and should be
consistent with the funding targets ofthe Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement.

                      Directive on Law Enforcement in Indian Country

Background
     There is a federal responsibility for law enforcement in Indian Country.
      Approximately 1.2 million Indian citizens live on lands govemed by federally recognized
      tribes. The federal government generally has jurisdiction over major crimes committed
      on Indian lands.

      There is a crisis in public safety and law enforcement in Indian Country. While
       violent crime is falling nationwide, it is rising on American Indian reservations. Since
       1992, homicides have risen over 80% in Indian Country, while decreasing by about 16%
       nationwide. The homicide rate for Indians is the highest of any ethnic group and more
       than double the rate of the white popUlation.

      Law enforcement resources in Indian Country are inadequate and have been
       dwindling. There are only half as many officers per capita in Indian Country as in the
       rest of the United States. Resources for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which funds law
       enforcement for Indian Country, have decreased since 1992. In contrast, other federal
       law enforcement agencies have received funding increases during this period.

President Clinton's Directive
      Making improved law enforcement on Indian Country a priority. The Executive
       Memorandum, which may be signed next week, directs the Attorney General and
       Secretary ofthe Interior to analyze the law enforcement problem in Indian Country and to
       submit options to the President by October 31 to improve public safety on these lands.

      Continuing Government-ta-Government Relations with tribes. In keeping with the
       President's 1994 Memorandum on government-to-government relations with tribes, the
       memorandum requests that the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior work
       with tribal leaders during the process.

      Building a consensus to solve the problem. Upon receiving the President's directive,
       the Attorney General and Interior Secretary will work with agency representatives, tribal
       leaders, and experts to develop the set of options to be submitted to the President on how
       best to address criminal justice problems in Indian Country.

Clinton Administration's Accomplishments
      In addition to seeking increased funding for the Interior Department, and tribal control of
       law enforcement programs on Indian lands, the Clinton COPS Program has helped tribal
       law enforcement agencies to hire officers in Indian Country.

      This year, the FBI established an Office of Indian Country Investigations in its Violent
       Crimes Section, allocating additional agents to Indian Country. The FBI also initiated a
       nationwide training program for Indian Country law enforcement officers.
                                                                              Hex-Dump ConversIon




MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
                   THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                   ALL FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

SUBJECT:                       Registration Of Sex Offenders Adjudicated in Federal or
                               Military Courts


A recent Justice Department report found that on any given day, 60%, or over 140,000 of the
234,000 convicted sex offenders under the care of corrections officials, are living in the
community on either probation or parole. We have taken steps to guard our communities
against repeat offenses by these sex offenders by enacting the "Jacob Wetterling Act," "Megan's
Law" and the "Pam Lychner Act." Among other things, these important pieces oflegislation
require States to make public relevant information about released child molesters and sexually
violent offenders.

We have also worked to ensure that the information gathered in all 50 States is available on a
nationwide basis. Last June, I directed the Justice Department to develop a national sexual
predator and child molester registration system-- which for the first time would link together the
sex offender registration systems being developed in all 50 states. The FBI recently announced
that its interim national sex offender registry had become operational. Once complete, this
system will allow arresting officers and others to immediately identify an individual as a
convicted sex offender and indicate where that person is registered.

Much still needs to be done to make this system an effective tool in combating and preventing
sex crimes. The new national registry will only be as good as the quality of the information on
sex offenders that it contains. We must forge a close partnership between the FBI, other federal
agencies, and state law enforcement agencies in ensuring that accurate and up-to-date
information on the whereabouts of sex offenders is timely loaded into the system and available to
those who need it.

Some states have already risen to this challenge and are loading their sex offender information
into the national system. Other states are moving rapidly toward that objective. But, for the
system to work, all states must work together. We have called upon every state to load its
information on sex offenders into the national registration system as soon as possible.

At the same time, it is important that sex offenders adjudicated in federal or military courts are
registered, including those released from federal or military prisons, or placed on probation. The
potential danger to the public from a released child molester or sexually violent offender whose
whereabouts are unknown to the authorities is the same, regardless of whether the offender was
convicted in a state, federal, or military court.                          Hex-Dump Conversion

I am accordingly directing the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense to maximize the
use of current administrative options to ensure that: (1) federal and military authorities notifY
the appropriate state authorities concerning the release to their areas of sex offenders adjudicated
in federal or military courts; (2) sex offenders adjudicated in federal or military courts are
required to register in the states where they reside; and (3) complete and current information on
released sex offenders adjudicated in federal or military courts will be included in the registries
of the states where they reside and in the national sex offender registry. I am also asking the
Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense to report, within 60 days, on any legislative
changes that would be needed to realize these objectives fully and to allow the national sex
offender registry to completely realize its important potential. Finally, I encourage federal and
state cooperation with Indian tribes toward the inclusion of sex offenders who have been
adjudicated through tribal justice systems .

            Clinton Administration: Protecting Children from Sex Offenders
              Registration of Federal and Military Sex Offenders Initiative

                                    Questions and Answers

                                            June 24, 1997



Q.      What is the President announcing today?

A.      Building on the Clinton Administration's record of protecting our children from sex
offenders, the President directed the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and all federal
law enforcement agencies to ensure that federal and military sex offenders are registered, both in
the state in which they live and in the national sex offender registry.

      The President's directive instructs the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense to
maximize the use of administrative optior:ts to ensure that:

               federal and military authorities notify state authorities concerning the release of
                sex offenders from their facilities;

               federal and military sex offenders are required to register in states where they
                reside; and

               complete and current information on released federal and military sex offenders
                will be included in appropriate state registries and the national sex offender
                registry.

        President Clinton has also asked the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense to
report back to him within 60 days on any legislative changes that would be needed to fully
implement the directive.


Q.     Aren't these sex offenders already required to be registered?

A.      Under current law, states are encouraged but not required to register federal and military
sex offenders. States do have the legal authority to require released federal and military
offenders to register, just as they can require offenders convicted in other states to register if they
move in. Today's directive to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, and all federal
law enforcement agencies will help ensure that federal and military sex offenders are registered,
both in the state in which they live and the national sex offender registry.
                                                                             Hex텱ump Conversion

Q.     How many sex offenders are out of jail or prison and on the streets?

A.      A recent Justice Department report found that on any given day, about 60% of the
234,000 convicted sex offenders under supervision of corrections officials are living in the
community, either on probation or parole. That is why the Clinton Administration has made
protecting our children from sex offenders a national priority.


Q.     How many federal and military sex offenders will be affected by the directive?

A.      Using available data from the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense, the
annual number that could be affected is estimated to be about 340 sex offenders. In 1995, there
were about 150 federal sex offenders either on probation or who had completed their probation
that year. The Department of Defense estimates that over the next 12 months, an estimated 190
military sex offenders will be released from military facilities.


Q.     What is the status of the national sex offender registry the President announced last
       year? Is it readily accessible to law enforcement?

A.      In June 1996, President Clinton directed the Attorney General to establish a national
sexual predator and child molester registration system to help link together the sex offender and
notification systems being developed in all 50 states.

       The national sex offender registry became operational in February-- allowing law
enforcement agencies to search the FBI's criminal history record database to determine whether
an individual is a registered sex offender, and if so, where he or she is registered.

        Earlier this month, the Attorney General sent letters to all 50 governors asking them to
load their state information into the national sexual predator registry. All states must join us to
make this national registry a success. Close partnerships must be formed between the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information on the
whereabouts of sex offenders is loaded into the system available to those who need it.


Q.     What else has this Administration done to protect communities and children from
       sex offenders?

A.      The Clinton Administration has a strong record of support for protecting our children and
families from sexual predators. In 1994, President Clinton signed the Jacob Wetterling Crimes
Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act ("Wetterling Act"), as part of
the 1994 Crime Act. That Act encourages states to establish effective registration systems for
convicted child molesters and other sexually violent offenders.

       In May 1996, the President signed Megan's Law, which amended the Wetterling Act to
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


require states to release relevant infonnation that is necessary to protect the public concerning
registered sex offenders. Prior to the enactment of Megan's Law, the Wetterling Act pennitted,
but did not require, such disclosure. Building on these laws, in October 1996, the President
signed the Pam Lynchner Act, which strengthens the Wetterling Act's registration requirements.


Q.     Isn't there legislation moving through the Congress which would basically
       accomplish what is in the President's directive?

A.      While pending legislative proposals include provisions regarding offenders adjudicated in
federal and military tribunals, the proposals do not fully and adequately address the issue. The
legislative proposals provide principally that such offenders must register in accordance with the
laws of the state in which they reside, and that federal and military authorities must ensure the
offenders are notified of the registration obligation. We support the objectives of these
proposals. However, there is no assurance that states will require them to register. At present,
most states do not have such a requirement.

        The President's directive would help make these registration systems more effective by:
ensure that notification by federal and military authorities to the appropriate state authorities
concerning the release in their areas of sex offenders adjudicated in federal and military courts;
requiring that offenders register in the state where they reside and a requirement that...

       Moreover, there are aspects of the directive which we anticipate can be done
administratively-- without any legislation. These measures could be put into effect more
expeditiously than passing new legislation.
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

            Clinton Administration: Protecting Children from Sex Offenders
              Registration of Federal and Military Sex Offenders Initiative
                                              June 24, 1997


    Announcement
        Today, President Clinton directed the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and all
         federal law enforcement agencies to ensure that federal and military sex offenders are
         registered, both in the state in which they live and in the national sex offender registry.
         Today's directive is an important step that builds upon the Clinton Administration's
         record of protecting our children from sex offenders.

    Background
    A recent Justice Department report found that on any given day, about 60% of the 234,000
    convicted sex offenders under the care of corrections officials are living in communities, either
    on probation or parole. Over the last few years, the Clinton Administration has made protecting
    our children from sex offenders a national priority.

          The 1994 Clinton Crime Act required sex offenders to register in the state in which they
           live; increased penalties for sexual abuse offenses and certain offenses against youthful
           victims; and broadened pretrial detention for serious sex offenses cases.

          In May 1996, President Clinton signed Megan's Law to ensure that communities are
           notified when sex offenders are in their midst. In June 1996, President Clinton directed
           the Attorney General to establish a national sexual predator and child molester
           registration system. This computerized system will help link together the sex offender
           and notifications systems being developed in all 50 states.

          The national sex offender registry became operational in February-- allowing law
           enforcement agencies to search the FBI's criminal history record database to determine
           whether an individual is a registered sex offender, and if so, where he or she is registered.
            Close partnerships must be formed between the FBI and other law enforcement agencies
           to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information on the whereabouts of sex offenders is
           loaded into the system and available to those who need it.                  .

    Today's Measure
         The directive instructs the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense to ensure that:
                 1) federal and military authorities provide appropriate state authorities with
                            information concerning the release of sex offenders from their facilities;
                 2) federal and military sex offenders are required to register in the states where
                           they reside; and
                 3) complete and current information on released federal and military sex offenders
                       will be included in appropriate state registries and the national registry.

          In addition, President Clinton has asked the Attorney General and the Secretary of
           Defense to report back to him within 60 days on any legislative changes that might be
           needed to fully implement the directive.
