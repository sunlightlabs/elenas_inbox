                                         Achieving a Budget Solution
                                 The First Step:   Drop Controversial Riders
                                                         October 5,1998

The President has proposed a budget that focuses on the basic fundamentals needed to
keep the country moving forward:
                       Saving Social Security First.                            Alli8ffi~f~a AtlCords Management System
                   _   Investing in education and in a cleaner environment.    Hek4>Uiftp Conversion
                   _   Leading the response to the global financial turmoil.
The Congressional Majority has taken its eye off of these basic fundamentals. That is why
they failed to even pass a budget resolution, despite a April 15th legal deadline. And why they sent only one
appropriations bill to the President's desk before the fiscal year began. Instead of focusing on basic budget
decisions and making the needed investments:
               The Congress has loaded down the appropriations bills with scores of controversial and
                objectionable riders. Many of these controversial items have not been debated, hearings have
                not been held, and they do not belong on appropriations bills. These riders are an unnecessary
                distraction that pose a major obstacle to achieving a budget solution.

The time has come to return the focus to the basic task at hand: achieving a budget
solution. Dropping these controversial riders is the critical first step needed to achieve success. It is time
to put progress over partisanship and to put common sense over ideology.
Examples of riders that should be dropped:
       Assaults on the Environment -- Scores of anti-environmental riders would sacrifice public lands to
        private interests by mandating overcutting on national forests, carving roads through wilderness, and
        denying taxpayers a fair return on oil leasing on federal lands. Other riders aim to cripple wildlife
        protections and thwart common-sense efforts to reverse global warming.
       Undermining ofthe Brady Law -- Extraneous language included would undermine FBI background
        checks related to the Brady handgun law. This is a law that the American people resoundingly support and
        its implementation should not be undermined.
       Denial of an accurate Census. The statistical methods incorporated in the Census Bureau's plan,
        which are based on recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences, would produce the
        most accurate census possible and virtually eliminate the large undercounts of minorities, children,
        and other groups that occurred in the 1990 census. The onerous House language restrictions on the
        Census should be dropped.
       Private School Vouchers -- House language provides for the use of private school vouchers in the
        District of Columbia.     Instead of investing additional resources in public schools, vouchers would
        allow a few selected students to attend private schools and would draw resources and attention away
        from the hard work of reforming public schools that serve the overwhelming majority of D.C.
        students. This would establish a dangerous precedent for using Federal taxpayer funds for schools
        that are not accountable to the public.
       Prohibition on National Voluntary Education Testing -- The House has included language would
        prohibit the development, implementation, and administration of the tests unless explicitly
        authorized. This would bring a halt to the President's efforts to help States and parents raise
        academic standards through a voluntary national test.
       Undermining of Worker Safety Efforts -- House language would undermine efforts to protect worker
        safety and should be dropped.
    with family planning organizations. They should be dropped.
