                   WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON MENTAL HEALTH:
                        WORKING FOR A HEALTHIER AMERICA

                                 DATE:                          June 7, 1999
                                 LOCATION:                      Blackburn Auditorium
                                                                Howard University

                                 FROM:                          Bruce Reed, Audrey Tayse-Haynes,
                                                                Marsha Scott


I.        PURPOSE

          To bring together a broad coalition of consumers, providers, advocacy groups, business
          leaders, state, local, and national elected officials, and leaders in the mental health
          research and pharmacology, service delivery and insurance coverage - as well as
          communities across the country through over 1,000 satellite sites - to increase awareness
          on issues surrounding mental illness and its impact on people of all ages.

II.       BACKGROUND

          Today, at the first-ever White House Conference on Mental Health, chaired by your
          Mental Health Advisor Tipper Gore, the Clinton/Gore Administration will unveil
          unprecedented measures to improve mental health. "We are taking new steps to
          breakdown the myths and misperceptions of mental illness and to encourage and enable
          Americans to get the care they need," said Tipper Gore. The Administration's proposals
          provide parity, improve treatment, bolster research, and expand community responses to
          help those with mental illnesses. Highlights of these initiatives include:

         Ensuring that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) -- the nation's
          largest private insurer - implements full mental health and substance abuse parity.
          Today, the Office of Personnel Management is sending a letter to the 285 participating
          health plans informing them that starting next year they will have to offer full mental
          health and substance abuse parity to participate in the program. This step will provide full
          parity for nine million beneficiaries by next year and ensure that the Federal government
          leads the way to providing parity. The Department of Labor is also launching a new
          outreach campaign to inform Americans about their rights under the Mental Health Parity
          Act of 1996.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion



   Launching national school safety training program for teachers and education
    personnel. You will announce a major nationwide public/private partnership between
    the National Education Association (NEA), EchoSiar, and other partners to improve
    school safety. The partnership, which includes the Departments of Education, Justice,
    and Health and Human Services, will create and run a comprehensive program that will
    be available at the beginning of the new school year with the goal of reaching every
    school across the country and providing training to teachers, school personnel, and
    community members on how to improve school safety.

   Accelerating progress in research. In July, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
    will launch a $7.3 million landmark study to determine the nature of mental illness and
    treatment nationwide and to help guide strategies and policy for the next century. This
    new study will collect information on mental illness, including the prevalence and
    duration of mental illness as well as the types of treatment that are most commonly used.
    NIMH also will announce the launch of two new clinical trials, investing a total of $61
    million, to build on effective treatments for those affected by mental illness.

   Encouraging states to offer more coordinated Medicaid services for people with
    mental illness. Millions of Americans with severe mental illness rely on Medicaid to pay
    for their health care. To encourage states to make the most effective services available,
    the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) will advise all state Medicaid
    directors that: (I) Medicaid will reimburse for services provided in Assertive Community
    Treatment (ACT) programs targeting people with the most severe and persistent mental
    illness; (2) Medicaid recipients all have access to medications approved by FDA for the
    treatment of serious mental illnesses; and (3) states should educate Medicaid providers
    and beneficiaries about their ability to enter into "advance planning directives" that set
    out treatment guideline for people who became severely incapacitated in the future.

   Launching a pilot program to help people with mental illness get the quality
    treatment they need to return to work. Of the 4.7 million Americans that receive
    Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), the Social Security Administration (SSA)
    estimates that approximately one in nine (about 500,000) has an affective disorder (such
    as depression or a bipolar disorder). Research suggests that many of the people suffering
    with these disorders could get effective treatment and perhaps return to work. The
    Administration will launch a new five-year, $10 million demonstration to provide
    treatment for SSDI beneficiaries with affective disorders. This complements the Jeffords-
    Kennedy-Roth-Moynihan legislation, which allows people to buy into the Medicaid or
    Medicare program when they return to work.



   Educating older Americans and their health professionals about the risks of
    depression. Five million Americans over the age of 65 suffer from some form of
    depression, but many do not recognize their symptoms as depression and do not receive
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

    the treatment they need. NIMH and the Administration on Aging (AoA) will launch an
    outreach initiative to educate the elderly and their healthcare professionals about mental
    illness. The Department of Veteran Affairs will also launch six new study sites to test two
    modes of primary care for older Americans with mental health and/or substance abuse
    disorders.

   Reaching out to vulnerable homeless Americans with mental illnesses. The
    Department of Housing and Urban Development is launching a new initiative to
    encourage communities to create safe havens where homeless mentally ill Americans can
    get treatment and care. HHS will also launch a two-year, $4.8 million grant program to
    study the treatment, housing, education, training, and support services needed by
    homeless women and their children given to as many as 2,000 homeless mothers and their
    4,000 children, many of whom suffer from mental illnesses. The Department of Veteran
    Affairs will double the number of "stand down" events to reach out to homeless
    Americans with mental illness to help them get the treatment and services they need.

   Implementing new strategies to meet the mental health needs of crime victims. To
    ensure that the federal response to community crises, like acts of terrorism or mass
    violence, includes a strong mental health component, the Administration is announcing a
    new interagency partnership between the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of
    Crime and the Center for Mental Health Services within the Substance Abuse and Mental
    Health Services Administration (SAMSHA). This partnership also will ensure that
    strategies are in place to address the mental health needs of victims of violent crime.

   Developing and implementing new strategies to address mental illness in the
    criminal justice system. SAMHSA and DOJ are hosting a conference later this summer
    to focus on how the criminal justice system can prevent crime by mentally ill people and
    can address the needs of offenders with mental illness. Following this conference, DOJ
    will launch an outreach effort to educate the criminal justice community on how to better
    serve people with mental health needs. This initiative will include a new partnership with
    the National GAINS center so that communities interested in pursuing these approaches
    can get technical assistance and ideas about how to implement successful strategies.

   Implementing' a new comprehensive approach to address combat stress in the
    military. At least 30 percent of those who have spent time in war zones experience
    combat stress reaction. Today you will direct the Department of Defense to report back
    within 180 days on an implementation plan for a comprehensive combat stress program
    throughout the military. DOD will also hold a conference this fall to develop strategies
    and educate military leaders and medical personnel about the need to enhance current
    prevention strategies.

   Launching the expansion of the "Caring For Every Child" mental health campaign.
    At least one in ten American children and adolescents may have behavioral, or mental
    health problems. The Administration will launch a five-year $5 million dollar campaign
    in targeted communities to highlight the special mental health needs of children.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


         Improving the mental health of Native American youth. The suicide rate for Native
          Americans between the ages of five and 24 years old is three times higher than the rest of
          the U.S. population in this age group. This initiative allocates at least $5 million for a
          collaboration between the Departments of Interior, Justice, Education, and HHS, to go to
          ten Native American communities to develop effective strategies to address mental health
          needs of youth in settings such as the home, school, treatment centers, and the juvenile
          justice,system.

         The Administration Also Challenged Congress to Pass Legislation to Improve Care
          and Services for People with Mental Illness. The Administration urged Congress to:
          ~ Pass the Jeffords-Kennedy-Roth-Moynihan-Lazio-Waxman-Bliley-Dingell
             legislation, which would enable people with disabilities to return to work by accessing
             affordable health insurance.
          ~ Hold hearings on the mental health parity law to review its strengths and weaknesses,
          ~ Fund the historic $70 million increase in the mental health grant.
          ~ Pass a strong enforceable patients' bill of rights which ensures that people with
             mental health needs obtain critical protections such as access to specialists and the
             continuity of care protections.
          ~ Pass strong comprehensive privacy and legislation to eliminate genetic
             discrimination.
