        Clinton Administration: Protecting Children from Sex Offenders
          Registration of Federal and Military Sex Offenders Initiative
                                           June 24, 1997


Announcement
    Today, President Clinton directed the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and all
     federal law enforcement agencies to ensure that federal and military sex offenders are
     registered, both in the state in which they live and in the national sex offender registry.
     Today's directive is an important step that builds upon the Clinton Administration's
     record of protecting our children from sex offenders.

Background
A recent Justice Department report found that on any given day, about 60% of the 234,000
convicted sex offenders under the care of corrections officials are living in communities, either
on probation or parole. Over the last few years, the Clinton Administration has made protecting
our children from sex offenders a national priority.

      The 1994 Clinton Crime Act required sex offenders to register in the state in which they
       live; increased penalties for sexual abuse offenses and certain offenses against youthful
       victims; and broadened pretrial detention for serious sex offenses cases.

      In May 1996, President Clinton signed Megan's Law to ensure that communities are
       notified when sex offenders are in their midst. In June 1996, President Clinton directed
       the Attorney General to establish a national sexual predator and child molester
       registration system. This computerized system will help link together the sex offender
       and notifications systems being developed in all 50 states.

      The national sex offender registry became operational in February-- allowing law
       enforcement agencies to search the FBI's criminal history record database to determine
       whether an individual is a registered sex offender, and if so, where he or she is regi톝tered.
        Close partnerships must be formed between the FBI and other law enforcement agencies
       to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information on the whereabouts of sex offenders is
       loaded into the system and available to those who need it.

Today's Measure
     The directive instructs the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense to ensure that:
             1) federal and military authorities provide appropriate state authorities with
                        information concerning the release of sex offenders from their facilities;
             2) federal and military sex offenders are required to register in the states where
                       they reside; and
             3) complete and current information on released federal and military sex offenders
                   will be included in appropriate state registries and the national registry.

      In addition, President Clinton has asked the Attorney General and the Secretary of
       Defense to report back to him within 60 days on any legislative changes that might be
       needed to fully implement the directive.
