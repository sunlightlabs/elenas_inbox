                                        WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON Hex-Dum Conversion
    EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING: WHAT NE~ RESEARCH ON
             THE BRAIN TELLS US ABOUT OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN

    "Learning begins in the first days of life. Scientists are now discovering IlOw young children develop emotionally
    and intellectually from their very first days, and how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing,
    even reading to their infants.... We already know we should start teaching children before they start school. "

                                                                                       --President Bill Clinton, State of
    the Union Address, February 4, 1997

Today, President Clinton issued a statement announcing the date and themes of the White House Conference on
Early Childhood Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest
Children. The day-long Conference will take place on April 17, 1997 at the White House. The President and
First Lady chose this subject because of how critically important children's experiences before school are to
their development and their success both in school and later in life.

The Conference will focus on the practical applications of the scientific research on the brain, in particular for
parents and care-givers. Also central to the Conference will be a discussion of the ways all sectors of society,
including medical, business, government, faith and child care providers, can help to enhance early childhood
development and support families.

Over the last four years, the Clinton Administration has invested heavily in medical research to help us
better understand the importance of the first few years to child development and learning, and in
strengthening efforts that support families and caregivers with young children, including:

         Increased NIH Research Funding 23%. Unlike other research areas, the federal government is
          almost the sole funder of research of children and youth, supporting over 90% of research on children
          and youth. The Clinton Administration increased NIH research funding by 23% in four years to $12.7
          billion this year, supporting much of the research that the April White House Conference will explore.
          [run this bullet by OSTP, NIH, OMB]

         Enhanced Head Start Participation and Quality and Created the Early Head Start Program for
          Children 0-3. The Clinton Administration has increased Head start participation by nearly 90,000 and
          funding by 43% over the last four years, and created the Early Start program in 1994 to support families
          with children ages zero to three. Head Start provides low-income children and their families with
          comprehensive education, health services, and nutrition.

         Dramatically Increased Participation in WIC. The Clinton Administration increased participation in
          the WIC Supplemental Nutrition Program, providing 7.4 million pregnant women, infants, and children
          with nutrition packages and information and health referrals -- 1.7 million more than when President
          Clinton took office. Research shows that every $1 invested in WIC prenatal serves saves up to $4 in
          Medicaid costs in the first 60 days after birth. [USDA, 1990 Mathematica Policy Research].

         Leading National Effort to Raise Immunization Rates. In 1993, the Clinton Administration
          launched a national effort to raise childhood immunization rates by reducing vaccination costs for
          parents, improving vaccines and vaccine delivery services, and increasing community education and
          partnerships. Today, childhood immunization rates are at a record high.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

                                      The White House

                            Statement by the President
                       Announcing White House Conference
                   On Early Childhood Development and Learning


       Hillary and I are delighted that on April 17, 1997, we will host the White House
Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain
Tells Us About Our Youngest Children. This Conference builds on my Administration's
commitment to improving the lives of all children, including our youngest children.

        We hope that this one-day Conference will help to make more accessible and
understandable current scientific research on the brain -- research that makes clear the critical
importance of children's first few years of life to their cognitive, emotional and social
development. We chose this topic for the first Conference we hold at the White House because
of how important children's experiences before school are to their success in school and later in
life. Hillary has been studying and working on these issues for years, and they have been a
priority of my Administration for the past four years.

         With this Conference, we hope to enable more Americans to benefit from new research
findings on early childhood development, much of which was funded by the federal government.
 Central to the Conference will be an examination of how we can use this new information in
practical ways, to be better parents, more informed care-givers and more responsive members of
our communities. The Conference will also explore what all sectors of our society --
including business, faith, medical, government and child care providers -- are doing differently as
a result of this research and what more could be to support families and enhance early childhood
development.

       Hillary and I have always believed that nearly all parents, no matter how young, how
uneducated or how poor they might be, desperately want to do a good job and do right by
their children. And we all have a responsibility to equip America's parents with the best
information we have about what children need to thrive.
