                                    Expand Family and Medical Leave
                                               April 12, 1997
                                               -DRAFf-
     Next week's White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning: What
      New Research on The Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest Children will explore new
      information that shows the importance of the first few years of life. It will underscore the need to
      ensure that parents who work outside the home can take some time off to make sure that their young
      children get the routine medical care they need, to find nurturing child care, and to participate in
      their children's education.

     To assist families in meeting the needs of young children and other family members, the
      President called on Congress to pass legislation expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act_
        The FMLA currently allows workers to take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave to care for a newborn or
      adopted child, to attend to their own serious health needs, or to care for a seriously ill parent, child,
      or spouse.     In June, 1996 President Clinton proposed to expand the Family and Medical Leave
      Act (FMLA) to allow workers to take unpaid hours off -- up to 24 hours a year -- for school and
      early childhood education activities, routine family medical care, and additional activities related to
      caring for an elderly relative.

     Today President Clinton asked Federal agencies to implement his expanded leave policy
      immediately for Federal workers_ The President asked agencies to ensure employees can
      schedule and be granted up to 24 hours of unpaid leave for the following activities:
               School and early childhood education activities -- to allow employees to participate in
                school activities directly related to the educational advancement of a child, including
                educational activities related to child care, Head Start programs, elementary school and
                secondary school. Parental involvement in a child's education is an important
                determinant of the child's success. Parents could use leave to attend parent-teacher
                conferences or meetings with child-care providers, or to interview for a new school or
                child care facility.
               Routine family medical purposes - to allow parents to accompany children to routine
                medical or dental appointments, such as annual checkups or vaccinations.
               Elderly relatives' health and care needs -- to allow employees to accompany an elderly
                relative to routine medical appointments or other professional services related to the care
                of the elderly relative, such as making arrangements for housing, meals, phones, banking
                services, and other similar activities.

       The Family and Medical Leave Act Works_ The bipartisan Commission on Leave reported last
        year that more than 12 million American workers have taken leave for reaSOllS covered by the
        FMLA since its enactment in 1993, and 40% of businesses covered by the law frod that it's easy to
        administer and that it costs them little or nothing.

       The Clinton Administration is Building a Family Friendly Federal Workplace.
              In 1994 the President signed the Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act allowing
               employees to use sick leave for routine medical appointments for family members.
              Federal employers have authority now to approve employees' requests for time off for
               school activities, routine medical visits, and elder care. Today, the President asked the
               Federal agencies to ensure all federal employees have up to 24 hours of unpaid time off
               for these activities. and to honor employees' requests to use paid time of for these
               purposes.
              Federal agencies are working with the Vice President's National Performance Review to
                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
further family friendly work arrangements.
