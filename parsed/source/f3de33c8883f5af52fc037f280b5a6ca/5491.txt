MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:       EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ZONES

         This initiative, which you discussed in your Town Hall meeting earlier this week, would
designate from 20 to 40 urban and rural school districts as Education Opportunity Zones.
Education Opportunity Zones would have a strong focus on standards, accountability, and
perfonnance. High-poverty urban and rural school districts would be eligible for additional
Federal funding, under this proposal, if (1) they adopt tough reform measures -- like those in
Chicago -- that make administrators, principals, teachers, and students accountable for success or
failure, and (2) in time, show real improvements in student achievement. As proposed, the
initiative would cost between $221 million and $320 million in FY 99 ($1.1 billion to $1.3
billion over five years).

Conditions and Purposes of Funding

       To receive funds, local school districts would have to demonstrate how they will:

      provide students and parents with expanded choice within public education;

      hold schools accountable for helping students reach high academic standards, including
       rewarding schools that succeed and intervening in schools that fail to make progress;

      hold teachers and principals accountable for quality, including rewarding outstanding
       teachers, and fairly and quickly removing ineffective teachers;

      require students to meet academic standards at key transition points in their academic
       careers.

       School districts could use Education Opportunity Zone funds to:

      provide extra help to students who need it to meet challenging standards, through
       after-school or Saturday tutoring programs and/or summer school;

      provide bonuses to schools that make significant gains in student achievement;

      turn around failing schools by implementing proven reform models, providing intensive
       teacher training, building stronger partnerships between schools and parents, businesses,
       and community-based organizations, or closing down failing schools and reopening them
       as charter schools.

      provide needed training to teachers and princIpals; reward outstanding teachers by
       helping them earn certification as master teachers from the National Board for
                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

             Professional Teaching standards and providing them with financial bonuses when they
             do; and implement programs to identify low performing teachers, assist them to improve,
             and remove them if they fail to do so.

      Funding Levels

             As proposed, the Department of Education would award 3-year competitive grants to
      10-20 urban school districts and 10-20 rural school districts or consortia (including districts
      serving Native American students) selected as Education Opportunity Zones. Each urban
      Education Opportunity Zone would receive approximately $10-25 million in its first year, and
      each rural zone would receive from $500,000 to $5 million (for consortia).

              Each participating district would receive a declining share of federal support in years 2
      and 3 to ensure that reforms can be sustained over the long term. Continued support in years 4
      and 5 would be contingent upon demonstrated success in raising student achievement and
      willingness to work with similar districts to help them replicate successful reforms. A total of
      $16 million would be available each year for national activities, such as providing technical
      assistance, documenting successes, and disseminating lessons learned to urban and rural
      communities across the U.S.                         .

            We are currently considering two options for funding the initiative -- one with a greater
      FY 99 cost, the other with a greater 5-year cost.

            Option 1: The Department of Education would select only one group of zones --
             approximately 15 urban and 15 rural. FY 99 request: $320 million, with a five year cost
             (including national activities) of$1.07 billion.

             Option 2: The Department of Education would select two groups of zones --
            . approximately 10 urban and 10 rural zones beginning in year 1 (FY 99) and an additional
              10 urban and 10 rural zones beginning in year 2 (FY 00). FY 99 request: $205 million,
              with a five year cost (including national activities) of$1.31 billion.

      Outstanding Issues

              We are still working with other offices and the Department of Education on some
      remaining issues with this initiative. First, we are developing a component that would give
      Education Opportunity Zones greater flexibility in the use of other federal education funds as
      long as they continue to meet agreed-upon performance goals. In addition, we are exploring
      whether we could fund this initiative under existing authority, rather than seek new legislative
      authorization.
