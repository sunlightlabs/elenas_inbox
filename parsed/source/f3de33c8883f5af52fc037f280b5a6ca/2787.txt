     The Administration strongly opposes the House Ways and Means Subcommittee
      proposal, which violates the bipartisan budget agreement, treats disabled legal immigrants'
      unfairly, and prevents working welfare recipients from getting a minimum wage.

     The Administration is pleased that the Ways and Means Subcommittee $3 billion
      welfare-to-work proposal meets many of the Administration's priorities. These include:
      targeting funds to areas and individuals with high needs, directing funds to cities and
      local governments, awarding some funds competitively, and allowing communities to
      create successful job placement and creation programs.

     But the provisions of the Subcommittee proposal addressing legal immigrants and the
      minimum wage are clearly unacceptable.

Legal Immigrants
     The Ways and Means Subcommittee's proposed amendment to the welfare law clearly
      violates the negotiated, bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a minimal safety net
      for disabled legal immigrants. The Subcommittee's proposal would restore SSI and
      Medicaid benefits only to immigrants already receiving benefits prior to August 23,
      1996; by contrast, the bipartisan budget agreement policy restores SSI and Medicaid
      benefits to any immigrant in the country as of that date who is or becomes disabled.

     The Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal would protect 75,000 fewer immigrants
      than the budget agreement by the year 2002. And in leaving unprotected any person who
      becomes disabled after August 22, 1996, it fails to target assistance to the most vulnerable
      individuals.

Minimum Wage
     The Administration also strongly opposes the Ways and Means Subcommittee's
      provision on the minimum wage, which undermines the fundamental goals of welfare
      reform.

     The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work must work -- and that
      those who work should earn the minimum wage, whether they are coming off of welfare
      or not.

     The House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal does not meet this test. It
      effectively creates a subminimum wage for workfare participants. And it weakens the
      welfare law's work requirements.

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

The Ways and Means Subcommittee's proposed amendment to the welfare law clearly violates
the negotiated, bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a minimal safety net for disabled
legal immigrants. The Subcommittee's proposal would restore SSI and Medicaid benefits only
to immigrants (both the disabled and non-disabled elderly) already receiving benefits prior to
August 23, 1996; by contrast, the bipartisan budget agreement policy restores SSI and Medicaid
benefits to any immigrant in the country as of that date who is or becomes disabled. The budget
agreement targets assistance to the most vulnerable individuals.

      THE WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL IGNORES
       VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS WHO BECOME DISABLED AFTER AUGUST
       22,1996: This proposal abandons many legal immigrants who were in the u.S. when
       the welfare law was signed but become severely disabled after that date. In contrast, the
       bipartisan budget agreement protects these immigrants.

      BY THE YEAR 2002, THE WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL
       WOULD PROTECT 75,000 FEWER IMMIGRANTS THAN THE BUDGET
       AGREEMENT. This number grows to 125,000 by the year 2007.

       Exaniple: A legal immigrant family entered the country 3 years ago. Both the father and
       mother have worked full-time since then, and have an annual income of about $25,000,
       but neither job provides health insurance for themselves or the family. Their 5 year-old
       son becomes severely disabled in a car accident next year. Under the budget agreement,
       he would be eligible for SSI and Medicaid; under the Ways and Means Subcommittee's
       proposal he would be denied SSI -- and potentially denied Medicaid.

Question:     Doesn't the Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal treat the elderly better than
              the Administration's proposal, while the Administration's policy favors the
              disabled? Isn't this really a wash?

Answer:       The parties to the budget agreement already made the decision about where to
              target limited resources. The agreement explicitly states the policy of restoring
              SSI and Medicaid eligibility to immigrants who are or become disabled and who
              are in the U.S. as of August 22, 1996. This is one of the specific policies agreed
              to by the President and the Congressional leadership. Furthermore, the
              Leadership Council of Aging Organizations and the Consortium of Citizens with
              Disabilities state that they will not support "any reductions in benefits to
              immigrants with disabilities in order to provide them to other groups of
              immigrants."

              The Administration believes that the budget agreement appropriately targets the
              most vulnerable individuals. It provides for all immigrants in the country when
              the welfare law was signed who have suffered -- or may suffer in the future -- a
              disabling accident or illness. At the same time, the agreement will result in
              restoring benefits to a full 80% of the caseload as of August 22, 1996 -- all of
              those now classified as disabled plus approximately two-thirds of the elderly
              caseload who can be reclassified as disabled.

We are pleased that the Ways and Means subcommittee has included in its mark a $3 billion
welfare-to-work proposal that meets many of the Administration's priorities:

      It directs funds where they're needed most:  to help long term recipients in cities and
       other communities with large numbers of poor people;
      It awards some funds on a competitive basis, assuring the best use of scarce resources;
      It provides communities with appropriate flexibility to use the funds to create successful
       job placement and creation programs.

We are pleased that Congressman Shaw was willing to work in a bipartisan basis to incorporate
many of the Administration's priorities.

We are, however, deeply disappointed at the subcommittee draft's lack of adequate worker
protections and non-displacement provisions, and urge the subcommittee to add language that
will better protect against worker displacement.

The President proposed a $3 billion welfare to work program last fall and fought to have it
included in the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. A centerpiece of the President's
second-term agenda, the proposal will help move one million adults from welfare to work by the
year 2000.

Background: The Labor Department has concluded that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
applies to welfare recipients in workfare or other subsidized employment programs in the same
way as that law applies to all other employees. This means that most welfare recipients in these
programs will receive at least the minimum wage.

The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources proposes to amend the welfare
law so that welfare recipients engaged in workfare would not be employees for the purposes of
the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other federal law. Although requiring the minimum wage
for hours worked, the proposal would permit states to count child care, Medicaid, and housing
benefits in their calculation of the minimum wage. It would also allow states to count additional
hours of job search, education, and training toward the welfare law's work requirements.

The Administration strongly opposes the Ways and Means Subcommittee's provision on
the minimum wage and welfare work requirements.

      This Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal would undermine the fundamental goals
       of welfare reform. The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work
       must work -- and that those who work should earn the minimum wage, whether they are
       coming off of welfare or not.

      The House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal does not meet this test. It
       effectively creates a subminimum wage for workfare participants. And it weakens the
       welfare law's work requirements.

      This Subcommittee proposal also was not addressed in the budget agreement between the
       White House and Congress and should therefore not be included in the reconciliation bill.
