  I gave a draft of this to Barbara Chow; Hilley is pushing to get the
  briefing memo done quickly, but I've told them you are out, haven't seen
  this yet, and should see the briefing memo before it goes.

                                                                       Automated Records Management System
    Proposal to Goodling:                             .                Hex-Dump Conversion
    We propose to resolve our differences with Goodling by: (1) postponing a final resolution on the
    issue of the implementation of national tests for another two years; (2) allowing the development
    and field testing of the tests to proceed over the next two years (a one-year delay in our original
    plan); and, (3) simultaneous with national test development, commissioning the National
    Academy of Sciences and the National Assessment Governing Board to conduct a series of
    studies to determine which, if any, state or commercially available tests could be equated to the
    national tests in a valid and reliable manner. (This approach builds on an approach initially
    proposed by Mr. Goodling.)

    In effect, both approaches would proceed in the "development" phase over the next two years.
    There would then be adequate information to determine whether a single national test is required
    in order to measure student performance against national standards, if existing tests can perform
    that function adequately, or if a combination of both approaches is needed.

      We anticipate that we will be in a stronger position to gain support for implementation of our
      national tests at the end of the two year period, as a result ofNAGB's bipartisan leadership, and
      the completion of development and field testing. In addition, we believe strongly that the studies
    . of other tests will show that very few commercially produced or state-developed tests can
      appropriately be equated with national standards, though the opportunity to do so may provide an
      incentive for commercial test publishers to modify their tests.

    More specifically, under this approach, work on the national tests would proceed as follows:
         NAGB would be in charge oftest development, as in the Senate-passed b,m
         Pilot testing of test questions would occur in the Spring of 1998, involving a national
          sample of approximately 600 schools and 46,000 students
         Field testing of the tests, including administration and scoring procedures, would occur in
          Spring 1999, involving a national sample of approximately 1,400 schools and 100,000
          students
         It would be possible in the Spring of 1999 to also administer the national tests to the 7
          states and 15 school districts that have already signed up for the test, as a trial
          administration.
         The first nationwide implementation of the tests would occur in Spring, 2000.

    At the same time, feasibility studies would be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences
    and the National Assessment Governing Board to determine if specific tests could be equated to
    the national test in a reliable and valid fashion. Tests that can be equated to.the national tests
    would be able to provide individual student scores in terms of the national test achievement
    levels (e.g., basic, proficient, or advanced). This process would work as follows:
           NAS and NAGB would determine the procedure for conducting the equating studies.
           Interested states or commercial test publisher would volunteer to participate in equating
            studies
           The studies would be conducted during 1998 and 1999
           NAGB would review the results of the studies and determine w~ich tests could
            appropriately be equated to the national tests.
