                            DATE:          March 27, 1997
                            LOCATION:      Oval Office
                            BRIEFING TIME: 11:30 am - 12:00 pm
                            EVENT TIME:    12:00 pm - 12:30 pm
                            FROM:          Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      You will be announcing several new steps to encourage women to undergo regular
      mammograms beginning at age 40 as recommended by the National Cancer Institute in a
      morning press conference. This will highlight your continued commitment to making
      mammograms more readily available to women of all ages and the Administration's
      ongoing efforts to prevent, detect and treat breast cancer more effectively.

II.   BACKGROUND

      At !0:30am on Thursday, the Presidentially appointed National Cancer Advisory Board
      appointed will announce that they are now recommending mammograms every one or
      two years for women in their forties. At this press conference, Richard Klausner, the
      Director of the National Cancer Institute, will also announce that he is accepting their
      recommendations. Since 1993, the National Cancer Institute has not recommended
      regular mammograms for women in their forties; the decision had been left up to women
      and their doctors.

      This decision by the National Cancer Institute means there is now consensus among the
      medical community on regular mammogram screening. However, the American Cancer
      Society recommends screening every year and the National Cancer Institute is
      recommending them every one or two years.

      You will be responding to these new recommendations by the medical community by
      announcing the following steps that will expand access to women in their forties to
      annual mammograms and provide clearer educational information to women on this
      issue:


            MEDICARE LEGISLA nON - You will announce that you are sending your
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversioil

                Medicare legislation to Congress that will expand Medicare coverage to include
                annual mammograms for women age 40 and over with no copayment or
                deductible requirement. This was announced in your budget proposal in February
                but is being amended only in the area of reducing the age to 40 years old.
                Currently, Medicare provides coverage for mammogram screenings to women
                ages 40 to 49 every other year.

               MEDICAID
                You will be announcing that the Health Care Financing Administration is sending
                a letter to state Medicaid directors to urge states to provide annual mammography
                screening to Medicaid beneficiaries at age 40, and to assure them that HCF A will
                continue to provide federal matching payments for annual mammography
                screening services.

               FEDERAL EMPLOYEES
                You will announce that you are directing the Office of Personnel Management to
                require all federal health benefits plans to comply with the National Cancer
                Advisory Board's recommendations on mammogram screenings beginning next
                year.

               PUBLIC INFORMA nON CAMPAIGN
                You will announce that the Administration is launching a public education
                campaign to provide information to women about breast cancer screening.
                Secretary Shalala will announce in her remarks that the J-800-4-CANCER hotline
                will begin immediately to provide information consistent with the
                recommendations of the National Cancer Institute.

               CHALLENGE TO PRIVATE SECTOR HEALTH PLANS
                You will call on the private sector health plans to follow your lead in making
                federal health plans consistent with the National Cancer Institute's
                recommendations by covering annual mammograms at age 40 .
