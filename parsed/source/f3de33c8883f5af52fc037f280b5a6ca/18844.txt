MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                   Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                 Meeting with Senator Domenici


       As you know, we are continuing to lay the groundwork for a possible bipartisan summit
to negotiate comprehensive tobacco legislation. We are (1) attacking Republican plans to enact
piecemeal legislation; (2) praising comprehensive bills, such as Senator Conrad's, which meet the
President's principles; and, (3) holding one-on-one meetings with key House and Senate
Members.

Talking Points

       Senator Domenici has proposed that any tobacco funds should "go towards keep the
Medicare system solvent, not new Washington spending." His gave GOP radio address on
February 7th on this topic saying "We should save Medicare first." This is obviously in conflict
with our budget, which provides unrestricted funds to states as well as nearly $15 billion in child
care and education block grants.

       We want to work with Senator Domenici to ensure that the budget resolution he crafts
does not limit all tobacco spending to Medicare. To that end, we could say:

                The President believes it is critical that we enact comprehensive, bipartisan
                 legislation to dramatically reduce teen smoking this year.

                Obviously, there are many members of Congress have different ideas about how
                 tobacco funds should be spent. We think it is critical that we leave our options
                 open while the remainder of the tobacco bill is being debated.

                Thus, we urge you to propose a budget resolution that does not limit tobacco
                 spending to certain categories, but has enough flexibility to allow these decisions
                 be made as part of a larger legislative package. Restricting our spending options
                 may make it more difficult for us to gamer enough votes to enact comprehensive
                 tobacco legislation.
Background                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

       On September 17th, President Clinton announced the five key principles that must be
included in any comprehensive tobacco legislation. They are:

              1. Tough penalties and price increases to reduce youth smoking. Price
              increases of up to $1.50 if necessary over the next ten years.

              2.Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products, including authority
              of the manufacture, sale, and advertising of tobacco products.

              3. The tobacco industry must change the way it does business, including
              stopping advertising to children.

              4. There needs to be progress towards other public health goals including
              cutting second-hand smoke and increasing funding for health research and
              cessation programs.

              5. There should be protection for tobacco farmers and their communities so
              they do not suffer economically because of this legislation.
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                   Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                Meeting with Senator McCain

        As you know, we are continuing to lay the groundwork for a possible bipartisan summit
to negotiate comprehensive tobacco legislation. We are (1) attacking Republican plans to enact
piecemeal legislation; (2) praising comprehensive bills, such as Senator Conrad's, which meet the
President's principles; and, (3) holding one-on-one meetings with key House and Senate
Members.

Talking Points

        Senator McCain is planning to start marking up a bill next week, and he would like to
report a bill out of the Commerce Committee by March 18th. He is starting with S. 1415,
McCain's bill codifying the Attorneys' General settlement. His staff tells us they would like to
produce a bill that we would support, and we are providing him with advice and technical
assistance (as you know, we responded last week to 74 written questions they sent us).

        We should start by reiterating the President's commitment to working on a bipartisan
basis on this issues. We should then make clear that there are five key provisions that must be
in his bill in order to gain Administration support:

                 1. Tough penalties and price increases to reduce youth smoking. Price
                 increases of up to $1.50 if necessary over the next ten years.

                 2.Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products. Nicotine is a drug.
                  Its use in a product needs to be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

                 3. The tobacco industry must change the way it does business, including
                 stopping advertising to children.

                 4. There needs to be progress towards other public health goals including
                 cutting second-hand smoke and better funded programs to help people quit
                 smoking.

                 5. There should be protection for tobacco farmers and their communities so
                 they do not suffer economically because of this legislation.
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conv2iSion

        Senator McCain will likely as our views about liability limits. Our understanding is that
he is not eager to be the first to propose limits, and that he may be seeking ways to avoid
addressing these issues in the Commerce Committee. To these questions, we can say:

      We would prefer not to have liability limits either, but we have said they are not a
       dealbreaker because we think the most important thing is to get a comprehensive bill that
       raises the costs of cigarettes substantially, imposes tough penalties on companies that sell
       to kids, and reaffirms the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products.
