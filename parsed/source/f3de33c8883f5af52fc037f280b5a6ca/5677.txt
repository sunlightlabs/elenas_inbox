                       National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy

Possible event April 30. 1998
The Campaign is planning several events in Washington at the end of April to kick off Teen
Pregnancy Prevention month in May. The Campaign's board will meet Wednesday, April 29th.
There will be an honoree dinner that evening to acknowledge no more than 12 organizations
doing good things to prevent teen pregnancy (similar to last year, but fewer honorees). Thursday
April 30th is available for some kind of event and the Campaign would welcome the
participation of the President or First Lady. The Campaign will be highlighting the theme that
parents/adults matter in reducing teen pregnancy. Sarah Brown is giving this more thought, but
in the meantime, possible options include:

1) White Bouse reception for honorees with President and/or First Lady (similar to last year).

2) Event with media leaders who commit to do something concrete in support of the Campaign,
i.e. air a show highlighting the issue, work it in as a theme in soap operas, do PSAs, etc.
Campaign staff have been meeting with various industry folks and this could be used to both
thank those who have gotten on board and inspire others to do so.

3) Release the following Campaign publications (could be at the White House or at a local
school):
      Research report on impacts of parentiadult-involvement in adolescent sexual risk taking
      Resource guide for parents on how they can get involved and where they can get
       information.

4) Release toolkit for states and communities on addressing teen pregnancy. This is funded
by ASPE. (It might take some reprioritizing for this to be ready for release on 4/30).

5) Unveil posters highlighting the 'parents matter' theme.

An event could probably be structured to include any combination of the above items.
Update on Campaign Activities
The Campaign has organized around five major issues.

1) Leadership--to draw new groups into the effort.
Past activities include:
       Meeting with Youth Development Organizations to highlight research on the
        effectiveness of comprehensive youth development programs in reducing teen pregnancy.
       Establishing House and Senate Advisory groups. Key members include Senators
        Lieberman and Snowe. These groups have commissioned a paper on lessons about the
        impact of media campaigns (on other public health issues).
Future activities:
       Senate group will release above report on media campaigns (probably at National Press
        Club).
       Meeting with religious leaders sometime in 1998.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
2)State and Local Involvement
Past activities:
       Establish state and local advisory committee
       Serve as resource for state and local activities including sending speakers to events,
        sending materials, and brokering information among communities.
       Recently released 'Partners in Prevention' directory of assistance that national
        organizations can provide to state and local communities.
Future activity:
       Publish tool kit for state and local communities. ASPE is funding this, is involved in
        reviewing it during development, and has final review. The Campaign has developed an
        outline and commissioned authors for 13 sections/topics. Deadline to get final draft to
        ASPE is 4/15/98 ..

3) Media
Past/current activities:
      Convened 41 states to discuss their use of media in preventing teen pregnancy. A report
       called 'Sending the Message' has just been published that summarizes the meeting and
       serves as a resource guide.
      Campaign staff is working closely with TV producers and directors, as well as media
       company CEOs to brief them on the issue and engage them in various ways. BET has
       done 2 town summits, with 2 more planned; NBC has committed to do a More you Know
       series on teen pregnancy.
Future activities:
      Briefing for ABC soap opera writers in NY and CA.
      Anne Moore, President of People, has invited First Lady to speak to meeting of girls and
       women's magazines.
      Briefing for writers and producers of 6 major shows (including ER and Friends) in
       June/July to give them ideas to incorporate into Fall scripts.
      Trying to engage Whoopi Goldberg (she's on the Campaign board) -- may propose a TV
       special.

4) Religion and Public Values--to think through and help communities deal with the tough
Issues.
Future activities:
       Releasing paper on what people are arguing about in the teen pregnancy field.
       Facilitate community dialogues--lsfone scheduled for San Bernadino in mid-March.

                                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
                  Review of data on impact and nature of parental/adult involvement from federally-funded
                   Adolescent Health study.

            Also holding series of round tables with follow-up publications. Report on Involving Men and
            Boys has just been released, round table on the Culture of Girlhood held last week, and round

            The Campaign will also do some polling, particularly on parental/adult involvement, with the
            idea of releasing data in conjunction with late April events.
