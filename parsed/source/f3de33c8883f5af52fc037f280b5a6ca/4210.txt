            MEETING WITH LEADERS OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY

                            DATE:September 10,1997
                            LOCATION: Cabinet Room
                            TIME:      11:00 AM to 12:15 PM
                            FROM:      Maria Echaveste
                                       Bill White
                                       Diana Fortuna
I    PURPOSE

     To discuss policy issues affecting people with disabilities.

II   BACKGROUND

     You are meeting 13 national leaders from the disability community as part of your
     continuing effort to hear directly from key constituencies. The following are the primary
     issues that will be raised at the meeting: the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),
     Supplemental Security Income eligibility for children (551 Kids), personal assistant
     services (CASA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and
     employment for people with disabilities. Also in the room will be five of your top
     appointees with disabilities, who have been included because of their substantive
     knowledge and credibility within the disability community.

     After your opening statement, Justin Dart will set the tone for the meeting and
     congratulate you for your past leadership on issues important to people with disabilities.
     Justin will assist in moderating the discussion, calling upon 2-3 people to make short
     presentations on each issue. You will make remarks after each issue is presented as
     appropriate (see attached talking points). In addition to Justin, you should give special
     thanks to Fred Fay, Chair of Disability Outreach for Clinton/Gore in '92 and '96, and
     Becky Ogle, Director of Disability Outreach for Clinton/Gore '96. Fred will be joining
     us via phone from Concord, Massachusetts because of a severe disability.

     Although a variety of disability views will be represented, most of the leaders will have a
     civil rights orientation (as opposed to a cure focus), and will be discussing ways to
     empower people with disabilities and assist them in leading independent lives.

     A key agenda item is Supplemental Security Income (551) eligibility for children. Last
     year's welfare law tightened the eligibility standards for childhood disability
                                                                             Hex-Dump ConversIon

      benefits in the SSI program. The disability community has complained that the
      Administration's interpretation ofthe legislation was too restrictive. (Tab 6)

      Attending the meeting will be two representatives from ADAPT (Americans with
      Disabilities for Attendant Programs Today). ADAPT was the group that staged a
      protest at the Georgia Democratic Headquarters on November 4, 1996, and persuaded
      Alexis Herman to commit to a Presidential meeting. While we have agreed to include
      ADAPT in the meeting, we have made it clear that this is not ADAPTs meeting, but a
      meeting with key representatives of the disability community that would have taken place
      with or without the protest. ADAPT will focus on the issue of personal assistant services
      and ask you to endorse the Community Attendant Service Act (CASA). (Tab 7)

      The final major issue concerns next year's funding for the Individuals with Disabilities
      Education Act (IDEA). The Republicans have skillfully pulled money from parts of
      your new education initiatives and given it to IDEA Advocates are upset about our
      position that we should stick with our original budget proposal. (Tab 8)

      This will be your last event with Bruce Vladeck as HCFA Administrator. You will do a
      short photo-op with Bruce and his wife Fredda Vladeck before the pre-brief.

                  TIPS ON TALKING TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES


The disability community has a number of sensitivities about language and behavior pertaining to
people with disabilities. They are leaders in the emerging civil rights movement for this
community, and see this movement as being perhaps 20 years behind African Americans or
women in terms ofthe degree of understanding and sensitivity of the non-disabled community.
They believe that denigrating language and behavior is still widely tolerated in our society. In
their view, disability is a natural part oflife and people with disabilities should be viewed
positively, rather than as victims, courageous, or pitied.

The term "people with disabilities" is preferred to "handicapped" or even ''the disabled." They
often say that, in the spirit of "putting people first," you should look first at the person rather than
the disability. People ''use'' a wheelchair rather than "are in" a wheelchair -- or worse yet, "are
confined to" a wheelchair. In general, you should not offer assistance with a basic task such as
opening a door or getting seated unless the person appears unable to do so on his or her own.

The Administration's most prominent appointee with a disability is probably Judy Heumann,
who is Assistant Secretary at Education in charge of special education and vocational
rehabilitation. She played a major role in the development of the independent living movement,
which champions people with disabilities living in the community and with their families, and
has helped many people leave nursing homes. (The community is very much opposed to nursing
homes, viewing them as rarely or never appropriate for people with disabilities.) She is a very
constructive internal advocate.

Bob Williams, who is Commissioner of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities
(ADD), part ofHHS, speaks with a voice machine. When he wishes to speak, he often makes a
noise and begins punching into the machine. The etiquette is that other conversations should
continue until the artificial voice begins to speak, and then wait until the thought is expressed.
Bob is a very thoughtful individual who has also been a leader in the disability movement.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA, which governs special education) are viewed as virtually sacred by the community. The
Administration has been extremely strong in supporting these laws. In 1994, the community
was very fearful that the Republican takeover of Congress would lead to attempts to weaken
these laws. The threat never materialized into proposed legislation, but the community believes
it must be ever-vigilant in defending these laws.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

                                 WELCOMING REMARKS


o   Welcome to the Cabinet Room of the White House. Joining me today are several key
    members of my Administration, including Maria Echaveste, who directs my Public
    Liaison Office, Chris Jennings, my senior health care advisor, Administrator Brqce
    Vladeck from HCFA, my friend Tony Coelho from the President's Committee on
    Employment for People with Disabilities, Judy Heumann from the Department of
    Education, Susan Daniels from SSA, Marca Bristo from the National Council on
    Disability, and Bob Williams from HHS.

o   I understand that people with disabilities are not looking for special treatment, but equal
    access to the American dream. I understand the importance of integrating disability
    issues into all policies and programs of the Administration. We couldn't have gotten this
    far without the support of so many of you around this table today.

o   On critical civil rights laws, we have vigorously enforced the ADA, and we have
    defended it from malicious attacks. This year, with the critical assistance of Assistant
    Secretary Judy Heumann we secured the reauthorization of the IDEA in a manner that
    reaffirms our nation's commitment to children with disabilities and their parents.

o   On the key issue of health care for people with disabilities, we haven't gotten as far as I
    would have liked, as you know. But we fought hard and won our fight to preserve the
    Medicaid guarantee, when it was under attack in 1995 and 1996, a change that would
    have been so dangerous for people with disabilities, among many others.

o   As part of the balanced budget I just signed, we restored SSI benefits to over 300,000
    legal immigrants with disabilities. Most observers predicted that Congress would never
    agree to amend the welfare law to make this change, but we were able to persuade them
    with your help. As you know, we made people with disabilities our top priority for
    restorations.

o   But I also know how far we have to go. There are areas where we can and must do more,
    and I'm looking forward to a substantive discussion.

o   Before we begin, I want to give special recognition to Fred Fay who is joining us via
    speaker phone from his home in Concord, Massachusetts, and Becky Ogle, who worked
    night and day organizing the disability community both in '92 and '96.

o   Justin, why don't you lead us off.

                                    ADA ENFORCEMENT

Advocates Who Will Discuss:
     Fred Fay, Chair, DNC Disability Advisory Committee
    Ms. Debbie Robinson, Speaking for Ourselves

What Advocates Will Say:
     The ADA is so critical to the disability community. We appreciate your strong support
     for it. We encourage the Administration to increase its enforcement efforts.

ADA Talking Points:
    Vigorous enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has been a top
     priority of my Administration. The Justice Department, the EEOC, and other federal
     agencies have established aggressive enforcement programs. We have emphasized
     voluntary compliance, but have not been afraid to litigate when entities fail to comply
     with the law.

      Although we have been quite successful, we all know we have a long way to go. Our
       resources are not sufficient to address the majority of meritorious complaints received in
       a timely fashion.

      My budgets have consistently called for an increase for ADA enforcement at the
       Department of Justice. However, the Congress has failed to approve these increases,
       which is indirectly weakening the important law.

                     FY 1998: 5% ($477,000)
                           FY 1997: 3.9% ($361,000)

      I am committed to significantly increasing ADA enforcement resources in the FY 1999
       budget I will submit to Congress early next year. This Administration recognizes
       additional resources are necessary to strengthen a comprehensive enforcement program
       that seeks to achieve greater access for persons with disabilities at home, in their
       communities, and in the workplace. [DOl's request to OMB calls for a 19% increase of
       $2,173,000.]

      The ADA became law because your organizations, both nationally and at the grassroots
       level, worked together to educate the Congress on why the law was urgently needed.
       You won because you were well-organized and persistent. I will fight for greater
       funding, but the only way to make this a reality is if the disability community can make
       this a priority with the Congress.
                                                                                   Yex-Dump Conversion

                 INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT

Advocates Who Will Discuss:
     Nancy Diehl, Parent Network on Disability
     John Harper, Student with a Disability

Background: IDEA was reauthorized in June of this year, after an elaborate bipartisan process
led by Senator Lott that reconciled all the competing interests of schools, parents, teachers, and
others. The Administration has been extremely supportive of the disability community on
IDEA.
However, advocates are upset that we oppose the Senate's large increases in IDEA funding. The
Senate funds IDEA at the expense of Administration priorities (Goals 2000 and America Reads).
 We said in a recent SAP that IDEA is adequately funded at our requested level, and that the
Senate should redirect funds to our priorities. Advocates have misread that SAP to say that we
consider IDEA a "low priority program." The Administration has proposed an increase of
$174 million, while the House has proposed $300 million and the Senate over $900 million.

What Advocates Will Say:
    Thank you for your leadership on IDEA reauthorization. It is critical to our kids' futures.

IDEA Talking Points:
    The passage of the IDEA was a tremendous success for the Administration. The
     bipartisan approach used during reauthorization enabled us to produce a bill which will
     help to ensure that disabled children across this country can get a quality education. Our
     principle from the beginning has been that ALL children must be able to take advantage
     of the educational reforms occurring across this country. Your active support to ensure
     that this legislation is effectively understood and implemented is critical.

IDEA Funding Controversy: Is IDEA a low priority for the Administration given language
included in the SAP on the House and Senate Labor-HHS appropriations bills?

      Special education funding has and always will be a high priority for this Administration.
       In fact, for the first three budgets of this Administration, Congress funded Special
       Education programs at levels less than I proposed. Only recently has Congress come
       around to match or exceed my requests. Because of our leadership, IDEA funding has
       risen by $1.1 billion, a 36% increase during this Administration.

      The Administration will work closely with Congress to ensure a balanced education
       funding bill that makes new investments in a broad range of important education
       programs, including Special Education programs.

      Finally, IDEA is about much more than funding levels. The Administration worked long
       and hard with the disability community, the Congress, parents and schools, to construct a
       reauthorization bill w~ich would ensure that children with disabilities receive a quality
       education. We think that this has been accomplished, and the Administration's funding
       request will complement this effort.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

         SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME ELIGIBILITY FOR CHILDREN

Advocates Who Will Discuss:
      Paul Marchand, the Arc; Chair, Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities

Background: The welfare refonn law set a stricter definition of disability for children's SSI, after
media reports that children faked disabilities to get benefits, and concerns that the program tripled in
size since 1989 to one million children. The new law explicitly eliminated an eligibility test that
allowed many children with less severe disabilities to qualify for the program, particularly mental
disabilities. Estimates at the time were that 180,000 children would lose benefits. After the law
was signed, Senators Conrad, Chafee, and Daschle alleged that SSA had legal authority to recreate
the old test via regulation, cutting off only 35,000 children. SSA ultimately determined that doing
so was contrary to congressional intent and the bipartisan understanding at the time. SSA's
regulation had modest changes that brought the impact down to 135,000 children.

SSA is now more than half-way through reevaluations of the cases of 270,000 children. Over
100,000 children have lost eligibility to date. The final number of children cut off is expected to be
close to SSA's estimate of 135,000. However, advocates allege SSA is discouraging appeals and is
not implementing the new standard consistently across the country. (Mississippi has a termination
rate of over 80%, while California and Pennsylvania are just over a third.)

What Advocates Will Say:
     Your administration chose an unnecessarily tough standard when interpreting Congress's
     intent to tighten up on this program. Advocates have suggested more modest changes to
     SSA's regulation. SSA should stop the cutoffs to consider and respond to these suggestions.

       In SSA's reviews, disturbing trends have emerged. Few families are appealing SSA's
       decisions. SSA may be discouraging appeals. SSA should stop and ensure that families
       have all the rights and infonnation they are entitled to.

SSI Kids Talking Points:
      I know that Acting Commissioner Callahan met with advocates (including the Arc) last
      week to discuss this. We appreciate your constructive involvement in this critical process.

       I am pleased that, as part of the balanced budget, we were able to grandfather Medicaid
       benefits for all these children, so that none of them will lose health insurance.

       I fought against the SSI block grant and other proposals that would have been far worse than
       what we ended up with.

       When the law was enacted, SSA examined the evidence and interpreted the law to create a
       standard that was consistent with her best reading of congressional intent. SSA does not
       believe that a more liberal interpretation is legally possible.

       I know SSA is committed to ensuring these reviews are conducted fairly. I have asked
       Commissioner Callahan to report to me on the concerns you are raising within 30 days.

                        PERSONAL ASSISTANT SERVICES

 Advocates Who Will Discuss:
     Gina MacDonald, National Center for Independent Living ("nickel")
     Bob Kafka and Mike Oxford, ADAPT

Background: ADAPT believes that people with disabilities are "imprisoned" in nursing
homes because Medicaid is biased against home and community-based services. Today,
states limit these services through waivers that cap the number of participants, while
nursing home eligibility is more open-ended.

CASA: ADAPT will push for your support of their bill, the Medicaid Community
Attendant Services Act. CASA requires states to cover community-based attendant
services for those now eligible for nursing home care. It also gives beneficiaries a
greater say in how those dollars are spent. Under pressure from ADAPT, Speaker
Gingrich introduced CASA in June without endorsing it, instead calling it a "starting
point" for an important dialogue and noting it has cost implications. Rep. Gephardt has
also signed on as a co-sponsor. (CASA is not the highest priority of other disability
groups, some of which have specific reservations about it.)

The Administration has not taken a position on CASA prior to this meeting. We have
two major concerns about it. First, although it has a spending cap, CASA would have
significant costs. It would require services for as many as one million people who now
live at home but are so severely disabled that they could qualifY for nursing home care.
Further, any nursing home beds vacated by those moving to the community are likely to
be filled promptly. Second, giving beneficiaries control of significant Medicaid dollars
raises critical questions about quality standards, fraud, and whether Medicaid should pay
family members for care.

Although we can't support CASA, we can support CASA's principles while recognizing
our serious concerns. In response to a June meeting with ADAPT, HHS just formed a
work group to identifY next steps, including working with states on demonstrations of
these principles. Finally, you can inform the group that you are writing Speaker
Gingrich to layout your position on CASA.

Date Certain: Recognizing that CASA raises these concerns, ADAPT is now pushing a
more immediate fallback option. Known as the "date certain" concept, it would allow all
individuals who are actually in nursing homes as of a certain date to move to community
settings if they wish. While this approach solves some of CASA's problems, it would
still cost money since the nursing home beds would be filled by new patients.

What Advocates Will Say:
     People with disabilities are dying in nursing homes, and incremental steps are not
      enough. We urge you to support CASA, or at least a "date certain" policy.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
Personal Assistant Services Talking Points:

      As many of you know, this is an issue that I have cared about for a long time, and
      I am pleased that we have made the progress we have made_

      My Administration has made it easier than ever for states to get waivers for home
      and community-based services. About a quarter of a million people are now
      served in these programs, and HCFA is continuing to push states to make these
      services available.

      Because of a meeting with ADAPT in June, HHS has a new work group that is
      working with you. By the end of the year, it will complete its policy review to
      identify provisions that contribute to Medicaid's institutional bias. It will also
      work with states to develop demonstrations of the principles of CAS A, and I have
      asked them to report to me by the end of February with an action plan.

      I am also asking the work group to examine linking the need for more qualified
      attendants with state welfare reform work requirements under TANF. Linking
      the needs of people with disabilities for attendants and the needs of low-income
      families for jobs seems to be well worth pursuing.

      Although Bruce Vladeck, who has been instrumental in this process as HCFA
      Administrator, is leaving the Administration shortly, I am pleased that Bob
      Williams [who is in the room] will playa key role in this process. Bob has just
      been named Deputy Assistant SecretarY at HHS.

      I strongly support the principles of CAS A but, as you know, it appears that the bill
      would have significant costs. In addition, there are unanswered questions about
      quality, particularly if one were to move quickly toward consumer-directed
      models that are at this point untested. Nevertheless, I want to send a strong
      signal that I believe CASA is an excellent vehicle for discussing our mutual goals
      and allowing us to move forward on them. Therefore, I plan to send a letter to
      Speaker Gingrich applauding his action in introducing CASA, and seeking to
      work with him and others on this.

      [If you are pushed on the "date certain" concept:] My understanding is that the
      date certain concept would also increase Medicaid costs. However, the work
      group is committed to working with states on demonstrations of this idea, along
      with others.
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
                    EMPLOYMENT OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

Advocates Who Will Discuss:
      Tony Coelho, Chair, President's Cmte. on Employment of People with Disabilities
      Paul Edwards, American Council of the Blind

Background: The unemployment rate of people with severe disabilities is 75%. The disability
community argues that we must focus on barriers to work that prevent people with disabilities
from working. These problems include eventual loss of Medicaid or Medicare if they return to
work and high costs for personal assistants, computer accommodations, and transportation.

Medicaid Buy-in: The balanced budget included a President's budget proposal to help people
with disabilities work without losing their health care coverage. Today people on SSI who go to
work lose Medicaid if their earnings exceed caps that vary by state. Since it is so difficult for
people with disabilities to get private insurance, many people who are eligible for SSI "manage"
their income to ensure that they keep Medicaid --by stopping work when they hit the caps, or
turning down promotions. This new state option will allow SSI beneficiaries with disabilities
who earn more than these caps to keep Medicaid by contributing to the cost of their coverage as
their income rises.

SSI Ticket Proposal: The President's budget included a proposal to let SSDI and SSI
beneficiaries choose their own rehabilitation providers. Providers who help beneficiaries leave
the rolls and return to work would be paid a percentage of the disability benefits saved. Because
providers would be rewarded for results rather than for their costs, this should encourage more
providers to have a continuing interest in their clients' long tenn success, which in tum may lead
to more beneficiaries returning to work. Republicans and Democrats on the Hill have put forth
similar proposals (Rep. Bunning proposed this concept before we did), so there is hope of action.

Note: The Administration's appointees with disabilities, led by Tony Coelho, are urging us
internally to issue an executive order that would make this issue a priority and set up a task force
to identify further actions to solve this problem.

What Advocates Will Say:
     We appreciate the Administration's efforts on this issue. However, more must be done.
     The most critical area is health care. Treasury should seriously consider offering tax
      credits to people with disabilities, who so often face higher costs.

Employment Talking Points:
     A large and growing number of people with disabilities can work, and want to work, but
     they face a variety of complex barriers to work. That's why I'm so pleased that our
     proposal for a Medicaid buy-in for people with disabilities was accepted by the Congress
     as part of the balanced budget. In addition, I arn hopeful that bipartisan interest in the
     "ticket" proposal, to increase the number of people with disabilities who can return to
     work, will lead to legislative action soon.

       Nevertheless, we must do more. My Administration continues to be actively engaged in
       identifying further steps we can take, as Tony knows.
