Education Talking Points for NGA Annual Meeting

1. Making K-12 Education System Among the Best in the World

      Working with the Congress, last year we made an historic investment to help families pay
       for college. As a result, we have now opened the doors to college wide, and made it
       possible for two years of college to be as universal by the next century as high school
       graduation is today.

      Now we must make sure that our students are academically prepared to take advantage of
       this opportunity. That is why in my budget for this year I have proposed an ambitious
       agenda to help make our K-12 education system among the best in the world. Our
       efforts here at the national level are designed to support and build upon your efforts in the
       state to raise standards, raise expectations and raise accountability.

      This year I am proposing:

Programs Funded Through States
     A National Effort to Reduce Class Size. I have proposed a national effort to reduce
      class size to a national average of 18 in grade 1-3, to give our students the trained
      teachers, individual attention and more disciplined environment that will help them learn
      to read well and get a good grounding in the basics. This $12.4 billion initiative over 7
      years ($7.3 over 5 years) will provide the funds to help local school districts hire 100,000
      well prepared teachers.

      Modern School Buildings to Improve Student Learning. I have also proposed a $22
       billion school modernization initiative to help states and local communities provide the
       space for smaller classes, repair and renovate crumbling schools, and build new schools.

Competitive Programs (or High Poverty Urban and Rural Communities
    Education Opportunity Zones: Helping Students in Poor Communities Reach High
     Standards. My initiative would provide funds to high poverty urban and rural school
     systems with a track record of improving student achievement. I want to invest in school
      systems that are serious about raising standards, and will end social promotions,
     intervene in failing schools, and provide choice throughout the public schools. These
     education opportunity zones can provide a model to the nation in how our urban school
      systems can work.

      High Hopes for College. To inspire more of our young people to have high
       expectations, to stay in school and study hard, and to go to college, I have proposed a new
       initiative that would promote partnerships between colleges and middle or junior high
       schools in low income communities. This initiative would let students and their families
       know that there is enough financial aid available to make college is affordable, would let
       students know what it means and what it takes to go to college, and provide them with the
       mentoring and support services needed to keep them on track.
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

   Attracting and Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers. I have proposed a $350 million
    initiative to attract talented people into teaching at low-income schools, and to
    dramatically improve the quality of training and preparation given to our future teachers.
    This new initiative will help bring nearly 35,000 outstanding new teachers into
    high-poverty urban and rural areas, through partnerships between institutions of higher
    education and local schools in inner city and poor rural areas.
                          Education Q&A for NGA Roundtable             Hex-Dump Conversion


QUESTION: We are very concerned about your proposals to use tobacco settlement funds
          for your national initiatives. How will you support flexibility on how the
          funds can be used between health care, child care, and class size reduction?

ANSWER:      Elena-/ need your guidance on this one.



QUESTION: Is the voluntary national test dead? If not, how do you plan to move the
          proposal forward.

ANSWER:      The testing proposal is very much alive and moving forward. Last Fall, Congress
             appropriated funds for continued development of the tests, and endorsed my
             proposal to place the independent, bipartisan NAGB in charge of the tests.
             NAGB has taken charge and is moving forward. I will continue to work with the
             Congress to secure funding and support for test development and implementation,
             and I will veto any effort to stop work from moving forward. At the same time, I
             am open to other approaches to accomplishing the objective of measuring
             individual student learning in the basics against national standards--such as using
             existing state tests that can be linked to NAEP,.and would urge NAGB,
             ACHIEVE and the governors to pursue this.


QUESTION: You have proposed new federal education initiatives for school construction,
          class size reduction, school mentoring, urban education and other areas.
          Yet, you haven't proposed any increased funding for IDEA, the biggest
          unfunded federal mandate in education. At the same time, the Education
          Department is proposing burdensome new rules, which go beyond the intent
          of the bill you signed into law last year. Will you work with us to ensure
          that the Special Education rules will not be unduly burdensome? Will you
          consider scaling back your new initiatives and putting the funds into special
          education--so that we at the state and local level can have more control over
          how we spend our own money?

ANSWER:      The special education law I signed last year provides states and school districts
             with significantly more flexibility than did the previous law. It will reduce
             paperwork, reporting requirements and litigation. It places a stronger emphasis
             on results. And it protects the safety of all students in the classroom while
             retaining the essential rights and protections of disabled students. The Education
             Department has proposed regulations to carry out the law, and has received quite
             a few comments back. I am sure Secretary Riley will review those comments
             carefully before issuing final regulations.
             three years, a substantial increase in the investment the federal government has
             made in helping states and local communities pay for special education services ..

             While we have not proposed additional increases in special education, a number
             of other initiatives we have proposed will help address the needs of special
             education. Our class size reduction initiative will help students with disabilities
             main streamed in regular classes get the extra attention they need, and should
             reduce costs that occur when students who mainly need extra help are instead
             wrongly identified as requiring special education services. In addition, our
             school modernization initiative will help schools make the accommodations to
             their facilities necessary for students with disabilities.

QUESTION: Will you support block grant legislation so that states can have more
          flexibility in the use of federal education funds, and not be constrained by the
          requirements of separate categorical programs?

              I will look carefully at the block grant proposal NGA has developed.

             Most federal education funding is in a handful of programs with clearly defined
             and important purposes, such as providing extra help to disadvantaged or disabled
             students, training teachers, raising academic standards, helping states start charter
             schools and helping school use technology. Within these purposes, I am in favor
             of providing maximum flexibility in our programs, along with accountability for
             results.

             Since Secretary Riley and I have taken office, we have worked hard to increase
             the flexibility and reduce the regulatory burden in federal education programs.
             We have eliminated 67 percent of the pages of regulations that govern major
             elementary and secondary education programs, and have run Goals 2000 and
             School-to-Work without issuing a single new regulation. We have approved
             almost 250 waiver requests from 49 states, and through the Ed-Flex program have
             granted 12 states the ability to waive federal requirements on their own. As I
             indicated earlier, I am prepared to ask Congress for the authority to grant Ed-Flex
             to all 50 states.


                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
