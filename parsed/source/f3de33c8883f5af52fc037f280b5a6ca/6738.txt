MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  BRUCE REED
                       MIKE COHEN
                       SECRETARY RILEY


SUBJECT:               California Proposition 227 (Unz Initiative) to end Bilingual Education


         On June 2, California voters will consider Proposition 227, English for the Children, an
initiative which proposes to eliminate all bilingual education and require that all students be
taught in English, regardless of their primary language or level of English comprehension. This is
California's third potentially divisive race-related initiative in four years, following on the heels
of Proposition 187 which barred public benefits for illegal immigrants, and Proposition 209
which ended affirmative action.

          Latino activists are strongly opposed to Unz, and are looking to the White House for
.strong and visible support of their efforts to defeat Unz. Polls consistently show that the
 initiative is popular, even among Latino voters, and is likely to pass. While many expect Latino
 support to decline considerably as voters become more familiar with the details of the proposal, it
 is clear that the initiative taps frustration with highly publicized problems in some bilingual
 education programs as well as widespread dissatisfaction over the performance of the public
 schools, particularly with regard to Hispanic students.

       Despite legitimate concerns over the ineffectiveness of some bilingual education
programs as they are currently implemented in many places in California and throughout the
country, your advisors strongly believe that the Unz initiative is bad education policy and will be
harmful to students who need help the most. Despite some tricky politics, we believe that it is
both good policy and good politics to oppose Unz, coupled with proposals to "mend, not end"
bilingual education. This memo provides the background, rationale, and specific
recommendations for this approach.

I.      The English for the Children Initiative and Bilingual Education 'in California

A. Overview of English for the Children (Unz) Initiative
        This initiative, authored and backed by Silicon Valley millionaire Ron Unz, is designed to
end all bilingual education programs in California. More specifically, it would:
       Require that all public school instruction be conducted in English.
       Permit thiS requirement to be waived only if parents or guardians can show that the child
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

       already knows English, has special needs, or would learn English faster through an
       alternative instructional technique.
      Provide initial placement for Limited English Proficient (LEP) students in "sheltered
       English immersion" programs for one year. Instruction in these programs would be
       conducted in English, with some accommodations in the curriculum to take into account
       the limited English language skills of the students.
      Appropriate $50 million per year over 10 years to fund adult education programs that
       teach English, to adults who pledge to provide English language tutoring to LEP students.
      Makes teachers, administrators and school board members personally liable for failure to
       implement the provisions of the initiative, and subject to suit by parents or guardians.

     " Unz and other backers of this initiative make clear that they regard the existing system of
bilingual education in the state as a complete failure. They argue that Latino and other
immigrant parents want their children to learn English more rapidly than occurs at present. They
charge that because bilingual education relies so heavily on use of the students' native language
and only slowly introduces English, the approach delays or prevents, rather than promotes, the
acquisition of English. Further, they point out that though California's bilingual education law
expired a decade ago, the legislature has been unable to enact legislation to reform a broken
program. This initiative, they argue, will break the legislative impasse and dramatically change
bilingual education policy for the better.

         Opponents criticize the Unz Initiative on a number of counts. Critics argue that the
initiative is harmful to children, because it relies on a single, unproven approach that provides an
unrealistic time period in which to learn English, and will result in grouping students in the same
classes regardless oflanguage, age or grade level. They argue that the one-size-fits-all approach
eliminates a parent's right to chose the best approach for their child (and point out that the waiver
requirements in the Unz initiative are extremely burdensome and unlikely to be used effectively,
particularly by immigrant parents). They point out that the Unz initiative provides no
accountability, because it lacks any requirements for assessing students' academic progress.
They also point out that the Unz Initiative undermines local control and the ability of local school
boards to determine important education policies, and wrongly subjects educators to lawsuits.

B. The Context of Bilingual Education in California

        Demographics. There are approximately 1.3 million Limited English Proficient (LEP)
students in California, approximately xx% of California's K-12 students.. This number has
nearly doubled in less than a decade, and represents some 43% of the national total. Seventy
nine percent of California's LEP students are native Spanish speakers. Hispanics have a 50%
dropout rate, and by most indicators their academic performance lags behind most other
population groups in the state.

        Educational Services. LEP students receive a wide variety of types of services intended
to help them learn English and academic subjects. In 1997, only approximately 30% receive


                                                 2
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

what is conventionally considered bilingual education--programs which make significant use of
the student's primary language to teach academics while phasing in greater amounts of English
language instruction. Approximately 16% are not receiving any language instruction services at
all. The remainder--more than half-- participate in specially designed. instructional programs
that help students leam English through a combination of approaches such as direct instruction in
grammar, vocabulary and communications, and instruction in academic subjects that is designed
to be accessible to LEP students. The California Department of Education estimates that there is
a shortage of 21 ,000 qualified bilingual education teachers.

         While the rationale for the Unz Initiative is the perceived failure of bilingual education in
California, less thap a third of the eligible students actually participate in it. And the Unz
initiative if enacted would eliminate virtually all of the programs now providing services to LEP
students.

        Significantly, none of the Unz opponents we spoke with in the education or advocacy
communities were prepared to argue that bilingual education, or any other form of services to
LEP students in California, is currently effective on a large scale basis. While program
evaluations show that there are promising efforts using a number of different approaches, in the
main there is a strong sense that shortages of qualified teachers and poor implementation has
limited the effectiveness of many existing programs. In addition, most observers agree that the
overall poor academic performance and high dropout rate of Hispanic students reflects serious
weaknesses in schools that extend well beyond language services for LEP students.

        California Legal Framework. The legal framework for providing services to LEP
students in California is particularly murky. California's Bilingual Education Act sunseted in
1987, though under California law the overall purposes of the program remain in effect, even
while the more specific design, programmatic and administrative features do not. The State
Board of Education regulations implementing the act have remained in effect, and provided the
state legal framework for bilingual education. Under this framework, school districts were
required to help students become fluent in English and competent in other academic subjects, and
were given a significant amount of flexibility in determining how to achieve these goals.
Neither bilingual education nor any other specific approach to teaching LEP students was
required ..

        There have been a number of unsuccessful attempts in the past decade to enact new
legislation, but bilingual education reformers and advocates have been unable to agree on an
approach. There has been a fresh attempt over the past month to craft compromise legislation,
partly to take the steam out ofUnz and partly to give Unz opponents something to be for.
However, it is not clear that longstanding disagreements can be overcome this time. Nor is it
considered likely that Gov. Wilson will sign compromise legislation.

        Last week the California State Board of Education took the first step toward eliminating
the state bilingual education regulations entirely. This process should be completed shortly


                                                  3
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
before the vote on Unz. While neither the motivations behind this step, nor its full implications,
are clear, it appears that the overall impact will be to eliminate any state law or regulations
regarding services to LEP students, and to give local school districts even gre!lter flexibility in
the future than in the past, subject to applicable federal requirements.

       Federal Legal Framework. Federal requirements originate in the Due Process and
Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and provisions of the Equal Educational
Opportunities Act (19XX) which require educational agencies to take appropriate action to
overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by students in instructional programs.

        As interpreted by the courts, these provisions do not require any specific form of services,
such as Bilingual Education or English as a Second Language programs. Rather, they require
the provision of supplemental language instruction that is based on sound educational theory, is
adequately resourced and implemented, and is evaluated and modified as necessary.

        These requirements afford local school districts in California considerable discretion to
fashion programs and services according to their specific needs and resources. Rather than
requiring a specific approach, they require that whatever approach is used be implemented
effectively. IfUnz is enacted, many expect that it will be challenged as a violation offederal
law. However, prior to enactment, there is no basis to support that view. However, if services
mandated by Unz are not implemented effectively, there is likely to be a strong basis for a legal
challenge.

        The federal Bilingual Education program (Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act) is an additional source of federal direction for participating local school districts.
However, this competitive grant program also provides local school districts with considerable
discretion in the type of services provided to students.


II.     Political Context

        The Unz initiative is the clearly the most serious threat to bilingual education, but it is not
likely to be the last such threat. Earlier this year Speaker Gingrich proposed eliminating the
bilingual education, and conservatives from English-only advocates to more serious scholars
troubled by the lack of clear evidence of effectiveness (e.g., Diane Ravitch) have also called for
the elimination of bilingual education. Especially ifUnz passes, we are liKely to see energized
opposition to the federal program, and escalated opposition in other states and local
communities.

         The Unz initiative presents a political dilemma in California. Ifwe oppose it, we
risk alienating a majority of California Anglo voters. If we fail to oppose it, we risk alienating a
vocal and increasingly influential group of Latino leaders, and possibly Latino voters.



                                                  4
                                                                           .        Hex-Dump Conversion


       Current polls show that a majority of all voters, and especially a majority of California
Anglo voters, support Unz. For Anglos, bilingual may become the hot button issue that
immigrant services and affirmative action were. Anglos are angry about spending money on
bilingual education and want it stopped

       In contrast, Latino voters are split on the issue of bilingual education. Latino activists
and electeds oppose Unz. To some of the Latino leaders, this is a litmus issue, like Propositions
187 and 209. It is being viewed as a cultural attack and as racially motivated. Private
conversations and press accounts suggest that Latino leaders are looking to the White House to
become actively involved in the opposition to Unz, and are beginning to become fearful that we
may sit on the sidelines when California considered eliminating educational opportunities for
Latino children, until it is too late, .

          Polls and anecdotal evidence show that show that Latino "voters" currently support
Unz. Latino citizens believe the education system is failing to lift their children up to the
standards of Anglo children. They are frustrated and want a better choice for their children's
education, and this frustration is being translated into support for a proposition that purports to
help their children learn English rapidly. However, most Latino leaders and activists believe
that as Latino voters become better education about the particulars of the Unz initiative, Latino
support will decline considerably.

        More organizations and elected officials are taking positions on Unz. The California
education community has been solidly opposed to Unz, including the California Teachers
Association, the California School Boards Association, and others. Key Democratic
officeholders have also announced their opposition to the Unz initiative. A list of organizations,
elected officials and other leaders that have taken positions is attached.

       The Republican state party, over the objections of the leadership, has supported Unz,
though many Republican officials, including Gov. Wilson, have so far been treating this issue
very carefully and have not taken a position. There is a chance that White House opposition to
Unz could polarize the situation, and push Gov. Wilson and other Republicans into supporting
Um.                                                       
        [Note: We need to determine where the Dem. Gubernatorial candidates, as well as
Feinstein, are]

        The political dilemma can be resolved with a "Mend it / Don't End it" response.
We can strike a middle ground between Latino leaders, possibly Latino voters, and Anglos by
admitting that bilingual education needs mending, but Unz is not the way to do it. More
specifically, we can:
       Start by reiterating the overriding importance of helping every child become proficient in
        English
       Oppose Um on the merits because it is too extreme;
       Remind voters what we are for, including our overall approach to strengthen public

                                                                           Automated Records Management Syslerr'

           education and, within that, our Hispanic initiative aimed largely at increase academic
           achievement and high school completion among Hispanics;
          Propose to "mend" the federal bilingual education program through steps that will
           strengthen local control (and lift the cap on English programs); create expectations for
           learning English within a fixed period of time; strengthen accountability for students and
           programs alike by testing for English proficiency; and promoting our efforts to strengthen
           program quality by increased investments in teacher training.


    III.   Specific Recommendations

    1. Announce opposition to Unz within next 4 weeks

            We recommend that you or another senior Administration official (the Vice President or
    Secretary Riley) announce the Administration's opposition to the Unz initiative within the next
    4 weeks. One advantage of taking a position in the next month is that we have an opportunity
    to take an offensive position and set a polite tone rather than get involved in an inflammatory
    one.     The closer to the election, the more likely this debate will devolve into a mud slinging
    race debate. If our objective is to support effective education for the 21 st Century, we could
    make this an opportunity for fitting bilingual education into that kind of framework.        .

    2. Specific recommendations for changing federal bilingual education program
            In accord with our recommendation for a "mend don't end" approach to bilingual
                                                           ,
    education, we believe that opposition to Unz should be coupled with specific proposals to change
    the federal bilingual education program. This approach will lend credibility to our position, and
    give us a basis for defining the Congressional debate we are anticipating. Specifically, we
    recommend the following changes:

             Strengthen local control by lifting the existing cap on English programs. The current
    program already offers a great deal of flexibility to local school districts in how to approach
    education LEP students. However, it also contains a ceiling that permits only 25% of the funds
    to, be used to support English-only programs. Since most participating school districts use a
    variety of approaches, the cap has not limited local approaches--though it is perceived as having
    that effect. lifting the cap would add credibility to our support for local control in California,
    and would help address the concerns of conservative critics. This approach would be unpopular
    with the bilingual advocacy community.

            Create expectations for students to learn English within 3 years. We should build
    clear expectations into the bilingual education program that schools are expected to help students
    learn English within 3 years. One of the most powerful criticisms of bilingual education

                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
programs is that they in fact prolong the time it takes for students to learn English. This
criticism seems to resonate with many opponents as well as supporters ofUnz. Because there is
neither a strong enough research base nor policy consensus to set a hard and fast timeline for
learning English (as Unz proposes), and because many students will face different individual
circumstances, our approach should simply set a clear expectation.

        Strengthen testing and accountability for students and programs. Programs should
be required to test students for English proficiency (as well as achievement in other subjects) by
the end of the 3-year time frame, and be required to provide additional services or take other
corrective actions as appropriate when students not making adequate progress. There should
also be additional accountability for school districts participating ih the bilingual education
program. Programs are already required to undergo evaluations; this requirement can be
strengthened through administrative steps that would establish consequences, such as possible
withholding of funds, from programs that fail to make adequate progress as measured by student
achievement.

       Underscore existing and increase efforts to strengthen the quality of programs that
provide services to LEP students, regardless of the type of program being offered. Your
budget requests a significant increase in funding for teacher training within the bilingual
education program. This is a critical step to improving the quality of any instructional program
for LEP students, and we should highlight it. We should undertake a vigorous effort, through
technical assistance and effective dissemination approaches, to emphasize that any program for
LEP students must be based on fundamental principles of quality. These principles include:
      students must be taught by well trained teachers
      students must have access to a quality curriculum
      student language skills and content learning must be periodically assessed, and the results
       used to modify instruction
      programs must be evaluated on an ongoing basis to determine effectiveness, and
       modifications made as needed.
