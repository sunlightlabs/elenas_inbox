12:35 P.M. CDT


                 MR. MCCURRY: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and
welcome to St. Louis, Missouri. This is our window to do a little brief, and
so I wanted briefly to have Bruce Reed, Assistant to the President for
Domestic Policy, and Eli Segal, who President of the Welfare To Work
Partnership, talk to you a little bit about the both the President's
announcement today with respect to the welfare caseload numbers, and then some
of the impressive work that the Partnership has been doing to build private
sector support.

               Mr. Reed.

               MR. REED: Thank you, Mike. Let me just say a word about why
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
we're here in St. Louis. The new welfare law has shattered every record on
the books in its rookie year. You should have the welfare caseload numbers --
let me go through them for you to put them in some perspective.

                 In the first three and a half years of the Clinton presidency,
we were able to reduce the welfare rolls by about 1.9 million recipients. The
welfare caseload was 14.1 million when we took over in January of 1993; it had
dropped by 1.9 million when the President signed the bill in August. The new
figures that we're releasing today cover the nine months from August of '96
when he signed the bill to May of '97, which is the latest figures available.
And they show that in the first nine months of the new welfare law, the
welfare caseloads have dropped another 1.45 million, and at its current rate,
the caseload is on course to drop nearly 2 million in the first full year of
the welfare law, which is as much as it dropped in the first three and a half
years of the Clinton presidency.

                 These numbers are a stunning success, totally unprecedented in
the history of welfare. Welfare caseloads have risen almost uninterrupted in
the first 60 years of the program. Before President Clinton took office there
had only been two years where the caseload had dropped by more than 250,000.
And we are about to have our third straight year in which the caseload has
dropped by more than a million. The total is 3.4 million for the first four
years and four months of the Clinton presidency. That's a 24-percent drop,
which again is a record.

             And Eli and I can talk a little bit about why that is
happening. Certainly some of the success is due to a Dooming economy and very
low unemployment. But there's also something

else going on, which is for the first time most states are taking
welfare reform seriously and putting in place impressive programs
to move people from welfare to work.

           It's no accident that some of the states that have
shown the most dramatic drops -- including Wisconsin, where the

drop has been 54 percent; Indiana where the drop has been 45
percent; Tennessee, 47 percent; Massachusetts, 40 percent--
those are all states that received major waivers from the Clinton
administration and that are real leaders in welfare-to-work
efforts.

              The two biggest states that are lagging behind the
rest of the country -- New York, which is 45th in caseload drop,
and California, which is 48th -- have only recently put in place
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
statewide programs. In fact, Governor Wilson just signed
California's program yesterday. And Governor Pataki is scheduled
to sign his new law later this week. So if New York and
California, which together represent about a third of welfare
caseload, have been. dropping at the same rate      as the rest of
the country, we would have seen an additional 750,000 people
moved off of welfare in the last four years.

              I think one other point worth making is that a year
ago when the President signed the bill he promised to fix it in
some important ways, and the new budget law that he just signed
last week does that. He made good on his promise to undo the
harsh cuts in immigrant benefits. The new budget restores $11.5
billion in health and disability benefits to legal immigrants who
are in the country at the time the welfare law was signed. And
it also expands work opportunities for people who are on food
stamps, childless adults who won't get cut off because they'll
now have an opportunity to go to work.

              We were also able to enact a $3 billion
welfare-to-work program that will give money to the hardest-hit
communities, the inner city communities where the
hardest-to-place welfare recipients tend to be concentrated.. And
we expect that that $3 billion, along with a welfare-to-work tax
credit that was included in the new budget, will go a long way
towards meeting the President's goal of moving another million
people from welfare to work.

            Eli.

              MR. SEGAL: Part of the reason that we've seen so
much progress in the last year is because the private sector has
stepped up to the plate since the legislation was signed. The
private sector means a lot of things, but among other things it
means the Welfare To Work Partnership, launched at the request of
the President of the United States at his State of the Union
address this last year. Actually, we began business in May, on
May 20th, at the White House, with 100 partners in the Welfare To
Work Partnership. Today we're over 800, and we expect to reach
our first objective, 1,000, well before the President hoped we
would, which was six months from the event in May.

             The numbers are impressive, but I think as we go
forward, we're going to even be able to produce more information,
which is that not only are companies signing up, not only are
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
they making the commitment to hire and retain, but they're
actually achieving that objective and, in the process, changing
their hiring practices.

              Here in St. Louis today was our first regional
challenge, the first time since we launched in May that we've
actually kind of built around a city the idea of moving a city
around the welfare to work initiative. There are 42,000 people
on the welfare rolls -- 42,000 adults on the welfare rolls here
in the greater St. Louis 12-county area right now. We hope and
expect that our 300-plus companies who have signed up today will
be actively engaged in hiring people over the course of the next
year. We expect to come back and work closely with the people
who, in fact, signed up today and make sure that as we go from
the poetry to the prose of welfare to work we, in fact, get a lot
done.


               We're optimistic. We know there are those who
continue to be skeptical about this, but we already can begin to
report on success stories around the country, companies of
different sizes and shapes who are, in fact, doing this not out
of a sense of corporate citizenship, although we see some of
that, as well, but because of its effect on the bottom line of
companies. At the time of this extraordinarily robust economy.
Companies really do see this as a new source of labor.

              Our essential core message is that welfare to work
is good for business, and we think we're going to be able to
demonstrate that over and over again as we go forward. St. Louis
was first. There will be many other cities in which we operate
going forward. In the course of the next 10 days, as we lead up
to the 22nd and the anniversary of the welfare reform legislation
there will be many other things that the Welfare To Work
Partnership is going to speak to. We're going to show small
business support. We're going to show industry support. We're
going to show support in other states.

              So we're highly optimistic about -- there was some
skittishness a year ago about some anxiety about this great
gamble that the President was taking signing the legislation. I
think we're going to be able to show that the business community
is going to step up to the plate and really make a difference.

             Q    Do you have any actual breakdown of the number
other reasons why they're off the rolls?                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

              MR. SEGAL: We know the following. The welfare
system was designed as an income maintenance system, so there are
no definitive statements of statistics kept at any level of
government -- federal, state or city -- which tracks those moving
from welfare to the private sector. On the other hand, we know
that our own companies will be tracking -- we can't say anything
to it right now; we're just getting off the ground. We wanted to
establish our bona fides as a place to tum for information. I
think over time, we as a bare minimum will certainly be doing it,
and we see some states are beginning to look into tracking
welfare to work. We know it's important to do it, and we're
going to figure out a way to do it. But at this time we cannot
give you specific information.

              We know what commitments of industries are,
commitments of specific companies are. I'm quite comfortable
that when these companies and industries give commitments, they
will live up to them. But I can't tell you right this minute on
our companies, or I can't even tell you how many specifically,
but we will soon.

             Q    You guys don't know -- you know how many people
are dropping from the welfare rolls -- you don't have stats for
how many have dropped or kept dropping?

              MR. REED: No. That's one of the things that we'll
be looking at. The welfare law calls for a work performance
bonus which will reward states that are specially affected in
moving people from welfare to work and keeping them in jobs. And
we'll be tracking that.

              I should say that for the national numbers, the vast
majority of people who have moved from welfare to work over the
last four years have likely done so on their own. The time
limits have not taken effect in the overwhelming majority of the
country. I think a few counties in Florida, and they may be
coming into effect in a few counties in Wisconsin.

             A number of states, both through their waivers and
since the passage of the new law have put into place tougher work
requirements and greater expectations that eventually recipients
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
will need to move into work. And, in fact, many states are
reporting that the very expectation of work has had a significant
impact in reducing their caseloads.

               Q    So are you saying that the law -- the time
limits in the law hasn't had an effect yet?

              MR. REED: The time limits -- no one has reached the
time limits in the new welfare law. There's a five-year lifetime
limit in the welfare law, so nobody's going to reach that until
at least 2001. Other states have put in place shorter periods by
which recipients are required to work. And some people have been
sanctioned for refusing to work. But that isn't the case with
most of the people who are--

            Q      How has the law convinced people or pushed
people off welfare?

              MR. REED: I think that a number of states have
found that expectations for everyone involved in the system have
changed. Welfare case workers are telling recipients or
prospective applicants when they walk in the door that welfare is
no longer an income maintenance system, it's a work system and
that they're going to be required to go to work. Some people
decide not to apply as a result.

              Many states have set up so-called grant diversion
programs where they give people a lump sum for a short period of
time to help them through a tough period, rather than putting
them on the welfare caseload and writing them monthly checks.
And I think there's been -- again, this wil.! be the most studied
social experiment in recent history, so we will know over time
exactly where people are going and why. But I think we're also
going to see a certain amount of smoke-out effect, some people
who were working off the books who have now decided it's not
worth the trouble.

              MR. SEGAL: I have one little comment to that,
anecdotal though it is at this point. In at least one city,
Kansas City, we actually tracked the number of people who were
learning about LINK, which is one of the finest job training and
readiness systems in the United States. Before and after the
signing of the welfare legislation there's a tremendous bump in
the number of people calling for information, coming down and
getting a training program. And we're trying to track some of
that infonnation as well. There are a couple of other examples              Hex-Dump Conversion
like that, as well, that the law has stimulated at least
interest, if not, yes, a change in behavior.

              Q     The infonnation that you're hearing back from
states, are you getting the idea that the flow of people from
welfare into actual jobs is a trickle -- is it a few, is it
thousands? Are they coming off welfare into training, or off
welfare directly into jobs, or off welfare into nothing at all?

             MR. REED: Well, the numbers that we've given you
today are people who have left the welfare caseload altogether.
Most of those people have probably gone to work or gotten
married, so that their income no longer makes them eligible.

             In a number of states, people are still on the
caseload, but also working. Some states allow recipients to stay
on the caseload longer and keep a greater portion of their check.
As I said, we won't know all the facts on this for some time to
come.

             Q     -- how much of the people have dropped off the
rolls because they've gotten married?

             MR. REED: We don't know. Historically, that's been
-- work has been the number one reason and getting married has

been the second.

             But to Eli's point, the pace of people leaving--
the pace of caseload reduction doubled around the time of the
signing of the welfare law and has continued. But it even was
doubling in the months around the signing when nothing else had
really changed -- the states hadn't implemented new programs. So
there probably is a noticeable impact merely from having a
national welfare debate followed by a series of 50 state welfare
debates.

              MR. SEGAL: It's the accumulation of data that we
don't have at this point. At the Welfare To Work Partnership,
when we launched in May, one company, United Airlines, committed
that in the course of the next three years it was going to hire
2,000 people fonnerly on public assistance -- 400 the first year,
800 in each of the next two. They're already hired 247 people at
this point, against their first year's objective of 400.
               One of the problems that we're dealing where with
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
data, is that not only has the law never historically asked
companies, states, counties to hold the data, but there have been
a whole host of privacy reasons and stigmatization reasons why
companies have been reluctant and individuals have been reluctant
to share information about where they were before they began
working here -- working at their current position.

              We believe we're going to be able to figure out some
model to start sharing some information with you that will be
helpful. It's just going to take a little while.

             Q     -- also I think a couple of weeks ago the
President urged states to kind of save that savings to create
jobs during economic downturn. Do you know if they're doing that
and what the status of that is?

               MR. REED: Well, the welfare law gives states a
block grant that is based on peak caseloads back in 1994. So
almost every state that's seen significant caseload reduction is
receiving more money than it would have under the old law. On
average, it's probably about 25 percent more money. In some
states it's going to be a good bit more than that.

              Most states seem to be reinvesting their savings for
a couple of reasons. One is the that law actually requires them
to maintain their prior efforts. And since their prior efforts
were also based on a much higher caseload, they're required to
spend more than they would otherwise be spending now. A number
of states have also decided to plow a lot of money into child
care. California's new law calls for $1.3 billion in child care
a year. Illinois doubled the amount of money that it's spending
on child care. So I think most of the states seem to be doing
the right thing on this.

             Q    Could you talk a little bit more about
California and why it's so far behind?

              MR. REED: I got in trouble the last time I gave an
explanation to this. I think there are a couple of possible
reasons. One is that the economic recovery started later in
California; there's been population growth. And it's quite
possible that the fact that it has taken the state -- that the
state has had a long, protracted debate on the subject of welfare
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
refonn has kept it from putting into place statewide efforts
which will now happen as a result of the new law.

              Q     Can you tell us why Governor Childs and some of
the other governors were wrong, that the portion of the budget
did not -- dealing with federal job protections were fonner
welfare recipients? They suggest that this would deal a severe
blow to welfare. Why is that wrong?


               MR. REED: Well, I think most governors have one
legitimate concern, which is that they are worried that down the
road the Internal Revenue Service will come to the conclusion
that work-fare jobs are taxable income and that recipients would
then be eligible for the earned income tax credit and employers
-- in this case, the state -- would be required to pay FICA taxes
and unemployment insurance. And for a number of states that
would be a significant burden.

               We've made clear to governors in both parties that
 we're prepared to make sure that that doesn't happen. In the
 budget law that just passed, Congress exempted work-fare
 participants from ·the earned income tax credit and we will deal
.with the FICA and unemployment insurance problem as well. I
 think there's less of a real concern -- I think the governors are
 wrong to be concerned about the application of basic employment
 protections which, after all, are standard in the private sector
 and involve basic civil rights protections -- the minimum wage,
 which has always been the tradition in work-fare programs.

              So on the money issue I think they have a legitimate
concern that we can deal with. On the employer protections, I
don't think they're right.

             Q     -- requirements -- see a situation where a
certain welfare programs are really -- by the fact that the
locals say you have to pay a prevailing wage on this project --

            MR. REED: I think it is highly unlikely that you
would see a welfare recipient in a work-fare program where Davis
-Bacon would apply.

             MR. MCCURRY: Other subjects? Any other subjects?
Yes.
              Q     This is sort of the same thing. Missouri and         Hex-Dump Conversion
Illinois, how do they fit into some of this? And why was St.
Louis picked for this stop?

               MR. SEGAL: Came to Missouri for several reasons.
First, we believe its strong economy would be a good place to
make the argument for welfare to work that the companies were
going to have a real need for entry-level work. We can make the
case there. Second, it is a city with one of our five founders,
a corporate champion; Monsanto has been extremely supportive of
all the efforts we've undertaken. And third, it's a city in a
state where the elected and the appointed officials have been
very much engaged in welfare reform from even prior to the
passage of legislation.

               With all of that, we just kind of thought this would
 be a city we could wrap our hands around and tell the story and
 actually start going from the poetry to the prose, I think is the
'essential reason why we did it here.

             Q -- five-year time limits, how many people are
expected to be pushed off, how many jobs --

              MR. REED: Well, there are -- of the 10.7 million
still on welfare, I think that translates into about 3.9 million
adults -- how many people need jobs by the year 2001 depends on
what happens between now and then with continued caseload
reduction. And I think that -- the welfare law calls for state
to meet work participation requirements of 25 percent this year
and it goes up 5 percent a year and reaching 50 percent by 2002.
A number of states can get close to this year's rate just by
their success in caseload reduction alone.

              But there's no question that over the long haul this
is going to continue to be a challenge. As more and more people

move off welfare, the remaining cases get tougher. And that's
why we think that it's especially important to engage the private
sector, which is the long-term route out of this system.

              Q    This fundraiser right now, how much is it
raising?

           MR. MCCURRY: It's raising -- I believe the DNC said
$250,000. I think it's predominantly soft money, but I don't
have the split. A quarter million being raised at the                       Hex-Dump Conversion
fundraiser, and I believe it's predominantly soft.

             Q     How many people --

             MR. MCCURRY: I don't know. We can try and get a
count for you. There was a receiving line of 70 people that he
was seeing. But I'll get the size.

             Q     Can we make sure that we're able to get a pool
report from our pool before we get back to Andrews? The schedule
doesn't make it clear that --

              MR. MCCURRY: There should have been a pool report
already that reported on Secretary Herman's briefing on the
plane.

             Q     From the fundraiser.

             MR. MCCURRY: Oh, from the fundraiser. Oh, okay.
We're feeding the remarks as soon as they come. We're feeding
the remarks the President makes here, but we'll remind the pool
that you have a quick depart out of here.

             Q     -- per person amount?

             MR. MCCURRY: I don't have the per person amount.
See if anyone from the DNC can give us more data -- ticket price,
number, and the total I had which was $250,000.

             Q     This is primarily for the '98 congressional
race or to payoff old DNC debt?

              MR. MCCURRY: Well, the DNC has indicated that in
their fundraising program they will devote most of their proceeds
to the 1998 campaign, and that is indeed what the President wants
to see happen. The President had a good conversation with
Congressman Gephardt on the way over here about some things
they're going to do together with respect to House races in 1998.
But this is a DNC event. We've also done, as you know, events
for the House Campaign Committee as well.

              Q    These fundraisers they'll do together -- what
will they do together for the House races?
that they will try to do together over the course of the coming   Hex-Dump Conversion
months and also some things they'll do with respect to candidate
recruitment, some things the Minority Leader thought the
President might be helpful on. That's one thing they talked
about on the way over. We've been doing a series of things,
working with the House caucus to find ways that we can find some
common thematics and common approaches to the challenge we face
in 1998.

  .          Q        Mike, is Gephardt speaking at the fundraiser or
just the President?

           MR. MCCURRY: I believe -- yes, I believe he is.
The Governor and the Congressman are both speaking.

             Q        Mike, how much is tonight? How much is he

raising at tonight's function?

             MR. MCCURRY: I don't know. We can give that to you
on the way home. The DNC reports that they've got about 60 to 70
guests here. They were asked to contribute $10,000 per couple
and the DNC expects to raise $250,000.

             Q        The DNC expects what?

             Q        Have they put all that behind them, or what?

             MR. MCCURRY: No, I think they -- they acknowledged
they have some differences on some issues, but they also
understand that they've got a big agenda that together they can
pursue in which agreements are far more numerous than
disagreements.

             Q    Mike, after the President was briefed by Alexis
Herman on the flight, number one, what was his reaction to what
she had to say? And number two, did he give her any guidance as
to how to proceed?

               MR. MCCURRY: The President thought Secretary Herman
is exactly right, that they need to continue to press these
parties to resolve their differences at the table. They talked a
little bit about some of the things the Secretary had suggested
to the parties yesterday, that she expects to hear back from the
parties about later today.                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

              The President thought that was the right mix of
efforts to bring them together and try to close some differences
that do exist. And the President instructed her to continue her
efforts to encourage the parties to resolve their differences at
the negotiating table.

              Q    -- the President was saying it was not his job
to tell Americans around the country what party to vote for in
their local congressional races. Next year is he going to be
more forthright in calling for a Democratic Congress?

               MR. MCCURRY: I think he's going to do exactly as he
 did in the '95-'96 cycle which is to work for candidates who
 embrace the kind of agenda that the President puts forward. And
 we find that, thankfully, a vast number of Democrats and
 Democratic candidates really believe that the President's agenda
.is a good one. It's one that they, in most cases, in their
 districts run on as well. And, so we will continue to make the
 case on behalf of candidates who can help continue the progress
 we've seen.

             Q     Mike, UPS announced this morning that every
week the strike goes on that thousands of jobs will be
permanently lost because oflost business. Have they made that
point in discussions with the administration?

              MR. MCCURRY: Both sides make points that try to
underscore their perspective. We hear from the union, similarly,
that their workers are feeling the cost of the strike as well and
the reasons why they are out or for all the reasons that they've
articulated at the table. In any negotiation, in any
labor-management dispute both sides go out and state their claim
to the best case they can make in public. And part of the effort
that the administration is making is to see if we can't get them
to minimize their differences publicly when they're speaking on
behalf of those that they serve and try to privately resolve the
differences that exist so that the company can go back into its
line of business and the workers can go back to work.

             Q      Mike, if I can just follow up on that. Speaker
Gingrich sent a letter to the President asking him to urge the
Teamsters to put the last proposal out for a vote. Has the
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

President had a reaction to that?

             MR. MCCURRY: Well, that is essentially the
company's position. In any labor dispute like this it's not wise
for the administration to side with one party or another as we
try to encourage them to adjudicate their differences. That
would simply be intervening on behalf of the company and the
administration has not chosen that path.

             Q     Mike, on this 15,000 job issue, though, number
one, do you take that as a threat from the company to say at
least 15,000 jobs are gone?

              MR. MCCURRY: It's just not useful for the
administration to characterize what the parties are saying
publicly. They've been saying plenty; we've been trying to get
them to minimize their rhetoric and maximize their negotiating.
And that's the -- it would be more useful for them to talk about
these issues face to face at the negotiating table. And that's,
of course, what we're trying to get them to do.

              Q    The second part of that -- if, indeed, they're
serious that 15,000 jobs will disappear, does that put more
pressure on the administration to take some decisive action?

              MR. MCCURRY: The pressure on the administration is
to continue to try to get both of these parties to resolve a
labor-management dispute that's having some measurable impact on
the lives of the American people. That's why the President has
been involved and getting briefed by the Secretary of Labor.
That's why the Secretary of Labor has been encouraging the
parties to consider ideas that she has put before them.

               But at the end of the day, what they ne~d to do is
settle their differences and go back to work. That's in the
interests both of the company and of the workers.

             Q     There were some picketers at the airport this
morning that were forced to go away before the President came so
he wouldn't see them. Yet there were also picketers at the UPS
facility where we exited the highway. Did the President see the
second group?

           MR. MCCURRY: We see picketers everywhere we go and
we know there are a lot of members of the Teamsters Union that
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
are out on the line now and that it would be hard for the
President or anyone to miss. We wouldn't want to see anyone
inconvenienced by the President's travels, but I'm not familiar
with the individual situation you just mentioned.

             Q If I could just go back to the welfare reform
issue for a moment. In the speech this morning the President was
dismissive of those who had said a year ago that the welfare
reform program wouldn't work. Was he referring to Minority
Leader Gephardt when he said that? Isn't it an awkward situation·
for him to be dismissing those critics on the platform?

              MR. MCCURRY: No. He acknowledges that there were
people within our party that had principled reasons to be against
that bill and had a great deal of skepticism. But the President
made his decision for the reasons he made it, and he's got his
shoulder to the wheel now trying to make the law work. And he's
very encouraged by those who even though they may have taken a
different point of view are now part of the effort to build
bipartisan support for a successful implementation of what is now
the law. And clearly, Congressman Gephardt spoke today in that
vein, and the President appreciated it very much.

              All right. Thank you.

              The Democratic Business Council event tonight that's

being held on behalf of the Democratic National Committee,
they're expecting -- tonight is DNC. Today is DBC. Okay.

             Tonight's Democratic National Committee fundraising
event will have approximately 175 people expected to raise close
to $300,000. They were asking $1,000 per person.


              Q    Mike -- I think it was $1,000 per person --

           MR. MCCURRY: And some, obviously, are going to give
more. The soft money contributors will give more, obviously.

              That's all I got. Thanks. See you back in
Washington.

       TO TRAINEES AND LEADERS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY

                            MID.TEC

11 :25 A.M. CDT


              THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Ladies and
gentlemen, I'm glad to see you all here. I'm sorry it's so hot.
I want to say to my longtime friend and former colleague as a
governor, Senator Kitt Bond, that I was very glad to cross party
lines and follow your lead to take my coat off. (Laughter and
applause.) And now you owe me one and I will call you next time
there's a vote that's real important to me in Congress.
(Laughter.)

              Actually, you don't have to be suffering like this.
The truth is this building is very well air-conditioned, but
Barry Corona is such an entrepreneur, he thought there might be a
market in St. Louis for a large sauna, and that's what we're
testing out today. (Laughter.)

            I'm delighted to be here. I want to, first of all,
say my thanks to my good friend, Governor Carnahan; to my friend,
our Minority Leader, Dick Gephardt; to Kitt Bond and to Mayor
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
officials who are here -- the Speaker of the House Steve Gaugh
(phonetic) is here; Senator Elman (phonetic), the Senate Minority
Leader, is here. Congressman Clay could not be here today, but
we're glad Senator Clay is here with his most important
possession. Thank you for coming. (Applause.) I thank State
Treasurer Holden and Secretary of State Cooke for being here.

             I want to say a special word of thanks -- and I'll
say more about them later -- to the CEO of Monsanto, Bob Shapiro,
and to my good friend Eli Segal, the president of the Welfare to
Work Partnership, and to all the others who are here. And thanks
again to Mid.TEC for hosting us.

             It's great to be back in St. Louis, even on a hot
August day. This city is very much alive. You can see it in the
revived area and your record job growth, your commitment to
education reform, and now to welfare reform. And I want to talk
about finishing the job of welfare reform, moving people from
welfare to work.

             If we expect to be the country we want to be in the
next century, we have to provide opportunity for everyone who's
willing to work for it, we have to require responsibility from
everyone who's capable of providing it, and we have to find a way
to come together across all the lines that divide us to make one
America.

            Fixing our broken welfare system is an important

part of that because it means more opportunity, more
responsibility and a stronger, more united community. It's been
a priority of my presidency. You've heard others mention -- I
think the Governor talked about it -- that shortly after I took
office we began giving people waivers from federal rules that
undermined their reform experiments so they could try new and

innovative ways that would work perhaps in one community but not
another, perhaps in one state but not another, to facilitate the
movement of people from welfare to work.

              Then a year ago next week, I signed the welfare
reform legislation which really did end welfare as we know it.
It was designed to make welfare a second chance, not a way of
life. It gave the states far more responsibilities and
opportunities to create new programs to move people from welfare         Hex-Dump Conversion
to work. It guaranteed children their nutritional and health
care benefits and provided several billion dollars more money to
pay for child care for parents who otherwise could not afford to
take jobs at entry levels if those were the only jobs they could
get.

                Now, a lot of people said that welfare reform would
never work because the private economy wouldn't do its part or
the government wouldn't do its part or we couldn't figure out how
to get people from welfare to work or -- you know, I heard all
the reasons that people said it wouldn't work. But a year later,
I think it's fair to say the debate is over. We know now that
welfare reform works.

              Today I am proud to announce that just since I
signed the law a year ago, there are now 1.4 million fewer people
on welfare in the last year alone. (Applause.) In the four
years and seven months or so, almost eight now, since I took
office, the welfare rolls have declined by 3.4 million, 24
percent, the biggest decline in history. We now have the
smallest percentage of Americans living on public assistance we
have had since 1970. We can make this work if we all work
together. (Applause.)

               I come here to St. Louis and to this fine place and
to these programs -- and let me again thank all of you who are
part of all these programs -- to say that the job is not over.
And the law requires us to do more, because the law says that
able-bodied people, people who are able physically and mentally
to do work, should be on welfare continuously no more than two
years, and no more than five years in a lifetime. Now, if you
say that to someone and you don't want to be cruel to them or
their children, then you must acknowledge that we, the rest of
us, have a moral obligation to make sure there is a job there,
and that if they need training that they have the training they
need for the job. (Applause.)

             The national government is determined to do its
part. Last week when I signed the first balanced budget law ih a
generation into law, we -- (applause) -- thank you. We had two
provisions that I want to especially emphasize: one, $3 billion
in a welfare-to-work challenge fund to help communities with
higher unemployment rates move long-term welfare recipients into
the work force; and two, an expanded and carefully targeted work
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

opportunity tax credit which gives a significant incentive to
private employers, including small business people who need to be
brought into this equation, to move people from welfare to work.

             And in that connection, let me say that we are
committed to doing everything we can. As evidence of that, I
would like to acknowledge the presence here today of the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala; the
Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman; the Administrator of the Small
Business Administration, Aida Alvarez. They're here working with
St. Louis, working with Missouri. We're going to do this with
every major community in every state in our community. We want
to do our part to help you meet the goals of the welfare reform
law. And I thank you all for being here. (Applause.)

               I have also asked the Vice President to head two
other initiatives for me -- one, to bring civic and business
groups together to mentor new employees. I had a friend from the
Midwest call me the other day, and he said, you know, I just want

you to know I really am trying to do what you asked me to do -- I
run a small business -- and we've been friends for many years.
And he said, I'm trying to hire people from welfare to work, but
because the economy is going so well, most of the people who can
easily move into the work force already have, and the people I'm
trying to hire, they're really having a hard time because they've
actually never had to do this before. They've never even had to
show up before at the same time. They don't understand how to
find -- how to handle conflict in the work force. If they run up
against something they can't do, they're uncomfortable asking how
to do it.

              We forget that if we're going to go all the way we
have a lot of work to do to make some of these folks believe in
their own capacities and understand them and understand that,
hey, we all mess up at work. You know that, read my polls,
right? (Laughter.) I mean, sometimes we all mess up at work.
And we've got a lot of work to do to get people in the right
frame of mind to understand that having a job and keeping a job
is a continuous learning and growth experience. So we know we
need to do that. We're trying to do our part with that.

              And, finally, the Vice President is leading our
effort to have the federal government, even in a time when we've
downsized the overall government, fill as many new openings as
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


possible with welfare recipients until we hire 10,000 welfare
recipients on our part over the next couple of years.

              Now, we know that the states, the communities, the
private sector also have to do an awful lot. Believe it or not,
48 of the 50 states have seen their caseloads decline
dramatically. Missouri has done better than the national
average, at 27 percent decline in the last four years.
Thirty-five states have now followed Missouri's lead. Missouri
asked for one of these welfare waivers, so that in certain parts
ofthe state you could authorize employers to receive the welfare
check as a hiring and training supplement for a period of time --
which I thought was a great idea, a legitimate idea, particularly
with people who are harder to place -- to give employers a
premium to really work with those employees and train them and
help them become full-time volunteers.

                Since I came here, first in 1994 to Missouri to
 announce welfare reform efforts, then in 1996 to talk about
 getting the private sector involved, you might be interested to
·know that now 35 other states have allowed Missouri to show them
 that this is a good reform, and they are also doing it. I help
 all the rest of them will, too. (Applause.)

               The most important thing we can do is get the
private sector to hire people. That's why Barry and Chairman
Shapiro are so important to us, because we've got to have the
private sector hiring people. That's why the AmeriCorps project
that I just visited downstairs, training young people for private
sector jobs, is so important.

              And last year when I came to Missouri, we announced
that there would be a national effort involving in the beginning
a number of Missouri corporations, and five corporations
nationally to organize businesses of all sizes to commit to hire
people from welfare to work. Since Monsanto and Sprint and
Burger King and UPS and United Airlines agreed to start that
effort, the Welfare to Work Partnership, which was founded by my
good friend Eli Segal -- who also, by the way, was the first head
of our national service program, AmeriCorps, which has done a
fabulous job, I believe, for young people in our country --
(applause) -- but since we started, we now have over 800
companies of all sized signed up to promise to hire people from
welfare to work. What you should be proud of is that 300 of them
have locations here in St. Louis. And you should be very proud
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
ofthat. (Applause.)


               Now, I want to challenge every employer in America
to join this crusade. And we have a toll-free number, it's
I-888-USA-JOBI -- 1-888-USA-JOBl. I want the employers in this
country who get this number to call it and help a welfare
recipient find a job. And, again, I'd like to thank Sprint for
donating this number. This is quite a considerable financial
investment to help people move from welfare to work, and I
appreciate they're doing it. Remember that. I feel like I'm
hawking something on one of those channels on television --
(laughter) -- 1-888-USA-JOB I -- I can do this.

              Let me close by putting a personal face on this.
There's a woman on stage with us today who is an example of what
someone who once was on welfare with serious obstacles to
overcome can do to become a valuable and successful employee.
Felicia Booker's success took courage, responsibility and a dream
that she could make a better life for her young children, ages
two and six. It also took an employer, A.G. Edwards, willing to
take a chance on her, and people along the way who wanted to help
her realize that dream. Felicia Booker has been working at A.G.
Edwards for nearly a year and a half now. She's a computer
programmer and she's already been promoted once. I'd like for
her to stand and be recognized. Felicia? (Applause.)

              Again, let me say, if this is really going to be a
country where everyone has an opportunity, then we have to prove
that the young women I just met in that job-training program
downstairs are going to be given the opportunity to make the most
of their own lives. Ultimately, that's what welfare reform is
about. It's not primarily about saving the government money --
we're going to balance the budget regardless. It's about
empowering every single person in this country to be a part of
this country in a new century, in a new era.

            Thank you. And God bless you all. (Applause.)
