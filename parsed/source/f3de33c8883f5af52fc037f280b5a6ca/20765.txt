                    COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE, THE JUDICIARY,
                    AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999

                  (Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana; Rogers (R), Kentucky)



       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on the
Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999,
as reported by the House Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.

         The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for many of the President's
priorities within the 302(b) allocation. For example, we appreciate the Committee's funding of
law enforcement programs in general and the COPS program in particular. Funding COPS at
the requested level of $1.4 billion is consistent with the Balanced Budget Agreement and would
enable us to achieve the goal of hiring 100,000 additional police officers by the year 2000.

         However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary investments in other
critical programs funded by this bill. The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level
is to offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas. The President's FY 1999
Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan
Budget Agreement by making savings in mandatory and other programs available to help finance
this spending. In the Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis -- took
similar action in approving funding for surface transportation programs paid for with mandatory
offsets. We want to work with the Congress on mutually agreeable mandatory and other offsets
that would be used to increase high-priority discretionary programs, including those funded by
this bill. In addition, we hope that the Committee will reduce funding for lower priority and
unrequested discretionary programs, and redirect funding to programs of higher priority.

       The Administration has very serious concerns, discussed below, with the Committee's
inadequate funding of a number of priority programs, as well as with objectionable language
provisions. If the bill were presented to the President in its current form, the President's senior
advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.

Legal Services Corporation

        The Committee bill funds the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) at $141 million, $142
million below the FY 1998 enacted level and $199 million below the President's request of $340
million. This funding level is unacceptable. It represents a 65-percent cut from the FY 1995
level of $400 million, would severely cripple the program, and calls into question the Federal
Government's commitment to ensuring that all Americans, regardless of income, have access to
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


the Judicial system. The Supreme Court recently ruled that interest on lawyer trust accounts
(JOLTAs) are the private property of clients and cannot be used to gencmte resources for civil
legal services. This eliminates a funding source that provided LSC programs with more than
$57 million last year and underscores the importance of action to fully fund the President's
request. [The Administration strongly supports an amendment expected to be offered to
increase funding for"the LSC.j-- in brackets pending review of offsets.

Small Business Administration

         The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's funding levels for the
administration of the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) programs. The Committee's
funding level for the Salaries and Expenses account regular operating expenses represents a 27-
percent reduction from the President's request, and includes a requirement that all of the
reduction be taken from headquarters functions. Such funding levels would require reductions
in staff by more than 1,200 staff years through severe reductions-in-force. Not even the
elimination of all headquarters employees would satisfy the Committee report requirement to
take reductions solely from non-District Offices

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

       The Administration strongly urges the House to fully fund the President's request of$279
million for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), $18.5 million above the
Committee mark. The additional resources are essential and would allow EEOC to reduce the
backlog of pending complaints and implement much-needed reforms in the way all complaints
are managed, including an enhanced alternative dispute resolution program. We look forward to
working with Congress to provide funding for EEOC and other programs included in the
President's civil rights enforcement initiative.

Department of Commerce

      Decennial Census. The language in the Committee bill is unacceptable. It is critical
       that the Congress provide full-year funding for the Decennial Census without any
       restrictions on the use of statistical sampling. Delays or disruptions would unacceptably
       complicate the management of this massive operation. We urge the Rules Committee to
       permit an amendment that removes these onerous language restrictions and provide
       funding that allows the Census Bureau to implement its current plan. This plan was
       developed by statistical experts and based on recommendations from the National
       Academy of Sciences, which found that regardless of cost, the methods of the past could
       not achieve satisfactory accuracy. The statistical methods incorporated in the Bureau's
       plan would produce the most accurate census possible and virtually eliminate the large
       undercounts of minorities, children and other groups that occurred in the 1990 census.

      National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Administration objects to


                                                2
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


    inadequate funding for Administration priorities within the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), including: the Clean Water Initiative to protect
    coastal communities; the GLOBE program, which promotes scientific discovery and
    student achievement; and, activities to implement the Endangered Species Act and
    Magnuson-Stevens Act. Reductions to the Climate and Global Change Program would
    slow research to understand the implications of extreme weather events such as EI Nino_
    In addition, by not fully funding the request for the National Weather Service, the
    Committee threatens vital services_ Also, the Administration strongly objects to the
    extension of exclusive fishery management authority in Alabama, Louisiana, and
    Mississippi, which would undermine the current management regime to protect fisheries
    resources. Finally, the Administration is concerned with funding restrictions in bill
    language that could limit NOAA's ability to fulfill its mission.

    The Administration is also particularly concerned about inadequate funding to fulfill
    contract obligations for follow-on polar and geostationary weather satellite programs.
    Renegotiation or termination of these contracts would jeopardize satellite continuity for
    both civilian and military operations and increase costs. The recent failure of the
    GOES-9 satellite underscores the need to maintain production schedules.

   National Institute for Standards and Technology. The Administration is concerned that
    the Committee's exclusion of the requested advance appropriation for the Advanced
    Measurement Laboratory would increase costs and delay completion by at least a year.
    We are also very disappointed by the lack of support for the Advanced Technology
    Program, which fosters cutting-edge research. The Committee allowance would support
    only $43 million in new awards, 54 percent below the President's request of $94 million
    for new awards.

   Statistics Initiatives. The Administration is concerned about inadequate funding for
    high- priority statistical initiatives, especially the improvement of National Account
    measures, the Poverty Measure initiative, and the Continuous Measurement program,
    which will provide annual demographic information on the population and eliminate the
    need for the "long form" in the 20 I 0 Census.

   Minority Business Development Agency. Management reforms at the Minority Business
    Development Agency (MBDA) have improved delivery of programs and technical
    assistance, and MBDA has emerged as a stronger, more focused agency. The
    Administration objects to the reduction to MBDA's base and requests restoration of $2.8
    million.

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

      National Infonnation Infrastructure Program and Other Issues. In the Committee bill, the
       National Infonnation Infrastructure program is reduced by $4 million (20 percent) below
       the FY 1998 enacted level. Such a reduction would substantially decrease seed money
       for innovative infonnation technology projects. In addition, the Administration strongly
       objects to onerous reporting requirements that would require the Department to notify
       Congress before exporting satellites to China.

Year 2000 Computer Conversion

       In the FY 1999 Budget, the President has requested more than $1 billion for Y2K
computer conversion. tn addition, the budget anticipated that additional requirements would
emerge over the course of the year and included an allowance for emergencies and other
unanticipated needs. It is essential to make Y2K funding available quickly and flexibly. The
House effort to defer action on the emergency fund in the Treasury and General Government
Appropriations bill is very troubling, particularly in light of several Subcommittees, including the
Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee, deciding to not fund the base Y2K request.

Department of Justice

       The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for law enforcement
and other Department of Justice activities. However, as discussed below, we are concerned
about Committee action in a number of areas.

      Title V -- At-Risk Children's Grant Program. The Administration urges the House to
       provide $95 million requested for the At-Risk children's proposal. The At-Risk proposal
       supports local community prevention programs such as mentoring, truancy prevention,
       and gang intervention to prevent young people from becoming involved in the criminal
       justice system.

      Drug Testing and Intervention. We are disappointed by the Committee's failure to
       provide any of the $85 million requested for the drug testing and intervention program.
       Systematic drug testing is a proven, cost-effective means of using the coercive power of
       the criminal justice system to move non-violent offenders into drug treatment programs.

      Imposition of State Ethics Rules. The Administration strongly opposes the provisions in
       the bill that would impose State ethics rules on Federal attorneys and establish an
       independent board that could fire Federal agents, prosecutors, and civil law enforcement
       attorneys. These provisions would undennine Federal law enforcement by subjecting
       Department of Justice attorneys to multiple and inconsistent State rules of conduct,
       transferring to the States the authority to regulate the conduct of Federal attorneys in the
       perfonnance of their Federal law enforcement duties.

      Protection Against Terrorism, Including Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons. We
       appreciate the Committee's support of the Administration's effort to combat terrorism,
       particularly the use of chemical and biological weapons. However, we ask that the
       Committee fully fund the request for the Attorney General's Counterterrorism Fund,

                                                 4
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
    including funding for local bomb squad equipment.

   Protection Against Cybercrime and Attacks on Our Nation's Critical Infrastructures. The
    Committee mark excludes Counterterrorism Fund support to combat cybercrime,
    including funding for potential transfer to other agencies and for the FBI's National
    Infrastructure Protection Center. The Department of Commerce has identified funding
    requirements for the interagency Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office, which
    coordinates the development and integration of a national critical infrastructure plan.
    Failure to provide funding would endanger the Government's efforts to fight cybercrime.

   Indian Country. We appreciate the Committee mark for Indian Country. However, we
    urge the House to fully fund the Administration's request for Indian Country criminal
    justice assistance, including FBI and u.s. Attorneys resources.

   Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Administration is disappointed that the
    Committee's level for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is $52 million below the
    President's request. We are particularly concerned about the proposed $30 million
    funding level for the FBI's Information Sharing Initiative (lSI), which is $20 million
    below the request, and would prevent the FBI from improving its electronic case file
    information and thereby increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the FBI's
    investigations. Furthermore, the reporting requirement on lSI would impede the FBI's
    ongoing efforts to provide critical information technology infrastructure support using
    existing resources.

   Immigration and Naturalization Service. We appreciate the Committee's support for the
    Administration's border control initiative. However, the Committee's $2.567 billion
    mark, $156 million below the President's request, is insufficient to support a
    comprehensive, bipartisan border management and enforcement strategy. The
    President's request supports increased border management funding for Border Patrol
    agents, critical infrastructure and technology, detention support, interior enforcement, and
    includes $36 million more than the Committee's level for Border Patrol, detention, and
    office construction. We urge the House to fully fund the President's request.

   Bureau of Prisons/Abortion. The Administration urges the House to strike section 103
    of the Committee bill, which would prohibit the Bureau of Prisons from funding
    abortions except in cases of rape or where the life of the mother is endangered. The
    Department of Justice believes that there is a great likelihood that this provision would be
    held unconstitutional.




                                             5
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


      Juvenile Justice Block Grant. The Administration is concerned that the $250 million
       Juvenile Justice Block Grant in the Committee bill may authorize a broad and unfocused
       range of spending, and urges the House to provide funding for more targeted activities,
       including direct funds for local prosecutors to target juvenile and quality of life crimes.

      Narrowband Communications. The Administration is disappointed that the Cornmittee
       has not provided the $86 million requested to establish a fund for the consolidation and
       coordination of the Department's conversion to narrowband communications systems.
       We urge the House to establish such a fund and to restore the $24 million in base
       resources that are excluded from the Committee mark.

Potential Amendment Related to Presidential Executive Order

       The Administration would strongly oppose an amendment that may be offered that would
prohibit the use of funds in the Act for implementing the May 28, 1998, Presidential Executive
Order which provides a uniform policy for the Federal Government to prohibit employment
discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Federal civilian workforce.

International Affairs Programs

         The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Department of State's
Diplomatic and Consular Programs and Salaries and Expenses accounts. However, we are
concerned about the Committee's reduction of$26 million for the Department's operating
requirements. Further, the Committee's reduction of $38 million to the request for information
technology improvements in the Capital Investment Fund would jeopardize the Department's
effort to achieve Y2K compliance. In addition, limits placed on the amount offees to execute
the President's Border Security Program that can be used in FY 1999 could slow urgently needed
border security improvements.

        The Administration is very concerned about the Committee's $245 million reduction to
the request for Security and Maintenance of U.S. Missions. The Committee's mark does not
fund construction of needed Embassy projects in Beijing and Berlin and would require offsets
against regular security and maintenance activities to fund initial design work for these important
projects. We request that the Committee provide a funding level consistent with the President's
budget for urgently needed embassy facilities and ongoing security and maintenance programs,
including Y2K-related activities.

         The Administration appreciates the steps the Committee has taken to fund the request for
arrearage payments this year. The Administration wants to work with the Congress to ensure
that these funds are available in a timely fashion to retain our influence in these organizations
and to identify reform measures that further U.S. interests. However, we strongly oppose the
bill's authorization requirement that is intended to subject this important foreign policy measure
to the unrelated issue of family planning policy. There is legitimate disagreement over this


                                                 6
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

 issue, but none of the U.N. and related international organizations arrears payments is related to
 this issue. Therefore, it is wholly inappropriate to hold the payment of U.S. arrears hostage to
.the family planning issue.

        Further, although the Committee has provided significant funding for the Contributions to
International Organizations (CIO) and Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities for
FY 1999, the Administration is concerned that reductions in these accounts would increase
arrears and impair the ability of the United States to address foreign policy interests through the
mechanism of U.N. peacekeeping.

       The Administration opposes the Committee's proposal to provide up to $15 million for
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty needs by transfer from the CIO account without any
increase in funding. We strongly believe that these important activities should be funded at the
$29 million level, as requested in the Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related
Programs account.

        The Administration is concerned about the $21 million overall reduction to the request
for the U.S. Information Agency (USIA). Given that the USIA request is virtually at the FY
1998 level, the Committee's reduction would hurt core public diplomacy activities, Year 2000
compliance, critical broadcasting activities including broadcasting to Africa, and important grant
programs. We urge the House to provide funding for USIA's operating and special accounts at
the requested level.

        Finally, the Administration is concerned about the Committee's reductions for the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, the Asia Foundation, the American Institute in Taiwan, and
the International Commissions. Such reductions would place a disproportionate b.urden on the
operating budgets of these small agencies.

Federal Communications Commission

        The Administration is very concerned about the lack of funding for any of the requested
increases for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Committee's funding level
could require an agency-wide furlough or reduction-in-force, impairing the FCC's ability to
implement the mandates of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and to carry out critical mission
operations.

Teamsters Election

       The Administration objects to the continuation oflast year's rider that prohibits the use of
funds for supervising the Teamster's election, despite a court order requiring the Federal
Government to pay for a supervised election.
