                        National Governors' Association Speech
                                    July 28, 1997
                        Questions and Answers --7/25 DRAFT


Welfare to Work

Question:      The President said that Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are among states
            that are giving tax incentives to employers. What exactly are they doing?

Answer:     According to a report from the National Governor's Association, under
            Massachusetts' Full Employment Program, employers receive subsidies of$2.50
            per hour for up to nine months. Participating employers are also entitled to an
            excise tax credit of $1 00 per moth for each FEP employee hired. Pennsylvania
            rewards employers for participating in their Employment Incentive Program (EIP)
            by providing up to $5100 in state tax credits for each welfare recipient an
            employer hires. The employer can earn $1,500 of the possible tax credit by
            paying for or providing child care to the welfare recipients hired. The welfare
            recipient must be employed for at least one year for the employer to receive the
            financial incentives.

Question:   In his speech, the President cited North Carolina as an example of a state
            that is effectively creating public-private partnerships to move welfare
            recipients to work. What is North Carolina doing?

Answer:     As part of North Carolina's Work First Program, the state is recruiting business
            leaders to hire people off welfare. Many county offices have contracts with the
            local Chambers of Commerce to hold job fairs once a month and meetings with
            chief executives.

Question:   The President also commended Las Vegas, Nevada and the hotel/casino
            industry for their partnership in hiring welfare recipients. What exactly are
            they doing?

Answer:     Las Vegas, the state of Nevada, the Chamber ofCornmerce and the hotel/casino
            industry have been working closely to get jobs for welfare recipients. The State
            goal is for new casinos to set aside 10 percent of all jobs for TANF recipients.
            Several hotels have already met this standard, including the new MOM Hotel
            (1,000 positions), the Stratosphere hotel (2,600 positions) and the Silver Legacy
            Hotel (2,800 positions).

Child Care

Question:    The President said that about half the states are increasing their spending
             beyond what is needed to match new federal child care funds. Which states
             was he talking about?

Answer:      The President commended states that are making child care a priority because
child
             care is the most critical support for families moving from welfare to work and
             low-income working families struggling to make ends meet. According to an
             APWA, the 24 states that are already making this financial commitment to child
             care are: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,
             Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana,
             Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont,
             Washington State and Wyoming.

Question:    The President mentioned Florida and Wisconsin specifically - - what are
             they doing?

Answer:      Wisconsin and Florida are examples of states that are making important
             investments in child care with state funds and/or by transferring TANF funds.

Question:    What are examples of states that have seamless child care systems?

Answer:      Illinois, Michigan, Washington

Question:    What is the White House Conference on Child Care that the President
             mentioned in his remarks?

Answer:      Last week the President announced that he and the First Lady will host the first-
             ver White House Conference on Child Care on October 23, 1997. The
             conference will examine the strengths and weaknesses of child care in America
             and explore how our nation can better respond to the needs of working families
             for affordable, high quality child care. The conference builds on the Clinton
             Administration's long-standing commitment to increasing access to child care and
             ensuring child care quality.

Transportation

Question:   The President mentioned three states that have started to address the
            transportation challenges of welfare reform. Can you tell me more about
            what they're doing?

Answer:     Kentucky: As part of Kentucky's "Empower Kentucky" initiative, Gov. Paul
            Patton's is developing a new transportation system that will ensure that welfare
            recipients all over the state can receive safe, timely and effective transportation to
            work, job training program, and child care and health facilities. This
            transportation system will integrate the transportation programs of four cabinets --
            Children and Families, Health Services, Transportation, and Families and
            Workforce Deve1opment-- and extend service to areas of the state currently
            underserved. The new system will include creating 8-14 transportation regions
            across the state, contracting with a single broker/provider in each region, and
            establishing a toll-free number for recipients to arrange for transportation through
            their regional broker.

            Michigan: Michigan's "Project Zero" is a pilot state effort in five counties to
            reduce to zero the number of public assistance households without eamed income.
             As part of the pilot, three state agencies are partnering to address the
            transportation barriers faced by participants. Michigan's Suburban Mobility
            Authority for Regional Transportation provides bus patrons with a ride from their
            stop to their work site. New employees are provided one month of free bus
            service. In addition, the Urban and Public Transportation Program provides
            vehicles to counties to assists clients in getting to work and child care sites during
            off-peak working hours.

            Wisconsin: Wisconsin developed "Job Ride" in 1989 to respond to the emerging
            transportation need for welfare recipients. For example, statewide only 3.5
            percent of families receiving public assistance own automobiles. The program
            sought created an innovative van pool to link low-income job seekers with jobs in
            outlying suburban areas. The program served more than 1,100 job placements in
            Milwaukee and Southeast Wisconsin and recorded over 72,000 trips to work in its
            eight-year history.

Question:   The President noted that some states are using welfare block grant dollars to
            fund transportation. Can you give me an example?

Answer:     In Connecticut., Governor Rowland has committed to using $2.2 million of the
            state's T ANF dollars for transportation services for public transit operators across
            the State to provide new transportation services to move welfare recipients to
            work.

Question:    The President said he recently proposed legislation providing $600 million to
             help states and local communities move people from welfare to work. Could
             you tell us more about this?

Answer:      The President is proposing to use the $600 million in new funds to create an
             Access to Jobs program as part of the reauthorization of the ISTEA transportation
             bill. This six-year competitive grant program will support new, flexible,
             innovative transportation services to get people to where the jobs are.

Investing in Welfare

 Question:   The President challenged all states to follow the lead of Maryland.
             What is Maryland doing?

Answer:                Maryland has committed to maintain their investment in welfare reform
efforts --
             above and beyond what the new welfare law requires. Some of the resources are
             going to demonstration projects in critical areas like reducing teen pregnancy; but
             most of the money is going back to local communities for them to reinvest in job
             training and support services to families like case management, child care and
             transportation.

             [Background: The welfare law requires states to maintain 80% (75% for states
             that meet work participation requirements) of their FY 94 state spending on cash
             assistance programs. This is called the Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirement.
              Maryland has committed to spending 100% of its MOE.]

Question:              The President said that some states have been debating how to divert
savings
             generated from welfare caseload declines away from welfare reform efforts.
             Which states have been considering this? As a former Governor, doesn't the
             President understand that states often have competing needs for dollars and
             have to spend any savings where they are most needed?

Answer:                Diverting welfare savings for other uses has been discussed in many states.
 We
             happen to have detailed information from the Center for Public Policy Priorities
             (CPPP) in Austin, Texas, an organization that monitors budgeting decisions in the
             State legislature. CPPP found that Texas will have a $363 million T ANF
             "surplus" due to declining caseloads. Of this surplus, Texas used only about
             one-third on services for welfare recipients; the state used most of the rest of the
             federal funds to replace existing state spending, fill budget gaps, or purchase other

Child Support                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

Question:     The President said that some states are lagging behind in enactiIig the new
              child support laws. Which states have not completed work on legislation?

Answer:       Currently, 26 states have enacted the new child support enforcement measures of
              the new welfare law. The main new enforcement tools are new hire reporting,
              license revocation, centralized state collections, uniform interstate collection laws
              and streamlining paternity establishment. These new measures will substantially
              increase child support collections.

              Unfortunately, 8 states have not included some of the provisions of the new law.
              Those states are Alaska, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, Oklahoma
              and Vermont. Some of the measures not adopted by the states are new hire
              reporting (Illinois), and other significant measures that makes it easier for the
              states to seize funds from paychecks and property owned by deadbeat parents.
              Not including all the provisions undermines the states' ability to ensure that
              children get the support they deserve and need. The President today sent a very
              strong message that states have to act quickly and pass these crucial child support
              enforcement provisions.

Question:     What about the remaining states?

Answer:       The other states and territories have either not yet finished their legislative
seSSIOns
              or, under the law, have some additional time to pass the new enforcement
              provisions. The President sent a strong message today that states need to put
              these new enforcement tools in place or children will not get the full support they
              need.

Question:            What will happen to the states that don't pass the new provisions?

Answer:       We are taking the passage of these provisions very seriously. States that do not
              pass the new enforcement tools will receive a warning from HHS to comply with
              the law. If the states still do not come into compliance, they will risk losing
              federal funds for their child support enforcement. The stakes are high here, but
              getting badly needed support to children is our highest priority.

Question:     Is it true that the states could also lose their federal welfare funding?

Answer:              If a state does not have a fully compliant child support enforcement
program, it
              risks a loss of its federal welfare funds. Child support can be crucial to help

                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

             families achieve self-sufficiency and get off the welfare rolls. Parents, not
             taxpayers, should support their children.
Question:    Didn't GAO recently release a report which criticized the federal
government
             for a lack of strong leadership and direction in helping states with child
             support computer systems? Aren't a lot of states going to miss this
             October's deadline for having their computer systems up and running?

Answer:      As many as 9 states say they are concerned that they will not meet the deadline.
             There are several main reasons why states have had difficulties. States have
             experienced contractor problems. States with county-based child support
             programs, like these states, have encountered jurisdictional problems between the
             counties and the states.

             The child support system is a federal/state partnership. Within this partnership, it
             is the states' responsibility to implement these important computer systems. The
             law clearly places this significant project in their hands. HHS has pushed the
             states to meet deadlines, provided technical assistance and where necessary
             suspended funding to states which were not making progress.

Welfare Caseloads

Question:    The President said in his speech that nine states have cut their rolls by over
             40% in the last 4 years. Which states are these?

Answer:      The nine states that the President was referring to are Indiana, Massachusetts,
             Mississippi, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and
             Wyoming.

Question:    How many people are now on the welfare rolls?

Answer:      Just under 11 million, down from 14.1 million in January 1993, a drop of3.1
             million or 22 percent.

Question:    Why do you say that we now have the lowest percentage of the population on
             welfare since 1970?

Answer:      According to HHS data, 4.1% of the U.S. population was on welfare in April 1997
             -- that's 11 million people out of a total U.S. population of267 million. In 1970,
             the comparable figures were 8.5 million people on welfare out of a total U.S.
             population of205 million.

Question:          Why do you think the caseload numbers are down?

Answer:     In May, the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) issued a report to explain some
            of the reasons for the dramatic decline in the welfare caseload during the last four
            years. According to the CEA's analysis, over 40 percent of the reduction in the
            welfare rolls can be attributed to the strong economic growth during the Clinton
            Administration, nearly one-third can be attributed to waivers granted to states to
            test innovative strategies to move people from welfare to work, and the rest is
            attributed to other factors -- such as the Clinton Administration's priorities to
            increase the Eamed Income Tax Credit, strengthen child support enforcement, and
            increase funding for child care.

Question:   If the welfare rolls were declining before the new welfare law, why did he
            need to sign it?

Answer:     The caseload reductions show why the President signed the welfare law -- they're
            the best evidence that welfare reform works. As you know, this Administration
            granted welfare reform waivers to 43 states so they could impose tough work
            requirements and time limits and provide incentives that made work pay better
            than welfare. The 22 percent decline in welfare caseloads since January 1993
            shows that these kinds of actions work. With the new law, governors can expand
            these welfare reform actions without having to petition Washington.

July 1st

Question:   What is the significance of the July 1 implementation date?

Answer:     In accordance with the welfare law signed by the President last August, as of July
            1 all states are now operating under the tough new work rules of the Temporary
            Assistance of Needy Families (TANF) program. Welfare is now a truly
            transitional assistance program that requires work in exchange for time-limited
            assistance.

            However, even before welfare reform many states were well on there way to
            changing their welfare programs to jobs programs. By waiving certain provisions
            in federal statutes, the Clinton Administration allowed 43 states -- more than all
            previous Administrations combined -- to require work, time-limit assistance,
            make work pay, improve child support enforcement, and encourage parental
            responsibility. Nearly 90 percent of states have chosen to continue or build on
            their welfare demonstration project approved by the Clinton Administration.

White House Hiring

Question:    The White House pledged to hire 6 welfare recipients by the year 2000.
             Have any been hired?

Answer:      Yes. The Executive Office of the President has already hired 6 welfare
             recipients. [Note that the original commitment that the "White House" would hire
             6 people actually reflected the full Executive Office of the President, including
             OMB and the Office of Administration. To date, the White House has hired 3
             people, OMB has hired 2, and the Office of Administration has hired 1.]

Welfare Privatization

Question:    How hard are you fighting Congressional efforts to change th~ law to
             allow privatization of Medicaid and Food Stamp operations?

Answer:      We strongly oppose these proposals, believing that allowing states to privatize
             health and human services programs would not be in the best interests of program
             beneficiaries. As you know, we recently told the state of Texas that while certain
             program functions, such as computer systems, can currently be contracted out to
             private entities, the certification of eligibility for benefits and related operations
             (such as obtaining and verifying information about income and other eligibility
             factors) should remain public functions.

Minimum Wage and Workfare

Question:    Are you going to accept the House welfare provisions which undermine the
             minimum wage and worker protections?

Answer:      We strongly oppose the House provisions on the minimum wage and worker
             protections. We believe that everyone who can work must work, and that those
             who work should earn at least the minimum wage and receive the protections of
             existing employment laws -- regardless of whether they are coming off welfare.

             In addition, the Administration strongly believes that we must retain the welfare
             law's strict emphasis on work and oppose provisions to permit States to count
             additional time spent in activities such as job search toward the work
             requirements.

Question:    What is the Administration doing to ensure that welfare recipients going to
             work don't displace other workers?

Answer:      We are strongly supporting proposed legislation that would strengthen the anti-
             displacement provisions of the welfare law_ We are urging Congress, at a
             minimum, to include in the welfare law the non-displacement language from H.R.
             1385, the House-passed job training reform bill. We were successful in getting
             these protections added to the Ways and Means and Education and Workforce
             Committees on the House side; we must retain these improvements in conference.
              We are also urging the conferees to accept the House provision which ensures the
             Federal Government will not pre-empt State non-displacement laws that provide
             greater worker protections than Federal law.

Welfare to Work in the Budget Bill

Question:    What do the budget bills do to promote work?

Answer:      The budget agreement contains two critical welfare to work initiatives. The
             first is a $3 billion Welfare to Work fund for cities and states to create job
             opportunities for welfare recipients. This proposal, a centerpiece of the
             President's second-term agenda, will help move one million adults from welfare to
             work. The budget agreement also includes our proposed enhanced tax credit that
             would give companies that hire long-term welfare recipients a 50 tax credit on
             the first $10,000 of wages paid over two years. In conference, we are fighting to
             include the House Ways and Means version of the $3 billion welfare to work
             program, which directs more funds towards poor cities, and to revise the
             proposed welfare to work tax credit to conform to the budget agreement.
