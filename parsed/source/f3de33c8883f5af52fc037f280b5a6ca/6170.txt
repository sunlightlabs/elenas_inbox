     SUBJECT                       FOLLOW-UP

            As you know, on December 17, 1997 we arranged a working dinner for labor and
     administration officials. This memorandum outlines the Administration's next steps to
     implement the general principles we discussed during the dinner. To begin, we want to outline
     the general principles:

                  Ronald Reagan did more to discourage organizing among workers than any other
                   President. As a Democratic Administration we are committed to investigating
                   the opportunities we may have to support the right of workers to exercise their
                   free choice to vote for a union;


                  CEA reports that weekly earnings for unionized workers are about one third
                   higher than those of non-unionized workers. After adjusting for econometric
                   studies that try to control for factors other than unionization, unionized workers'


                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
              communications strategy that amplifies this message and promotes the
              Administration's interest in improving wages and benefits for working families.

       To implement these principles we will accomplish the following:

        l. Immediately following the State of the Union, we will convene a meeting with the
following participants: staff from the President's National Economic and the Domestic Policy
Councils, the Labor and Commerce Departments, the AFL-CIO and the affiliates represented at
the dinner. Based on the principles outlined above, we will focus on three tasks:

             Identify specific areas where the White House, Commerce and Labor Departments
              can implement the principles;
             Develop a strategy to communicate these principles and goals to other relevant
              agencies;
             Develop a process whereby the principles and analysis can become an integral
              part of the agencies.

         2. We will convene a meeting of staff who are Administration spokespersons to discuss
messages and scheduling that would assist in implementing the principles. We agree that the
President's use of his "bully pulpit" is essential to changing the prevailing culture around
organizing and workers' right to choose. We further agree that what the President says about
this issue, where he goes and who he talks with are crucial to altering the way organizing is
thought about and discussed.

        3. Our preparation for the AFL-CIO March Annual Meeting will reflect our focus on
workers, their wages, benefits and working conditions. Our visit will be about organizing and
how we facilitate a workers' right to choose so that their wages and benefits will increase. We
will work with the AFL-CIO to convene a forum where White House and Agency staff who
attend the March meeting can discuss with organizing directors successful, unsuccessful and
on-going organizing campaigns.

       4. If the process outlined in Step # 1 above is successful, we will institutionalize the
NEC, DPC, Labor, Commerce, AFL-CIO and affiliate team as a regular vehicle for reporting to
and hearing from the Administration and Labor and to ensure that the principles are implemented
fully.

      We want to thank-you again for taking time from your schedules to attend the dinner last
month. We look forward to working with you to implement this plan.
