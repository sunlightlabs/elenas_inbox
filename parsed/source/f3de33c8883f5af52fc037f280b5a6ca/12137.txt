                            Panel Participants for Equal Pay Event

Professor Nancy Hopkins, molecular biologist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Professor Hopkins was the initiator of the effort at M.I.T. to study gender discrimination in the
School of Science. At the beginning of her career at M.LT, Professor Hopkins felt that she was
treated equally with the male faculty members. However, even after learning somewhat
fortuitously that she was 20 percent underpaid, she did not really believe that she was being
discriminated against, albeit unintentionally. However, in 1994 after seeing how other women
were treated, Professor Hopkins joined forces with the only 14 other tenured women faculty vs.
194 tenured male faculty in the School of Science to see whether their situations were unique.
These woman found that they shared common experiences, and the university agreed to set up a
committee to study how female faculty were treated in the School of Science. The committee
found that senior female faculty members were marginalized; were not given sufficient space or
resources for their research; and were not paid equally. Recently, M.LT. published the report of
the committee and has made concerted efforts to correct these disparities. Professor Hopkins
believes that the success of this initiative stemmed, in large part, from the collaboration between
the school and the professors in trying to identify and solve the problem. Professor Hopkins
continues to try to expand this effort to the entire university.

Sanya Tyler, Head Women's Basketball Coach, Howard University
Ms. Tyler is the head women's basketball coach at Howard University. Ms. Tyler sued Howard
University under Title IX and the Equal Pay Act and won. Ms. Tyler. claimed that her program
received fewer resources such as locker room facilities and equipment and that she made less
money than the men's basketball and football coaches. Ms. Tyler has worked at Howard for 24
years, and has coached there 18 years, winning many championships and being voted coach of
the year several times.

Patricia Higgins, Nurse, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio
Ms. Higgins, 50, has been a nurse for 25 years and has worked at MetroHealth Medical Center, a
public hospital, in Cleveland for 16 years. She is currently involved in an AFSCME union
drive and feels very strongly that nurses are underpaid and undervalued. She has three children
-- a son who is 30 years old, a daughter in college who wants to be a nurse, and a son who is 20
and disabled. It was only when her daughter indicated that she wanted to be a nurse that Ms.
Higgins became more vocal about trying to get more pay for nurses. Ms. Higgins admitted that
if she did not have her husband's salary it would have been very difficult to raise her children and
that she certainly could not have paid for her daughter's college tuition.

Carolyn Gantt, Clerk, Retired Seniors Volunteer Program (a senior program),
Washington, D.C.
Ms. Gantt is 74 years old, African American, and has seven children. She worked for the D.C.
Housing Department between 1976 and 1980, and again between 1985 and 1992. Ms. Gantt,
who has a G.E.D., admitted that when she worked for the D.C. government she was paid low
wages and that men who had less education than she (high school drop outs) received better
positions and more training. Ms. Gantt retired in 1992 and hoped that she would be able to
relax, travel, and take some classes. However, she realized that she could not make ends meet
