TEXT:
Attached is Cynthia's and my best effort to make sense of where we are on
Shaw's new workfare compromise. Since there are major choices to be made
and we are tentatively scheduled to talk with Tanner/Stenholm tomorrow at
11, it would be very helpful if you could either read this tonight or if
we get a chance to talk before the meeting.  (There's always the staff
meeting at 9:15 as a fallback.)

We got the agencies' reactions this morning. The main news items are:
(1) Haskins' draft legislation raises concerns on labor protections, but
they seem to be fixable IF Haskins is sincere in wanting to fix them; (2)
the FICA/FUTA exemption includes "private sector workfare", a concept we
are afraid will blossom if employers can avoid those taxes, to the
detriment of private sector jobs; and (3) the definition of community
service is so broad that employers may have an incentive to call
everything community service to get around FICA.

Elena, DOL says that the draft manages to allow the checks to come from
welfare offices rather than from the employer, without doing violence to
the person's employee status.   (Employers would still be required to keep
records of hours worked.)

We pushed HHS to quantify how much these provisions would weaken the work
requirements, an assignment they were singularly unenthusiastic about.
They claim they will get us something by COB today.  DOL is quietly
checking with the labor unions to see what they think of all this.  Emily
is checking with Democratic Governors to see if any of them are already
committed to Shaw's proposal.

 The following is a HEX DUMP:
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
          Options for Reaction to Shaw Minimum WagelWorkfare Proposal


1.   Oppose proposal without offering an alternative:

           Stress weakening of work requirements, with examples
           Point out that proposal raises serious questions about labor protections
            (without offering potential fixes)
           Continue to state our openness to FICAIFUTA exemption

2.   Oppose proposal; offer an alternative

           4 alternatives (see below)
           Call Democratic Governors asap to try to prevent defections to Shaw

3.   Support or do not object to proposal; offer a number of technical suggestions ASAP
     via Tanner

           Offer DOL fixes to ensure no negative implications for labor protections
           Ensure narrow definition of community service; rule out private sector workfare
           Other technical fixes
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
                             Description of W &M compromise:

1.    Defines maximum hours of work experience/community services, including private
      sector workfare (TANF + food stamps - child support collected).

2.    Ifmaximum hours calculation above falls short oflaw's work requirements, allows states
      to use any other work activity to reach work requirements -- job search, vocational
      education, training directly related to employment, and education for those without a high
      school diploma. The current 6-week limit on job search and 12-month limit on voc ed
      would be lifted for this purpose.

3.    Exempts work experience and community service from FICA and FUTA. (Defines those
      two work activities so broadly that it raises concern that it could encompass unsubsidized
      or subsidized jobs.)

4.    Stated intent is to preserve employee status, but DOL feels legislative language does not
      make this clear. They are drafting potential fixes to this problems in case we want them.
       Allows payment for work experience/community service to be paid by welfare office
      instead of "employer."


                                 Four Possible Alternatives

Alternative 1:
      Agree only to FICAIFUTA exemption and allowing welfare office to make payment
       instead of employer (close to our July offer).

Alternative 2:
      No agreement to maximum hours calculation.

     Give all states more flexibility in work activities over 20 hours per week (30 hours for
      two parent families). Current law already allows greater flexibility over 20 hours (30
      hours) by permitting job skills training directly related to employment and education for
      those without a high school diploma. We would go beyond that by permitting job
      search/job readiness beyond the 6 weeks currently allowed.

     Exempt work experience/community service from FICAIFUTA, but stipulate that this
      does not apply to private sector workfare and that private sector employers must pay
      FICAIFUTA on portion of wages they pay.

     Do not weaken May Department of Labor ruling on employee status/worker protections;
      make it an option for wage to continue to come from welfare office, not employer.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

Alternative 3:
     Similar to Alternative 2, but work off of Ways and Means "maximum hours" structure.
      (This approach was suggested by Stenholm.) No change below 20 hours (or 30 for two
      parent families), but for those states whose benefits can't support the required numper of
      hours above 20 (or 30) hours, permit job search/job placement with no 6 week limit.
      This altemative would not permit vocational education in excess of 12 months above 20
      (or 30) hours per week as would the Ways and Means proposal.

      Exempt work experience/community service from FICAIFUTA, but stipulate that this
       does not apply to private sector workfare and that private sector employers must pay
       FICAIFUTA on portion of wages they pay.

      Do not weaken May Department of Labor ruling on employee status/worker protections;
       make it an option for wage to continue to come from welfare office, not employer.

Alternative 4:
     Ways and Means "maximum hours" structure for hours above and below 20 hours, but
      permit only two additional work activities: (1) job search/job placement in excess of 6
      weeks; and (2) job skills training directly related to employment. This alternative would
      not permit vocational education in excess of 12 months above 20 (or 30) hours per week
      as would the Ways and Means proposal.

      Exempt work experience/community service from FICAIFUTA, but stipulate that this
       does not apply to private sector workfare and that private sector employers must pay
       FICAIFUTA on portion of wages they pay.

      Do not weaken May Department of Labor ruling on employee status/worker protections;
       make it an option for wage to continue to come from welfare office, not employer.

                        Other Possible Things to Demand in Exchange

      Waivers:
              Do not allow prior law waiver exemptions to count as work in the numerator (i.e.,
               drug treatment, education, job search) even if a state continues its waiver.
               (Alternatively: do not count as work unless a state is continuing research group
               policies in order to complete an impact evaluation of a waiver demonstration.)
              The five year time limit starts when state joins TANF, not at the end of the waiver
               period, as even if the state previously had a time limit of a different length under a
               WaIver.
      Bifurcation -- clarify that state programs must meet same work requirements as federal
       dollars (this is a very big item)
      Job search limit of 6 weeks is lifetime, not annual (HHS draft reg calls it annual).
