       PRESIDENT CLINTON RELEASES REPORT DOCUMENTING ACTIONS FEDERAL
    GOVERNMENT IS TAKING TO IMPLEMENT A PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS AND URGES
     VOTERS TO SEND BACK A CONGRESS THAT SHARES HIS COMMITMENT TO PASS
           LEGISLATION TO ASSURE PROTECTIONS FOR ALL HEALTH PLANS
                                November 2, 1998

Today, President Clinton urged voters to send back a Congress that shares his commitment to passing a
strong enforceable patients' bill of rights next year. The President also emphasized that while the
Republican Leadership has stalled on the patients' bill of rights, the Administration has been doing
everything possible to implement these protections in Federal health plans. To that end, he unveiled a report
from the Vice President documenting action that the Federal government is taking within its authority to
implement the patients' bill of rights in the health plans it administers or oversees. Today, the President:

Criticized Republican Leadership for allowing Congress to adjourn without passing a strong
patients' bill of rights. For a full year, the President has been calling on the Congress to pass a strong
enforceable patients' bill of rights. For months, the Republican Leadership used every possible stall tactic to
thwart the patients' bill of rights. When the Republican Leadership finally did introduce a bill, their
proposal contained more loopholes than patient protections. It did not contain critical protections such as
access to specialists and offered false promises such as an appeals process that left the decisions in the hands
of HMO accountants. In fact, Senator Lott would not even allow an up or down vote to be held on this
issue.

Urged voters to choose a Congress committed to passing a meaningful patients' bill of rights.
President Clinton committed to doing everything possible to pass a strong patients' bill of rights in the next
Congress and urged Americans to go to the polls tomorrow to elect a Congress that shares this commitment.
This legislation should include enforceable patient protections, such as access to specialists, coverage of
emergency room services when and where the need arises, continuity of care protections, an internal and
independent external appeals process to appeal decisions made by HMO accountants, and protections to
assure that HMOs are held accountable when patients are harmed or injured due to a health plans' decisions.

Released report from the Vice President that highlighted that while the Republican Leadership
delayed, the Administration is acting to implement patient protections in Federal health plans. In
February, the President directed Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the
Department of Defense Military Health Program, and the Veteran's Health Program -- which serve over 85
million Americans -- to, where possible, come into compliance with the patients' bill of rights outlined by
the President's Quality Commission. Today, the Vice President released a report highlighting that these
agencies have taken al1 the action within their statutory authority to implement patient protections. As a
result, the Federal health plans are now, or soon will be, in virtual compliance with the patients' bill of rights.
 The report documents that:

      The 285 participating health plans, covering nine million Federal employees and their
       dependents, have been directed to implement new patient protections this year. The Office of
       Personell Management (OPM), which oversees the Federal Health Employees Benefits Program
       (FEHBP) serving nine million Federal employees and dependents, has directed their 285 participating
       health plans to come into compliance with the patients' bill of rights. Through their annual call
       letter, OPM has specifically requested that plans implement new protections including access to
       specialists, continuity of care, disclosure of financial incentives, and access to emergency room
       services. Finally, OPM has issue new regulations to prevent "gag clauses." OPM is also sending
       information to beneficiaries to assure they are fully aware of their new patient protections.
    Building on Medicare's commitment to provide essential patient protections, HHS published an
    Interim Final rule, in June, that includes a series of new patient protections for Medicare
    beneficiaries. When this rule is fully implemented, Medicare will be virtually in compliance
    with the patients' bill of rights including new protections such as access to emergency services
    when and where the need arises, patient participation in treatment decisions, and access to specialists ..

   The 38 million Medicaid beneficiaries are being assured essential protections in the patients'
    bill of rights. In September, the Health Care Financing Administration published a Notice of
    Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) adding new patients protections for Medicaid beneficiaries,
    such as access to specialists and an expedited independent appeals process to bring the program
    in compliance with the patients' bill of rights, where possible.

   Over eight million Americans will receive the protections in the patients' bill of rights by the
    end of this year as a result of the new policy directive assured by the Defense Department's
    Military Health System (MHS). In response to the President's directive, DoD issued "The
    Patients' Bill of Rights and Responsibilities in the Military Health System," a major policy directive
    to all participants in the MHS. This directive outlined new protections for the over 8 million
    beneficiaries served by MHS, including access to appropriate specialists for women's health needs
    and chronic illnesses and rights for the full discussion of treatment options and of financial
    incentives. With this directive, which will be fully implemented by the end of this year, DoD will
    now be in compliance with the patients' bill of rights .

   Over three million veterans are or will soon be assured virtually all patient protections. In
    July, the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) issued an Information Memorandum to participating
    health providers announcing its intention to have an external appeals process in place by the end of
    the year. Similarly, DVA established a task force to make recommendations as to how best
    implement information disclosure requirements consistent with Commission's recommendations and
    has developed a new brochure to provide beneficiaries the necessary information. With the
    implementation of these new protections DVA is in virtual compliance with the patients' bill of rights
   The 125 million Americans covered by ERISA stilI are not assured critical patient protections
    because the Department of Labor does not have the authority to implement them without
    legislation. DoL oversees the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), governing
    approximately 2.5 million private sector health plans, that cover about 125 million Americans, issued
    a new regulation to implement an expedited internal appeals process and information disclosure
    requirements. However, DoL's report underscores that unless Congress passes Federal legislation,
    they do not have the authority to implement most patient protections.

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
