                       Recommendations on Crack Cocaine Sentencing
                                               July 22, 1997

     Announcement
         Today, the President stated that he had accepted a recommendation from the Attorney
          General and Drug Director to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine
          sentences from a ratio of 100 to 1, to a ratio of 10 to 1. Specifically, the
          recommendation calls for increasing the trigger for 5-year mandatory drug penalties from
          5 grams to 25 grams for crack cocaine -- and dropping the trigger from 500 to 250 grams
          for powder cocaine. The President has asked the Attorney General and Drug Director to
          consult and work with Members of Congress on this matter.

     Background
          Current federal law requires a 5-year mandatory sentence for trafficking in 500 grams of
           powder cocaine, but imposes the same sentence for only 5 grams of crack cocaine.

           On May 1,1995 the U.S. Sentencing Commission proposed equalizing penalties for crack
            and powder cocaine at 500 grams -- substantially reducing the penalties for crack.
            President Clinton proposed and signed legislation which rejected these recommendations
            and directed the Sentencing Commission to submit new recommendations that retained
            tougher sentences for crack..

           On April 29th, the Sentencing Commission issued a revised report that proposed reducing
            the triggering amount for 5-year mandatory drug penalties for crack from the current 5
            grams to between 25 and 75 grams -- and decreasing this trigger for powder from the
            current 500 grams to between 125 and 375 grams.

           In response, the President asked the Attorney General and Drug Director to review the
            Sentencing Commission's recommendations and report back to him in 60 days. He also
            reiterated the Administration's position that -- while some adjustment to cocaine penalties
            is warranted -- our sentencing laws should continue to reflect that crack-is a more
            dangerous form of cocaine and that tougher sentences are appropriate. Moreover, our
            cocaine sentencing policy should ensure that federal law enforcement resources target
            mid- and high-level drug traffickers.

           On July 3rd, the Attorney General and Drug Director recommended that the President
            support reducing the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences by: (1)
            increasing the trigger for 5-year mandatory drug penalties from 5 to 25 grams for crack;
            and (2) dropping the trigger from 500 to 250 grams for powder. This revised structure
            maintains tough sentences for serious drug offenders; properly focuses federal law
            enforcement efforts on mid- and high-level drug traffickers; addresses perceptions of
            unfairness with the current disparity; and continues to reflect that crack -- because it is
            more likely to be associated with violence -- is more a dangerous form of cocaine.
