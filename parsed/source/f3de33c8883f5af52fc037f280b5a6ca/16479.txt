FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      JULY 29, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT

The House Rules Committee approved a rule which, if approved on the floor,
will allow the House leadership to consider the reconciliation spending
Conference Report at the Rules Committee Wednesday morning and take it to
the floor immediately thereafter.  Under the House rules, consideration of
a bill must occur the day following Rules Committee action unless a 2/3rds
majority votes to approve same day consideration.  The Rules Committee
action today would allow the House to get around the 2/3rds majority n
eeded to waive the House Rule with a simple majority vote.  This will
allow the House to complete consideration of both the tax and spending
Conference Reports by close of business Thursday.  House Minority members
are very opposed to this action because it does not protect their ability
to review the Conference Report before it is considered on the House
floor.

There are no similar restraints in the Senate. As soon as 100 copies of
either Conference Report are available, the Senate can begin the ten hours
of debate on that Conference Report.

CONGRESS TODAY (7/29)

the Air National Guard and provide $214 million for deficit reduction.
o       Rejected (voice vote) Nadler amendment that would have reduced

o       Approved (voice vote) Traficant amendment that requires NATO
members to pay their fair share for any NATO expansion and require that
appropriated funds be spent only for programs and amounts authorized.
o       Withdrew Clayton amendment that would authorize the Army to pay
for shipment of personal items of Guard and Reservists from Bosnia back to
the U.S. (agreement to work in conference to resolve the issue).
o       Approved (voice vote) Obey amendment that prevents the export of
F-22 technology to foreign countries.
o       Approved (voice vote) Kennedy amendment that prevents the use of
the DoD DNA database for genetic discrimination against soldiers.
