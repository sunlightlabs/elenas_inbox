                   New Clinton Administration Firearms Initiatives
                                          March 5,1996


Announcement:
Today, President Clinton announced 3 measures that he is taking to protect our children,
neighbors, and law enforcement from gun violence and accidents:

       1) Issued a Directive to all Federal Agencies and Departments requiring child safety
       locks and proper instructions with every handgun issued to a law enforcement agent;

       2) Instituted important changes to Federal firearms law requiring greater proof of
       residency before purchasing a firearm; and

       3) Announced that he would send legislation banning "Cop Killer" bullets to Congress
       this week.

Child Safety Locks:
      A child safety lock is a trigger lock or other safety device designed to prevent the
       unauthorized use of a firearm. The President's "Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of
       1997" would expand use of child safety locks by requiring that all Federal Firearms
       Dealers provide a child safety lock device with every handgun they sell. Today's
       Directive would take the first step in that direction by making this a universally-adopted
       safety policy across the Federal government.

      The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimate that nearly 1.2 million unsupervised
       children have access to loaded and unlocked firearms in their homes. And
       approximately 1,000 children and teens attempt suicide each year with a firearms-- over
       75% of them are successful. In 1991, GAO determined that a child-proof handgun safety
       device could have prevented all the accidents in which children under the age of 6 killed
       themselves or others.

Tighter Regulations on Gun Sales:
As a result of the recent tragedy at the Empire State Building, President Clinton directed
Treasury Secretary Rubin to review the circumstances and report back on whether and how to
restrict gun access to foreign visitors and, more broadly, to tighten up residency requirements.
In response, Rubin sent the following recommendations to the President:

       I) Amend the form all gun purchasers are required to complete so that it will be necessary
       for purchasers to attest that they are, in fact, residents of the state in which they are
       purchasing the firearm. In the case of aliens, this would require that they meet the 90
       residency requirement currently stipulated in the regulations.

       2) That the regulations governing the establishment of residency be amended to include
       requirements that all gun purchasers establish proof of residency through a photo
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
       identification and the use of substantiating documentation (e.g. utility bills). In case of
       aliens, they would have to establish 90 days of residency to reflect current law.


Cop Killer Bullets
     Criminals should not have access to handgun ammunition that can pierce bullet-proof
      vests worn by law enforcement officers. Although current law provides limits on
      ammunition based on the specific materials from which it is made, it does not address the
      problem of excessively powerful ammunition based on its performance.

      President Clinton's legislation directs the Secretary of Treasury to promulgate regulations
       that will prohibit the manufacture, importation, and distribution of handgun ammunition
       that can pierce standard bullet-proof vests.

      In developing these regulations, the Secretary will consult with law enforcement, body
       armor and ammunition manufactures, sporting groups, and the academic research
       community. In addition, Congress is provided a 45-day opportunity to review the
       regulations and disapprove of them. This legislation would limit the availability of this
       ammunition without affecting the needs of legitimate sporting enthusiasts. Most
       importantly, it will save police officers' lives.
