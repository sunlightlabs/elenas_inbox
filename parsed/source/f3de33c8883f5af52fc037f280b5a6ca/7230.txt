Subject:         Feedback from the Caucuses on Needle Exchange

There appears to be a press conference in the works for Friday by the CBC
on this issue.
I will provide more details as they come in.  As anyone other than myself
been in touch with them to help articulate our position?

Subject:-         Feedback from the Caucuses on Needle Exchange

I spoke with Becerra on this issue--he said he spoke with Shalala
yesterday and indicated to her that he was glad that the science had been
affirmed but where was the money? He did say that while he hadn't really
heard from members, he didn't anticipate a Caucus statement or press
conference saying that some of the members were conservative and not in
favor of the needle exchange program. He did suggest that matching
localities with private sources of funding would be a good thing.  Below
is Minyon's note re her conversation with Waters.

As a follow-up to your call, I spoke with Maxine.   They haven't taken an
official position on the Administrations announcement,   but anticipate
meeting late tonight or tomorrow to discuss their response. She indicated
that she has rec'd pressure from many members re: federal funding and the
impact on minority communities.    She further stated she wanted to have a
longer discussion with Charles Rangel. She indicated that more than
likely they will issue a press statement or do a press conference once
consensus has been met. Asked if I wanted a heads up (response why
course) .

Maria she and Becerra will be talking.

Note   the correction is the answer to the first question:

Because the science is now there to make these findings.  We already knew
that needle exchange programs can help reduce the rate of HIV transmissions
, and yesterday, the Secretary made clear that the scientists, including
all the respected leadership within the National Institutes of Health,
have concluded that these programs do not increase drug use.

                                   Needle Exchange Q&As                             onvelS/on'       .
                                       April 21, 1998


     Q:       Why did the Administration choose to issue the f"mdings that needle exchange
              programs reduce DIV transmission and does not increase drug use
              yesterday?

     A:       Because the science is now there to make these findings. We already knew that
              needle exchange programs can help reduce the rate of HIV transmissions, and
              yesterday, the Secretary made clear that the scientists, including all the respected
              leadership within the National Institutes of Health, have concluded that these
              programs do not increase drug use. Communities around the country, who are
              making their own decisions on this issue, should know that appropriately designed
              needle exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and do not encourage illegal
              drug use.


     Q:       If the science concludes that needle exchange programs reduce the
              transmission of DIV and do not increase drug use, why aren't you releasing
              federal funds for needle exchange programs?

     A:       We have always said that communities should make their own decisions on this
              issue, based on their own circumstances and using the best available scientific
              information. Releasing federal funding for needle exchange would have
              inappropriately shifted the focus away from communities .- where these decisions
              should be made -- to the national level. That could have severely undermined or
              threatened local programs that are currently in place, and hindered additional
              communities from deciding to put these programs into place. At the same time,
              such federal action could send an inappropriate message about the acceptability of
              drug use .· a message that is not sent when an individual community decides, on
              the basis of its unique circumstances, that a particular, carefully designed needle
              exchange program advances public health interests. For these reasons, the
              Administration concluded that it should simply give the scientific guidance that is
              necessary for communities to make their own decisions, rather than federalize the
              needle exchange issue.


Background:

              Congress gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services the responsibility to
              make two determinations: whether the scientific research findings conclude that
              needle exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and whether they increase
              drug use. In 1997, the Secretary made a determination that needle exchange
                                             Hex,Qump Conv(:Ifsion
     programs do reduce the transmission of HIV. Yesterday, the Secretary held a
     meeting with her senior scientific advisors, including Nobel Laureate and head of
     the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Harold Varmus. These scientists agreed
     that the science-based standards have been met with regard to drug use as well.


Q:   Isn't it hypocritical to say that needle exchange saves lives, but that the
     federal government will not pay for needle exchange programs?

A:   No. In making her announcement yesterday, the Secretary informed local
     communities that under certain conditions, needle exchange programs can reduce
     HIV transmission and not encourage drug use. The decision as to whether to
     adopt such programs is up to these communities, based on their own unique
     circumstances. The Administration did not want to imperil local decision making
     by bringing needle exchange up to' the national level. Neither did the
     Administration want to take the risk that federalizing needle exchange would send
     a mixed message about drug use.


Q:   Won't this send a message to young people that drugs -- especially injectable
     drugs like heroin -- are ok?

A:   Absolutely not. Injectable drug use is illegal, unhealthy and wrong. It is clearly
     a major health problem as well as a significant law enforcement concern. That is
     why this Administration has consistently sent a unified message to all Americans,
     particularly young people: Drugs put your future at risk; they can kill you; and
     they can infect you with HIV. And that is part of the reason why the
     Administration will not release federal funding for needle exchange. National
     action could send a mixed message on drug use that individual local actions,
     based on and responding to particular circumstances, willnot.

     Of course, this Administration has an extremely strong record on fighting drugs.
     We have increased the availability of drug treatment. We have worked in
     partnership with communities to fight drugs in and around schools. We have
     worked with state and local governments to put 100,000 more police officers on
     the streets, and we have doubled the number of border guards. We will continue
     to fight drug use in this country and to offer drug treatment to those who are
     addicted so that they stop using drugs.


Q:   Wasn't the decision not to federally fund needle exchange programs based on
     political considerations?

A:   The decision was based on a belief that communities should decide for themselves
     whether to adopt needle exchange programs, based on their own local
                                          Hllk-Dump Convc.sion .

     circumstances and the best scientific evidence possible. We did fear that
     federalizing needle exchange would imperil such local decision making, by
     igniting a congressional battle on the subject. To that extent, the
     Administration's decision took into account political realities. But first and
     foremost, the decision resulted from a commitment to real, locally-based decision
     making on this subject.


Q:   Isn't the Administration decision essentially an attempt to reach a
     compromise that both Secretary Shalala and General McCaffrey can sign on
     to?

A:   No. Of course both the General and the Secretary support the Administration's
     decision. . But that decision was a result of (1) scientific evidence about needle
     exchange and (2) a belief that needle exchange should be a local,
     community-based decision.
