Q.   What were the new teen smoking data released today?

A.   Today, the Centers for Disease Control released new data on nicotine addiction and
     cigarette smoking patterns among teenagers. It confirmed that nicotine hooks our kids
     and creates an addiction that is extremely difficult to break, the same as it does with
     adults. Specifically, 86 percent of teens who smoke daily and try to quit are
     unsuccessful. Young people also underestimate the addictiveness of nicotine -- 75
     percent of daily smokers who expect to quit are still smoking five years later.. Obviously,
     this addiction may have very serious implications for their long-term health and threaten
     their very lives. Today's report "Cigarette Smoking Behavior and Nicotine Addiction
     Among Teens" in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report just provides one more
     reason why the Senate needs to pass the McCain legislation in order to dramatically
     reduce youth smoking in this country..

Q.   How many teens smoke in this country and at what rate?

A.   Currently, 36.4 percent of high school students have smoked one or more days in the past
     month. Of adolescents who have ever tried smoking (70 percent), more than a third go
     on to become daily smokers during high school.

                Why the Senate Should Pass the McCain Tobacco Legislation
                               May 21,1998 -- DRAFT 5120

New statistics released today by the Centers for Disease Control confirm that nicotine hooks
American children and creates an addiction that is extremely difficult to break. The data show
that 86 percent of teens who smoke daily and try to quit are unsuccessful. Young people also
underestimate the addictiveness of nicotine -- 75 percent of daily smokers who expect to quit are
still smoking five years later. For many young people, this addiction has very serious
implications for their long-term health and threatens their very lives.

Every day, 3000 young people become regular smokers in this country, and 1000 will die
prematurely as a result. Today's report provides just one more reason why the Senate needs to .
pass the McCain legislation this week in order to dramatically reduce youth smoking in this
country. Yesterday, the President said he believes the McCain bill a good, strong bill that will
make a real dent in teen smoking and he urged Congress should pass it without delay. In
particular, he praised the significant improvements made to the new bill, including:

              Tough industry-wide and company-specific lookback surcharges that will finally
               make reducing youth smoking the tobacco companies' bottom line;

              Protection for all Americans from the health hazards of secondhand smoke;

             No antitrust exemption for the tobacco industry;

              Strong licensing and anti-smuggling provisions to prevent the emergence of
               contraband markets and to prosecute violators;

              A dedicated fund to provide for a substantial increase in health research funding, a
               demonstration to test promising new cancer treatments, a nationwide
               counteradvertising campaign to reduce youth smoking, effective state and local
               programs in tobacco education, prevention, and cessation, law enforcement efforts
               to prevent smuggling and crack down on retailers who sell tobacco products to
               children, assistance for tobacco farmers and their communities, and funds for the
               states to make additional efforts to promote public health and protect children;
               and

             The elimination of immunity for parent companies of tobacco manufacturers, an
              increase in the cap on legal damages to $8 billion per year, and changes to ensure
              that the cap will be available only to tobacco companies that change the way they
              do business, by agreeing to accept sweeping restrictions on advertising, continue
              making annual payments and lookback surcharges even if those provisions are
              struck down, make substantial progress toward meeting the youth smoking
              reduction targets, prevent their top management from taking part in any scheme to
              promote smuggling, and abide by the terms of the legislation rather than
              challenging it in court.
