        PRESIDENT CLINTON: Protecting Our Children from Violence and Drugs
                              December 6, 1997

In today's radio address, the President: 1) highlighted new tools recently signed into law to
combat youth violence and drug use; 2) renewed his challenge to Congress to pass
comprehensive juvenile crime legislation; and 3) called on the Attorney General and Secretary of
Education to issue an annual report on violence in our schools.

New Tools to Protect Our Youth from Violence and Drugs. The President recently signed into
law many of his key initiatives to give communities, schools, and families new tools to help keep
kids safe from violence and away from drugs.

      More Prosecutors and Probation Officers. Over $110 million is available in targeted
       funding for prosecutors to curb gang violence, and for juvenile courts to help fund
       probation officers-- key elements of the President's Anti-Gang Youth Violence Strategy.

      Unprecedented Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The Administration secured $195 million
       to launch a national campaign to focus the full power of the media to get the right
       message to kids on illegal drug use: drugs are wrong, and they can kill you.

      New After School Programs. The new spending bill provides $40 million to fund after
       schools initiatives proposed by the President to keep schools open in the after school
       hours when most violent juvenile crimes are committed.

Pushing Congress to Enact Comprehensive Juvenile Crime Legislation. While recently
signed appropriations measures are a critical first step, a long~term strategy to attack youth
violence and gangs-- similar to the successful Boston model-- is still needed. The President
challenged Congress to pass such a youth violence bill that includes measures to: bar violent
juveniles from buying a gun on their 21st birthday; expand use of racketeering statutes (i.e.,
RICO) for gang-related offenses; and increase penalties for using kids to sell drugs, selling drugs
to kids, or selling drugs in or near a school.

Taking on Violence and Drugs in Schools. The President is committed to building safer
communities and above all, making sure that drugs and violence are kept out of our schools.

      Establishing an annual report card on crime in schools. While a patchwork of useful
       studies and surveys exists, there is no annual baseline of violence in schools available for
       parents, schools, and lawmakers~ Moreover, there is no regular measure of homicides in
       schools. President Clinton called on the Attorney General and Secretary of Education to
       report to him within 60 days with a plan for developing an annual, comprehensive study
       on crime and violence in our nation's schools.

      A record of creating safe, disciplined and drug-free schools. The Clinton administration
       has worked hard to make our schools safer through the Gun-Free Schools Act, teaching
       kids that drugs are wrong through the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program, and restoring
       discipline and order through promoting school uniforms and curfews.
