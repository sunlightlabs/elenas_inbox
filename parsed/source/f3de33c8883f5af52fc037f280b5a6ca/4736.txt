     Elena, et. al.:

     Attached please find a one-pager I did for press/comm. for the radio
     address to be taped tomorrow at 2:30pm.  I told Anne Lewis that I'd get it
     to her by about noon.  It's not too eventful, interesting, etc., but let
     me know you're thoughts.

     EK -- if you hadn't heard late today; the radio address in on the
     Treasury/Postal approps and its inclusion of the anti-drug media
     campaign. Also, Leanne will send Q/A's on this separately for review.   It
     will be largely based on some ONDCP factoids, and will probably also serve
     as our submission for the press conference (they requested a domestic drug
     prevention Q/A, and what could be more appropriate for Saturday in Brazil
        but info related to the previously taped radio address.  Right?

     MC -- I have no idea where Rahm is on this somewhat ad hoc plan for the
     radio address. Any thoughts? I imagine a draft speech will be circulated
     in the morn.

     Jose'

         LAUNCHING THE PRESIDENT'S ANT-DRUG MEDIA CAMPAIGN
                          OCTOBER 11, 1997

                                The number one priority in the President's
    The President's First Priority_
    1997 National Drug Control Strategy is to motivate our kids to reject the use
    of illegal drugs. That's why his Drug Strategy and Balanced Budget
    included substantial funds for an unprecedented, paid media campaign
    to teach our kids about the dangers of drug use.

   Media Campaign Now Law.          Yesterday, by signing the Treasury and
    Postal Appropriations bill into law, the President officially launched his
    media campaign. Working with Congress, the private sector and others,
    the Office of National Drug Control Policy will now begin to shape specific
    drug-related messages to virtually all of the nations youth (ages 9-17).

   Why a Paid Media Campaign?      There are several important reasons why
    President Clinton has proposed a paid media campaign:

           (1) More kids using drugs.   While overall drug use is down 50
           percent over the last 15 years, adolescent drug use has been rising
           -- and the perceived risks of drug use falling -- since 1990;

           (2) Fewer anti-drug messages.   Free public service announcements
           (PSAs) are down by about 30 percent, and almost none are now
           aired during prime time viewing hours; and

           (3) Need for a targeted, updated strategy. The media campaign
           will allow us to target specific programs or time slots that attract the
           young viewers we need to reach. And it will allow us to utilize
           modern media -- such as the internet -- to make sure our message is
           getting out to everyone.

   Reaching Kids Early.   Statistical evidence shows that if a child can reach
    the age of 21 without using drugs, he or she will probably never use them.
    And studies also show that children who use drugs are even more likely to
    use other and more serious drugs. In fact, a recent study by Columbia
    University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) showed
    that kids who smoke marijuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine
    than kids who did not.

   Having the Right Tools. The President's media campaign is designed to
    give government the same resources and tools to help kids reject illegal
    drugs that advertising agencies use ever day to market consumer
    products and foods. That's the least we can do.
