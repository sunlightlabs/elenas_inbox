MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Elena Kagan
              Paul Weinstein

SUBJECT:      Update on Community Empowerment Agenda

The following memorandum discusses the latest developments concerning your Community
Empowerment Agenda:

  1. Economic Development That Works

          Unemployment Has Started to Decline in Cities --Unemployment, from 1993 to
           1996, dropped more in central cities than in their surrounding suburbs --and each
           of the ten largest American cities has a lower unemployment rate today than in
           1993. [Bureau of Labor Statistics, Local Area Unemployment Statistics, as cited
           in the State of the Cities Overview, 6/23/97]

         After Years on the Rise, the Poverty Rate Has Decreased
          Slightly --Nationwide the poverty rate in cities rose 50 percent from 14.2 percent
          in 1970 to 21.5 percent in 1993. From 1993 to 1995, there was a slight decline to
          20.6 percent. [Census data cited in the State of the Cities Overview, 6/23/97]

   2. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFD Fund)

         Second Round Awards -- The CDFI Fund is in the process of reviewing its
          second round of applications. The Fund is expected to make over $30 million in
          awards before October 1.

        CDFI Fund Budget Increase -- The House has voted to fully fund the CDFI
         program at $125 million for FY98. However, the Senate has not provided any
         money for the CDFI Fund. The House-Senate Conference is tentatively
         scheduled for September.

        CDFI Fund's First Round --The Community Development Banks and Financial
         Institutions Fund's (CDFI) first round of awards totaled $37.2 million in
         investments in 32 CDFIs, including community development banks, loan funds,
         credit unions, venture capital funds, and microenterprise loan funds. In the next
         two to three years the CDFI Fund's investments are expected to leverage three to
         four times the investments in total capital raised for these institutions. Over the
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

        long tenn, the Fund's investments are expected to leverage 10 to 20 times more
        activity by the CDFls.

3. Empowerment Zones

       New Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities: The reconciliation
        bill includes a second round of Empowennent Zones -- 15 urban and 5 rural EZs.
        The new EZs will benefit from a different blend of tax credits from the first-round
        EZs. They will be eligible for the Brownfields tax incentive, special expensing of
        business assets, and qualification for private-activity bonds. The legislation also
        includes funding for two new EZs with the existing Empowennent Zone tax
        incentives. The cost of the tax incentives is $717 million. We will be working
        closely with the NEC, HUD, USDA, Treasury, and others on setting up the
        selection process.

3. Brownfields Initiative

    Brownfields Tax Incentive -- The reconciliation bill includes your proposed tax
     incentive for Brownfields. This incentive reduces costs by pennitting clean-up costs to
     be deducted immediately for tax purposes. This will, in tum, encourage redevelopment
     of these areas. The tax incentive will be available for three years. The Treasury
     Department estimates that this $500 million tax incentive would allow $1.5 billion
     in expensing, leverage more than $6 billion for private sector cleanups nationwide,
     and allow redevelopment of 14,000 brownfields.
