                             TALKING POINTS FOR TOBACCO SPEECH
                                         March 30,1998



        Thank you Mike Barnes for that warm introduction.


        As many of you know, I am not generally the Administration's
spokesperson on issues like tobacco. But I am here today, not only as
the Chief of Staff of this Administration, but as a businessman, as a
North Carolinian, and as a parent, to talk to you about the President's
plan to protect our children from tobacco.


        Consider these facts:


                Smoking kills 430,000 people every year -- it kills more people
                 than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and
                 fires combined. Smoking is still by far the largest preventable
                 cause of premature death in the United States.


                Nearly 90% of smokers started smoking before they turned 18.

                                           -1-
           five years after starting -- yet only one in five actually manages to
           quit.


          Every day, 3,000 young people will become reg.ular smokers, and
           1,000 will die sooner as a result.


     At the same time, multi-million dollar marketing campaigns have
been designed to get our children to light their first cigarettes.


         In the past months, new documents have come to light that
          conclusively prove that tobacco companies aimed to sell their
           deadly products to children as young as 12.


         These documents are a shocking reminder that our children are
          under siege by a deadly and powerful enemy -- and it is up to us to
          protect our children.

threat of tobacco is right at the top of the President's agenda -- and this
administration is fully committed to working with the bipartisan
leadership in Congress to achieve this goal.


          This is not a matter of politics --- it is a matter of priorities. Many
           Members of Congress from both parties have shown enormous
           leadership on this most important issue.


          Congressman Waxman has been in the forefront of this issue for
           years -- providing the powerful leadership it took to bring us to the
           critical point we have reached today.


          Congressman Bliley has recently done the American people a great
           service by getting thousands of pages of documents from the
           tobacco companies posted on the Internet so all the world can see
           how the tobacco companies have gone after our children.




                                               -3-

    worked long and hard to introduce tobacco legislation that this
    Administration can support.


   Senator McCain [and Senator Hollings] has/have provided great
    leadership in the Commerce Committee to put together a bipartisan
    bill that embodies the President's principals.


   We must not let protecting our children's lives become an election
    year political fight. It must be a national commitment of the
    highest priority.

-- and experience shows -- is the best way to stop young Americans from
smoking before they start. His plan would:


         Raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over 5 years and
          $1.50 a pack over the next ten years;


         Affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;


         Impose strict restrictions on advertising aimed at young people; and


         Assess stiff penalties for selling cigarettes to minors.

stop teenage smoking will save 1 million lives over the next five years.


         Last week, Vice President Gore announced that new estimates show
           that our proposal would have major effects on youth smoking in
          every state, with reductions ranging from 33% in Washington State
           to 51 % in Kentucky.


         For every dime added to the price of cigarettes over a 5 year period,
          up to 270,000 fewer teenagers will begin smoking and more than
           90,000 premature deaths will be avoided.


         Price increases alone are projected to reduce teenage smoking over
          the next 5 years by 29%. Youth access and marketing restrictions
          in the President's plan are projected to reduce teenage smoking by
          an additional 11 %.

        plan plus the tighter restrictions on youth access and marketing, will
        reduce the number of youths smoking by 3 million between now
        and 2003 --' and help us avoid approximately 1 million premature
        deaths.




    Tobacco companies must also be part of the solution.


        As the President has said, advertising aimed at adults is legal, but
         tobacco companies must draw the line at our children.


        Our proposal requires tobacco companies to help establish
         smoking cessation programs for adult smokers, and to launch
         public education campaigns aimed at children to keep them from
         smoking in the first place.

is tragic -- and as a businessman, I can tell you that the economic cost to
our society is extraordinarily high.


               Smoking related illness costs approximately $60 billion every
               year -- that's more than the federal govemmenfspends on
               education, child care, and medical research combined.


               Smoking during pregnancy results in 2,500 fetal deaths every
               year, and costs $4 billion per year -- this amount is close to
               double what we spend on cancer research each year.


              Fires caused by smokers cost another $500 million every year;


               Smokers die earlier and retire sooner -- and this is estimated to
               cost our economy as much as $80 billion every year in lost output,
               lost productivity, and lost wages.


     These costs rob our economy and cheat the American people out of
their hard-earned tax dollars. But if we pass the President's plan, we will

and most importantly, saving lives.


     We know that this plan will be good for America -- and as a North
Carolinian -- born and raised in tobacco country -- I can tell you that we
must also make sure that we treat our tobacco farmers fairly.


            The President has made protecting tobacco farmers and their
             communities one of the five key elements for his plan for
             comprehensive tobacco legislation.

         public and protecting the well-being of farming communities.
         Recently, a remarkable coalition of farming groups, including
         burley and flue-cured growers, and public health groups,
         including the American Heart Association and the American
         Cancer Society, came together around a shared set of
         principles. That is a consensus we can build on.


        We will use some of the revenue from raising the price of
         cigarettes to make sure that we save our kids without
         devastating our farm communities.     That is a commitment
         this Administration has made, and we are optimistic that a
         consensus is forming in Congress to use some of this money to
         help tobacco farmers.

budget in 30 years. This budget protects our children from the harms
of tobacco -- and our nation from the burdensome costs associated with
teen smoking.        This budget also uses the very money raised by raising
the price of cigarettes to invest in the future of our nation. Our budget
uses the tobacco money for:

          Critical investments in health research, including biomedical
           research, cancer clinical trials, and children's health outreach --
           increasing by nearly 50% the funding for the National Institutes of
           Health.


          We also make historic investments in child care and after-school care
            -- doubling the number of working families who receive child care,
           and significantly increasing the number of students receiving after
           school care; and lastly,

               rehabilitating 5,000 schools;




       Finally, and most importantly, as a parent of three kids, I can tell you
that when I hear the statistics I mentioned earlier, my blood runs cold.


              When I saw the documents that showed thattobacco companies
               had deliberately tried to get our children to smoke -- despite the
               fact that a full third of the 3,000 kids who start smoking every day
               will die prematurely -- I knew then and there that we must not rest
               until we have done everything we can to protect our children from
               tobacco.

over the next five years. We must not miss this historic opportunity.


            As President Clinton recently said: "We stand on the verge of one
             of the greatest public health achievements in history -- an historic
             triumph in our fight to protect America's children from the deadly
             threat of tobacco."




            As Chief of Staff of this Administration, as a businessman, as a
             North Carolinian, as a parent, and as an American -- I ask you to
             support our efforts, and to work with us in a bipartisan manner to
             meet this vitally important challenge.


     Thank you.
