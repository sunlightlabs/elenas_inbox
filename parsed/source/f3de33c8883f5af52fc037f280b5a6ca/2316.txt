I.    PURPOSE

      To announce that more than 100 companies have accepted your welfare to work challenge
      and to promote your $600 million welfare to work transportation proposal.       .

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will be addressing CEOs and senior executives from over 100 companies that have
      joined the Welfare to Work Partnership. The Welfare to Work Partnership is an
      independent, nonpartisan,national effort which has pledged to enlist 1,000 companies
      within the next six months to help move those on public assistance into jobs in the
      private sector. The Partnership was formed in response to your challenge in the State of
      the Union, and the CEOs from the companies you noted in that speech -- Sprint,
      Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United Airlines -- form the Partnership's Board of
      Directors.     At this event, United Airlines Corporation CEO Gerald Greenwald will be
      named the Chairman of the Board.

      Citing transportation as one of the biggest barriers in moving from welfare to work, you
      will announce that the Department of Transportation is awarding grants to 24 states to
      develop strategies to solve this problem. In addition, you will urge Congress to enact
      your $600 million welfare to work transportation initiative, which is part of the
      Administration's NEXTEA transportation proposal.

      This is also an opportunity to praise two of your key welfare to work initiatives included
      in the budget agreement: 1) the $3 billion Welfare to Work fund for cities and states to
      create job opportunities for welfare recipients; and 2) the enhanced tax credit which
      would give companies that hire long-term welfare recipients a 50 tax credit on the first
      $10,000 of wages paid over two years.

        Today President Clinton announced that over 100 companies have accepted his State of the
Union challenge to forge "a new national effort to marshal America's businesses, large and small, to
create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work."

              CEOs and senior executives from over 100 companies joined the President to launch the
               Welfare to Work Partnership, a private, non-profit organization which will lead the
               national business effort to hire people from the welfare rolls. The Partnership pledged
               to enlist 1,000 companies within the next six months and named United Airlines
               Corporation CEO Gerald Greenwald its Chairman of the Board.

              Citing transportation as one of the biggest barriers in moving from welfare to work,
               President Clinton today announced grants to 24 states to develop strategies to solve this
               problem. The President urged Congress to enact his $600 million welfare to work
               transportation initiative, part of his NEXTEA transportation proposal, and he praised a
               similar bipartisan bill introduced today by Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Frank R.
               Lautenberg (D-NJ).

              The President praised the new budget agreement which includes two critical welfare to
               work initiatives. The first is a $3 billion Welfare to Work fund for cities and states to
               create jobs and provide incentives for employment. This proposal, a centerpiece of the
               President's second-term agenda, will help move one million adults from welfare to work.
               . The budget agreement also includes the President's proposed enhanced tax credit
               which would give companies that hire long-term welfare recipients a 50 tax credit on
               the first $10,000 of wages paid over two years.

              To ensure that former welfare recipients succeed in the workplace, Vice President Gore
               announced a new campaign, beginning with a conference on May 29th, to help those
               who leave welfare retain jobs.

        The President was joined today by the Vice President, Mr. Greenwald, Partnership President Eli
J. Segal, Delaware Governor Tom Carper, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, and small
business owner George R. Stinson of Racine, Wisconsin, whose company workforce is more than half
former welfare recipients.

The Welfare to Work Partnership
        The Welfare to Work Partnership is an independent, nonpartisan, national effort of the
American business community to help move those on public assistance into jobs in the private sector.
The Partnership will provide information, technical assistance, and support for all interested companies.
  The Partnership was formed in response to the President's challenge in his 1997 State of the Union
speech, and the CEOs from the five companies the President noted in that speech -- Sprint, Monsanto,
UPS, Burger King, and United Airlines -- form the Partnership's Board of Directors.         Since signing
the welfare law last August, the President has launched an aggressive campaign to challenge both the
public and private sector to help welfare reform succeed. The President signaled his commitment to
work with the corporate community by holding a White House meeting with 14 coIT\pany CEOs in
work effort.


The President's Welfare to Work Transportation Initiative
        One of the biggest barriers faced by people moving from welfare to work is finding
transportation. Two-thirds of new jobs are in the suburbs, but three of four welfare recipients live in
rural areas or central cities. Only six percent of welfare recipients own cars, and public transit often
provides inadequate connections to job and training centers.

        To combat this problem, the President today urged Congress to adopt the six-year, $600
million grant program in his NEXTEA transportation bill that would support flexible, innovative
transportation systems in rural, urban, and suburban areas to get people where the jobs are. A similar
bill was introduced today in the Senate by Senators Arlen Specter (R-Pa) and Frank R. Lautenberg
(D-NJ). Today, the President also announced grants to 24 states and the Virgin Islands to develop
welfare to work transportation plans. The grants are being awarded by the Department of
Transportation's Federal Transit Administration and the Federal Highway Administration in cooperation
with the National Governors' Association.
