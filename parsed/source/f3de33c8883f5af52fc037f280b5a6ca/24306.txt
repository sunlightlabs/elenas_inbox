                      Poverty Measurement Policy Working Group -- May 26                 IOn        rn

The primary purpose of this meeting is to try and reach consensus around a key set of policy
recommendations related to the issues our group has been discussing over the past three months.
These are recommendations to the Census about how they might present their alternative poverty
measurement calculations. Attached to this agenda is a one-page summary ofthe NAS
recommendations for a new poverty line measure, and a one-page summary of the four policy issues
we've discussed at our last four meetings.

                                              AGENDA
I. Key issues to be discussed

A. How should the thresholds be determined in the first year an alternative measure is published?
To be specific: should the alternative poverty rate be benchmarked in 1997 to be identical to the 1997
official poverty rate or is there an alternative "benchmark" that makes more sense?
(Note: We appear to have a general consensus within the group from our earlier discussions to support
benchmarking the alternative poverty rate to the 1997 official rate.)

B. How should the poverty thresholds be updated over time? Specifically, (1) should they be
adjusted on an annual basis by the overall cpr or by a cpr for food shelter & clothing only and
revisited every 5-10 years for a more complete recalculation; or (2) Should they be completely
recalculated each year as a share of current expenditures on food, clothing, and housing?
(Note: There seemed to be general consensus for the first approach, particularly if a cpr for food,
shelter and clothing was used. OMB seemed reasonably confident that they and Census could
establish a process to assure that poverty measurement is reviewed on a regular basis.)

C. Should the poverty thresholds be adjusted for geographic variations in the cost of living?
(Note: There seemed to be general consensus that any "base" alternative poverty measurement should
not include geographical price variation, although Census may well want to publish an alternative that
includes this as part of the NAS recommendations.)

D. How (if at aU) should the adjustment for Medical out-of-pocket (MOOP) expenditures
occur? Specifically, should the Census follow the NAS recommendations to impute MOOP and
subtract it from individual income before calculating individual poverty status?
(Note: There is more disagreement on this issue than on any other. The three deputies present at our
last meeting generally agreed that the Census should follow the NAS recommendations for now, but
that further work refining these calculations (and considering other alternatives) should go forward.
But some of the staff present at the meeting were in less agreernent.)

E. Do we have any recommendations to Census about how to present their alternative poverty
calculations? Specifically, do we want to recommend they present a primary "base" alternative
poverty calculation (for instance: benchmarked to 1997, updated by the cpr for necessities, without
geographic price variation, and including MOOP), and then a few alternatives (with and without
MOOP, with and without geographic price variation)?

II. Process from here.

A poverty measure consists of two pieces: (1) A definition of family resources, and (2) A poverty
threshold against which resources are compared. If resources are below the threshold, a family is
considered poor.

(1) Derming Family Resources

Family resources = Cash income

+ Near money in-kind benefits (food stamps, housing subsidies, school lunch, LIHEAP, etc)

- Taxes

- Child care costs (for families in which there is no nonworking parent, with a cap, and not to
                        exceed the earnings of the parent with lower earnings)

- Work expenses (a flat amount per week of work)

- Child support payments

- Out of pocket medical care expenditures, including health insurance premiums.

(2) Derming a Poverty Threshold

The threshold should be determined for a family of four (two adults and two children) based on a point
in the distribution of annual expenditures by such families on food, clothing, and shelter, plus a small
multiplier. (This is based on Consumer Expenditure Survey data, probably using a three-year average
to guarantee adequate sample size.) The recommended percentage of annual expenditures is between
30 and 35 percent (i.e., 15 to 20 percentage points below the median); recommended multipliers are
between 1.15 to 1.25.

Thresholds for other family sizes should be determined based on an equivalence scale calculation.
The NAS panel recommends using
                       Scale value = (A + PKl
where A is the number of adults and K the number of kids. P is the scaling for children (ifP=I, kids
are treated the same as adults); and F is the scaling for family size. The NAS panel recommends
P=0.70 and F in a range of 0.65 to 0.75.

Geographic costs ofliving are taking into account, based on a regional index of housing costs (which
varies by size of metropolitan area and region of country) which is weighted by the share of housing
costs in the expenditure bundle.

Over time, new poverty threshold should be updated by recalculating annual expenditures on the most
recent three years of data, and reapplying these other calculations using the most recent data available
on housing costs.

Agenda

I. How does the NAS propose to detennine thresholds?
    How does this compare to the current poverty line?

2. Comments on the fundamental indetenninancy of the "right" threshold ...
     Implies a range of thresholds are viable.

3. Benchmarking a threshold so poverty numbers in a specific year are unchanged.
      A. How do this?
      B. Why do this?
      C. What are the implications of benchmarking?
            a. Change history
            b. Change who is poor, even if the aggregate number is unchanged

4. What are the alternatives to benchmarking?
     NAS recommendations

5.   What are the criticisms ofthese different approaches?
**********************************
Pros of benchmarking:
There may be large political advantages to saying "We want to improve the measure of poverty, but to
show you that we're doing this in a non-political manner, we'll benchmark so there is no change in the
overall aggregate poverty rate in the year we implement this change." There are still those who will be
upset about the changes in the distribution of poverty or in the past history of poverty rates, which will
change (you can benchmark one year only.)

Cons of benchmarking
Backing out a threshold so that the current poverty rate is unchanged produces a threshold that is very
far down in the percentile distribution of expenditures on food, shelter and clothing -- somewhere
around 20-25% rather than the 30-35% range recommended by the NAS.

Pros of using the NAS alternative (which establishes a higher threshold and higher poverty rates)
Utilizes the recommendations of the NAS panel, based on their judgement about the accumulation of
evidence.

Maintains threshold levels that are very similar to the current thresholds (it's not clear how much this
matters given the resource definition has changed.)

Cons of using the NAS alternative
Results in a substantially higher poverty rate, which will draw an great deal of criticism. At the same
time, it has the same problems as benchmarking, in that it also changes history and it changes the
relative poverty share of different groups (although all subgroup poverty rates would go up.)

Agenda

1. How have the poverty thresholds been updated?
     CPI adjustments

2. What does the NAS recommend?
     Recalculating the threshold

3. What are the implications of these different approaches?
     Absolute poverty thresholds (current approach)
     Relatively-absolutely poverty thresholds (NAS approach)
     Relative poverty thresholds

4. What are the alternatives?
     A. Adjust with CPI
     B. Adjust with CPI but embed a commitment to recalculate thresholds
              on a regular basis.
     C. Utilize the relatively-absolute (NAS) technique annually

5. What are the criticisms of these different approaches?
*********************************************
Pros of a more relative approach (B or C above):
1. CPI-adjusted thresholds become obsolete over time. As standards ofliving change, so do social
norms.

2. If we don't create the expectation of a regular recalculation/update of the poverty line, we'll end up
in 30 years exactly where we are today, using an outmoded statistic.

3. Ifwe calculate the thresholds relative to some level ofrnedian expenditures on necessities, it is
most consistent if we update in the same way, i.e., with a procedure that changes the thresholds relative
to median expenditures on necessities.

Pros of CPI updating (A or B above):
I. Relative changes create a moving target of poverty. In the short run, one is most interested in
knowing how many people have purchasing power above a pre-set level. If the level changes with
standards ofliving, it's much harder to interpret the poverty statistics.

2. Standard ofliving changes (and social norm changes) occur only very slowly. Better to take them
into account every-so-often, rather than to embed them annually into the poverty rate.

3. Ifwe update with a CPI for necessities only (food, shelter, & clothing), we might capture most of
the relevant changes (since much of the change in expenditures on these items is due to price changes
rather than quantity changes) and have an easier time explaining the short run updating procedure.

1. How does the Census propose to do this?

2. What are the results of such an adjustment?

3. What are the alternatives?

     B. Publish an adjustment index for researchers who want to use it, but adjust
              neither the official poverty counts nor the guidelines
     C. Adjust both the official poverty counts and the guidelines

4. What are the criticisms of these different approaches?
**************************************
Reasons to adjust for geographic variation:

If the poverty thresholds provide a measure of "income needs" they should reflect cost of living
differences across regions. Theoretically, most statisticians/economists agree that such adjustments
should be done if the data is available.

Reasons not to adjust for geographic variation:

Adjustments in the thresholds can lead to a "slippery slope", with advocacy groups arguing that such
price adjustments should be done in a wide variety of program benefit payments as well. This can also
lead to much greater efforts by legislators to intervene in exactly how the "correct" regional price
adjustments are done.

Researchers would not be able to duplicate poverty counts based on geographic price variation because
the detailed geographic information required to calculate these would violate privacy constraints in
some cases.

Tentative consensus among the group:

* If Census decides that they want to publish a poverty count based on thresholds with geographical
price variation, we recommend that such an adjustment not be part of the "base" alternative poverty
count, but one of the alternatives.

* At some point in the future, should we discuss changing the poverty guidelines used for program
purposes, these should not include geographical price variation.

Agenda

1. How does the NAS propose to deal with MOOP expenditures?
     Why do it this way?

2. How does this affect poverty calculations?

3. What are the alternatives?
     A. Account for MOOP in the resource count (NAS)
     B. Account for MOOP in the thresholds

4. How does this issue interact with our measures and data concerning the broader question of health
and health care coverage?

5. What are the pros and cons of these approaches?
**********************************************
Pros of handling MOOP as recommended by the NAS (subtracting it from income):
* The NAS argues (and some of our group strongly agree) that it is better to remove MOOP from the
income side rather than add it into the threshold side.

* This is the approach that Census has investigated and can implement in a timely fashion.
* The alternative of ignoring MOOP entirely (neither taking account of it in the thresholds nor the
income side) has real credibility problems, given extensive attention to the problems of lack of
insurance and high out-of-pocket medical expenditures.

* Ifwe do this adjustment now, further changes that better take account ofMOOP in the future will
involve relatively small changes to the poverty numbers. If we don't do it now and want to take
account of MOOP in the base alternative in the future, it will involve a major realignment of numbers.

Cons of handling MOOP as recommended by the NAS:
* The data for imputing MOOP is not as recent as we'd like (although this will improve markedly in
the next few years.)

* Ifwe ignore MOOP entirely, benchmarking the poverty rate to the 1997 numbers will allow us to set
the thresholds at a share of expenditures that is closer to the NAS recommendations.

* Some of our group are strongly convinced that it would be better to include MOOP in the thresholds
rather than subtracting it from income, and would like to see this implemented.
