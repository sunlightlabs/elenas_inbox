          MORE JOBS, HIGHER WAGES, AND LOW INFLATION
    AMERICA'S ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW STEADY AND STRONG
                                                      February 6, 1998

TODAY, THE LABOR DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE ECONOMY CREATED
358,000 NEW JOBS LAST MONTH, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REMAINED AT A
24-YEAR LOW, AND WAGES CONTINUED TO RISE. The economy as strong as its been in a
generation. It is clear that President Clinton's three-part economic strategy -- reducing the deficit,
investing in our people, and tearing down foreign barriers to American goods -- is working for
America's working families.

      1.1 MILLION NEW JOBS IN PAST 3 MONTHS -- MORE THAN 14.7 MILLION NEW JOBS
       UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON In the past three months, the economy added 1.1 million
       new jobs -- 358,000 new jobs last month alone. During the Clinton Administration, the
       economy has added 14.7 million new jobs -- a faster annual rate of job growth (2.6 percent per
       year) than any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s. The economy has added 3.3
       million jobs over the past year. [Source: Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]
      STRONG PRIVATE-SECTOR JOB GROWTH. Last month, the economy added 349,000
       private-sector jobs. Since President Clinton took office, the private sector of the economy has added
       13.7 million new jobs -- with 3.0 million jobs added in the past year. Under President Clinton, 93
       percent of the 14.7 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector -- that's a
       higher percentage than any Administration since President Warren G. Harding. [Source: Based on data frpm
       BLS.]


      REAL WAGES RISING AGAIN. After stagnating or declining for years, real wages are rising
       again. Over the past 12 months, wages have risen 3.8 percent -- that's twice as fast as the rate of
       inflation. [Source: BLS]

      UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINED 4.7 PERCENT -- ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 25 YEARS. The
       January unemployment rate was 4.7 -- its lowest level since 1973. The unemployment rate has
       been below 6 for 41 consecutive months and at or below 5 for 10 months now with no signs of
       inflationary pressures. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5 . [Source: BLS.]

      TURNING THE CORNER IN BASIC AMERICAN INDUSTRIES. Under President Clinton,
       basic American industries, such as construction and autos, are coming back and leading the world.

       o       1.3 Million New Construction Jobs. After losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous four
               years, more than 1.3 million new construction jobs have been added since January 1993 -- that's a faster
               annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S Truman was President.

       o       149,000 New Automobile Jobs -- Leading The World Once Again. After losing 35,000 jobs in the auto
               industry during the Bush years, we have 149,000 new auto jobs under President Clinton. For the first
               time since the 1970s, America has led the world in auto production for four years in a row.

       o       612,000 New Manufacturing Jobs. After losing 2.1 million manufacturing jobs during the Reagan-Bush
               years, the economy has created 612,000 new manufacturing jobs under President Clinton.

      SPREADING PROSPERITY TO MORE AMERICANS. Under President Clinton, the
       African-American unemployment rate has fallen from 14.1 percent to 9.3 percent -- its lowest level
       in 25 years. And the Hispanic unemployment rate has dropped from 11.3 percent to 6.9 percent --
