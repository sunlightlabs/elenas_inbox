TEXT:
I talked with Karen Popp today.   I suggested that she and I meet today to
attempt to merge the memos and then have it reviewed by you.   She thought
that would be fine, .but said that you had told her that you wanted to
review my section first.   I said that would be fine by me.  We both think
your review may expedite finalizing the memo.

So, here comes my 4-option pros and cons insert.  I believe it is
consistent with our conversation, but am anxious for your comments.

Thanks Elena.

     1.   Endorse Hyde/Hatch Legislative Alternative, After the Justice Department's legal
          interpretation is released, we could endorse the expected introduction of legislation
          authorizing the DEA to pursue criminal investigations of physicians prescribing
          medications for assisted suicides.

          Pros

                Appears consistent with our stated public position of opposition to assisted
                 suicide.

                Avoids inevitable conflict with the Republican Congress and "right-wing" side of
                 party.

          Cons

                Raises important and potentially extremely problematic precedent for the
                 establishment of a major Federal regulatory role over medical practice, a
                 responsibility that has historically been the province of the states.

                   According to physicians' groups and even the Catholic Health Association, a
                   Federal law in this area will increase the well documented problem of
                   undermedicating terminally ill patients as physicians become even more afraid of
                 . prescribing pain control medications that could make them vulnerable to
                   prosecution by the Federal Government.


     2.   Oppose Hatch/Hyde legislation outright. Concurrent with the expected introduction
          of the Hatch/Hyde bill, communicate to the Hill that, while you find assisted suicide to be
          an abhorrent practice (as illustrated by your enactment of the Anti-Assisted Suicide Act
          of 1997), you cannot support legislation that diverts limited law enforcement resources
          from the DEA for this purpose. Moreover, you would underscore that you believe it
          would be ill-advised to pass a new, precedent-laden Federal bill that was extremely
          intrusive to state oversight over the regulation over the patient/doctor relationship.

          Pros

                Sends a clear signal of opposition, a position that is consistent with that advocated
                 by both HHS and Justice.

                Does not further confuse or frighten doctors, who are already seriously
                 undermedicating terminally ill patients because of their fear of being prosecuted
                 or at least publicly criticized for hastening death inappropriately.
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

               Could avoid a time-consuming and likely unproductive negotiating process with
                the Hill over Federal legislation that is extremely difficult to envision resulting in
                a rationale, desirable policy outcome.

         Cons

               Appears. inconsistent with historic position in opposition to assisted suicide.

               Risks major confrontation with the Republicans and virtually all representatives of
                the "religious right."


    3_   Oppose DEA (likely Hatch/Hyde) approach, but suggest openness to alternatives.
         Welcome the intent of the Republican DEA bill, but raise the same concerns outlined in
         option 2. Advise Republicans that we believe that there may be other ways to implement
         the intent of their legislation in a more workable fashion. In this context, we could
         suggest alternative enforcement agencies (such as FDA) and enforcement mechanisms,
         (such as reducing Federal support for Medicaid for states that are engaged in this
         Euthanasia process). By definition, this process would be designed to seriously attempt
         to find some common ground with the Republicans and the Governors to sincerely
         developing a workable legislative alternative to DEA enforcement.

         Pros

               Seems consistent with your historic "assisted suicide" position.

               Shows we are seriously concerned about this issue; so much so that we are willing
                to help develop legislation that addresses the "rationing" fears that many
                conservative Americans have.

               Would take an enforcement approach that does not tap into limited DEA resources
                or rely on DEA enforcement agents (who might not be sensitized to this most
                sensitive of issues).

         Cons

               May excessively raise expectations that a legislative solution can be achieved
                when, in fact, it may be virtually impossible to reach consensus.

               Relying on a financial enforcement mechanism like reduction of Federal Medicaid
                matching (or something like highway) dollars would be strongly opposed by the
                states as micro-management and as an inappropriate Federal intrusion of states
                rights and responsibilities.

4.   "Kick the Can" Strategy. The last option is to take the same "openness to addressing
     issue" public position on tlle bill tllat was outlined in option 3, but participate in a process
     tllat is explicitly designed to conclude in non-action. Such an approach would presume a
     drawn-out process tllat allows tlle time for tlle medical groups, states, and otllers to
     communicate to all sides tllat Federal approaches in tllis area don't work and are
     ill-advised. At tllevery least, the opponents would raise serious enough objections to
     conclude tllat we do not have time to draft tllOughtful Federal legislation tllis year.


     Pros

            Would allow tlle process and tlle alTected parties be tlle most influential
             participants to achieving closure on tllis controversial issue - not us.

            Would allow us to reiterate our strong position against assisted suicide in a way tllat
             does not result in legislation tllat creates as many or more undesirable precedences
             and problems than it solves.

            Would allow tlle time for all tlle issues on tlils controversial issue to be aired; might
             even help educate physicians and tlle public at large about tlle very real and serious
             under-medication for tenninally ill problem.

     Cons

            Could make us look indecisive and weak.

            Could be viewed \\~tll skepticism on tlle Hill and make us vulnerable to charge tllat
             we are trying to have it bOtll ways.
