TEXT:
Attached is one cut at an education strategy document that will hopefull
get you through Thursday in one piece. In addition, I have marked up a
copy of the charts that you all left me Tuesday night, in case you want to
incorporate a revised version of that for your meeting.

Sorry I won't be able to make it, but just think of this ad FMLA in action.

The latest information I have is that staff in ED were given until COB
Thursday to produce an initial draft strategy for each of the 10 points.
If we have to put this more serious strategy effort on a fast track, I can
try to meet with the ED folks all day on Friday, with the purpose of
turning their drafts into a more finished product by (COB Friday? Monday?
Tuesday?) that we can then either turn in to COS or POTUS if we absolutely
must in order to convince them that there is in fact a stragegy. Better
still, we could use as the focus for the continuing discussions of what
was to have been the regular Monday afternoon education strategy group,
with the objective of completing an agreed-upon comprehensive strategy by
some fixed deadline.

I don't want to drag this out, but I do think it is worth taking the time
to get this right, even if it means we get by for the next few weeks with
our best guess as to what the next 3-5 events for POTUS should be.    To
get a strategy we all think is appropriate and likely to succeed will
require some time to determine what is workable, some good creative
thought to see how the various strategies can best fit together, and some
real attention to what expectations we can mee~ and want to create.   I'm
afraid that anything we through together in the next few days will not
meet this standard, will not muster much enthusiasm from WH and ED folks
who will have been left out of the process, and will last for a short time
while we go back and try again.  So, anything we can do to buy a little
breathing and thinking time would be helpful.

MEMORANDUM FOR BRUCE REED

FROM:                  Mike Cohen

SUBJECT:               Education Strategy

CC:                    Elena Kagan


I understand from Elena that the need for an education strategy may be more urgent than we had
discussed earlier today.

The Education Department draft strategies are due to Leslie Thornton COB Thursday. If
necessary, I can spend the day on Friday working with folks to tum those drafts into something
we can use. I'll touch base with you on that tomorrow.

In the meantime, the attached reflects our conversation earlier today, as well as a conversation
Elena and I had this evening.

The basic strategic approach in the attached document is:

1. Keep the primary focus on the national standards/testing proposal, to get it clear in the public
mind, to build momentum behind it, and to make it more difficult for the opposition on the right
to get a foundation for effective attack.

2. Pay period public attention to related reform agenda, as a way of speaking to different
audiences, keeping those issues alive, and making news that will keep an overall focus on
education

3. Do enough to keep the legislative ball moving forward on issues requiring Congressional
action. (note: this piece needs to be filled in in conjunction with budget strategy and with the
process following up Tuesday's meeting with the Congressional leadership and the Education
Working Group Riley will head up.)

I'll call you in the morning. If you want in to conference in to the AFT meeting, I should be able
to, and I would like to be part of that discussion if possible.
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
