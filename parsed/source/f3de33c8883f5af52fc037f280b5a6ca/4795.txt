                               Immigration Talking Points

Reducing Legal Immigration

Background: Last month, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform released its final report
to Congress and renewed its call to substantially reduce legal immigration levels. More
specifically, it proposed the elimination of the "fourth preference" category which allows
individuals to sponsor their brothers and sisters for immigration. Many Asian-Americans use
the fourth preference category-- which has a significant backlog -- and advocacy groups strongly
oppose its elimination. It is extremely unlikely that Congress will act on the Commission's legal
immigration recommendations this year.

Talking Points
      Last year, Congress considered and failed to reach agreement on cuts to legal
       immigration. At that time, the President indicated that he could support a moderate
       reduction in legal immigration that was consistent with pro-family, pro-work and
       pro-naturalization principles. The Administration continues to believe that any proposal
       to reform legal immigration must advance these principles.

      While it appears unlikely that the Congress will take up major legal immigration reform
       anytime soon, the Administration maintains its position that reforms should address the
       significant backlog of applicants waiting to immigrate under the fourth preference.


Naturalization

      The Administration is working to improve waiting times and provide more efficient
       service to citizenship applicants, while maintaining the highest standards of integrity to
       the naturalization process.

      As you know, we have received unprecedented numbers of naturalization applications--by
       July 31, INS had received over 1.4 million naturalization applications for FY 97-- a 51 %
       increase over the same period in FY 1996.

      The new INS Office of Naturalization Operations was created four and a half months ago
       to strengthen the integrity of the naturalization system and improve customer service.
       The new office has made considerable progress on its plan to fully automate and
       standardize naturalization procedures across the country by the summer of 1998.

      With regard to a naturalization fee increase, INS has conducted a thorough review of their
       application process and may propose a fee increase that reflects the true costs of
       adjudicating these benefits. A fee increase will not be implemented until improvements
       have been made to the naturalization process.

I talked to OMB, and they are going to participate in a meeting with USDA,
FDA, and USTR to work out any potential problems in the legislation.
Jerry is going to attend the meeting tomorrow.  OMB has now slowed down
the process enough to work out any problems. Regards, Mary
