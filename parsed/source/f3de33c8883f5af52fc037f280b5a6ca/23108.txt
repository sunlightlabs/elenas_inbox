TEXT:
Attached, please find information on the White House Millennium Council
Higher Education Conference taking place in the Old Executive Office
Building tomorrow, March 11 from 8:30am-4:30pm.

We will have 75 college presidents, provosts, and deans at this conference
to discuss how to share their arts and humanities faculty with their
surrounding communities.  We have partnered with the University of
Michigan on this millennium project which is entitled "Imagining America:
Artists and Scholars in Public Life." The idea is to overcome traditional
"town-gown" separations, and to promote the notion of faculty as community
resources.

I have attached an agenda, participants list and 1 page outline of this
project and conference.  Please feel free to call me or Josefina Velasco
on my staff at x57109 if you have any questions or would like additional
information.

    WHITE HOUSE MILLENNIUM COUNCIL HIGHER EDUCATION INITIATIVE
             "Imagining America: Artists and Scholars in Public Life"
                                  (1999-2004)     .

Program Description:

"Imagining America: Artists and Scholars in Public Life" is a millennium higher education
initiative to support and celebrate the ways in which university artists and humanists do
important civic work by placing arts and humanities faculty members in community settings
where they work closely with citizens on arts projects and inquiries using the disciplines of the
humanities.

Activities under this initiative have been organized into three program areas:

      project grants for university-public partnerships;
      programs involving the design and planning of places; and,
      major artist residencies aimed at making and producing new work about the shared world
       of the university and the region.

National conferences, grants and communications components will also be developed.

Partners:

The White House Millennium Council
The National Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Foundation
University of Michigan (and a consortium of colleges and universities, chaired by University of
Michigan President Lee C. Bollinger)

Administration of the initiative will housed at the University of Michigan and coordinated
through the Office of the Vice President for Research.

Audience:

Public schools
Local governments
Public institutions (such as libraries and museums)
Cultural organizations

These may include the following participants: undergraduates, K-12 teachers and students,
cultural leaders in communities and regions, and other citizens engaged by public art and public
humanities programs.
                                                 liex-Dilmp Corjrgmipn .
Initial Funding:

      Individual colleges and universities: University presidents are being asked to commit
       funds to support projects on each of their campuses. Thirty colleges and universities
       have already pledge support and resources for projects at their individual institutions.

      The Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Foundation has agreed to administer a competitive
       national grant program for partnerships between a university or a college-based artist or
       humanist and a co-investigator who will be a teacher, artist, or community leader.

      Other sources of funding will be sought to expand the number of projects that can be
       funded at a national level.

Imagining America Conference - Washington, DC
Thursday, March 11, 1999
8:00-3:30pm
Room 450, Old Executive Office Building
The purpose of the conference is to enlist the attending institutions in creating their own
"Imagining America" millennium projects. Participants of the conference will include:

      University presidents
      Federal agencies
      Foundations
      Individual scholars and artists
Lee Bollinger, President of the University of Michigan, Robert Weisbuch, President of the
Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation and Ellen McCulloch-Lovell, Director of the
White House Millennium Council will co-chair the conference. For more information on the
initiative and conference, the University of Michigan has set up the following webpage:

Background:
In 1997-98, The University of Michigan sponsored YoHA -- the Year of Humanities and Arts, a
catalytic endeavor involving several experimental programs. One of the most successful pilot
programs is called "The Arts of Citizenship." This program fulfills one of the fundamental
goals of YoHA: to focus on the relationship between culture and place by bringing the
University's many constituencies, including neighboring communities, into significant contact
with one another. In April 1998, Mrs. Clinton gave a speech at the University of Michigan as
the culminating event ofYoHA. Ellen McCulloch-Lovell, Director of the White House
Millennium Council, accompanied Mrs. Clinton on the occasion of this speech. Lee C. Bollinger,
Nancy E. Cantor and Robert Weisbuch invited Mrs. McCulloch-Lovell to talk about how the
spirit and goals of the YoHA Arts of Citizenship Program could be expanded into a national
higher-education initiative linked to the White House Millennium Program. The culmination of
this conversation and many that followed is the "Imagining America: Artists'and Scholars in
Public Life" Initiative.
