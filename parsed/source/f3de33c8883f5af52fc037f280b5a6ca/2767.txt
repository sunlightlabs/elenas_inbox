 TEXT:
 1. you edited welfare to work section to say "cities and local
 governments with large numbers of poor people." since governments don't
 have poor people, we edited it to say "cities and other communities with
 large numbers of poor people."

 2.   We added to the legal immigrant Q&A a quote from a joint letter from
 the aging and disability umbrella groups that really helps our case.  They
 are saying they won't support benefits reductions to disabled immigrants
 in order to give them to other groups.  it's a good letter.  (it says they
 think elderly should get restored through additional funds, but the first
 priority is to do at a minimum what the budget agreement says.)

 3. I misled you to think that we are better than Shaw by 75,000 legal
 immigrants by the year 2000; it's really 2002.

 4. OMB made me add "approximately" to statement that 2/3 of the elderly
 could be reclassified from aged to disabled.

 Page me if there is anything wrong with these changes, because I'm walking
 them around now.

      The Administration strongly opposes the House Ways and Means Subcommittee
       proposal, which violates the bipartisan budget agreement, treats disabled legal immigrants
       unfairly, and prevents working welfare recipients from getting a minimum wage.

      The Administration is pleased that the Ways and Means Subcommittee $3 billion
       welfare-to-work proposal meets many of the Administration's priorities. These include:
       targeting funds to areas and individuals with high needs, directing funds to cities and
       local governments, awarding some funds competitively, and allowing communities to
       create successful job placement and creation programs.

      But the provisions of the Subcommittee proposal addressing legal immigrants and the
       minimum wage are clearly unacceptable.

Legal Immigrants
      The Ways and Means Subcommittee's proposed amendment to the welfare law clearly
       violates the negotiated, bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a minimal safety net
       for disabled legal immigrants. The Subcommittee's proposal would restore SSI and
       Medicaid benefits only to immigrants already receiving benefits prior to August 23,
       1996; by contrast, the bipartisan budget agreement policy restores SSI and Medicaid
       benefits to any immigrant in the country as of that date who is or becomes disabled.

      The Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal would protect 75,000 fewer immigrants
       than the budget agreement by the year 2002. And in leaving unprotected any person who
       becomes disabled after August 22, 1996, it fails to target assistance to the most vulnerable
       individuals.

Minimum Wage
    The Administration also strongly opposes the Ways and Means Subcommittee's
     provision on the minimum wage, which undermines the fundamental goals of welfare
     reform.

      The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work must work -- and that
       those who work should earn the minimum wage, whether they are coming off of welfare
       or not.

      The House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal does not meet this test. It
       effectively creates a subminimum wage for workfare participants. And it weakens the
       welfare law's work requirements.

                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

The Ways and Means Subcommittee's proposed amendment to the welfare law clearly violates
the negotiated, bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a minimal safety net for disabled
legal immigrants. The Subcommittee's proposal would restore SSI and Medicaid benefits only
to immigrants (both the disabled and non-disabled elderly) already receiving benefits prior to
August 23, 1996; by contrast, the bipartisan budget agreement policy restores SSI and Medicaid
benefits to any immigrant in the country as of that date who is or becomes disabled. The budget
agreement targets assistance to the most vulnerable individuals.

      THE WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL IGNORES
       VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS WHO BECOME DISABLED AFTER AUGUST
       22,1996: This proposal abandons many legal immigrants who were in the U.S. when
       the welfare law was signed but become severely disabled after that date. In contrast, the
       bipartisan budget agreement protects these immigrants.

      BY THE YEAR 2002, THE WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL
       WOULD PROTECT 75,000 FEWER IMMIGRANTS THAN THE BUDGET
       AGREEMENT. This number grows to 125,000 by the year 2007.

       Example: A legal immigrant family entered the country 3 years ago. Both the father and
       mother have worked full-time since then, and have an annual income of about $25,000,
       but neither job provides health insurance for themselves or the family. Their 5 year-old
       son becomes severely disabled in a car accident next year. Under the budget agreement,
       he would be eligible for SSI and Medicaid; under the Ways and Means Subcommittee's
       proposal he would be denied SSI -- and potentially denied Medicaid.

Question:     Doesn't the Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal treat the elderly better than
              the Administration's proposal, while the Administration's policy favors the
              disabled? Isn't this really a wash?

Answer:       The parties to the budget agreement already made the decision about where to
              target limited resources. The agreement explicitly states the policy of restoring
              SSI and Medicaid eligibility to immigrants who are or become disabled and who
              are in the U.S. as of August 22,1996. This is one of the specific policies agreed
              to by the President and the Congressional leadership. Furthermore, the
              Leadership Council of Aging Organizations and the Consortium of Citizens with
              Disabilities state that they will not support "any reductions in benefits to
              immigrants with disabilities in order to provide them to other groups of
              immigrants. "

              The Administration believes that the budget agreement appropriately targets the
              most vulnerable individuals. It provides for all immigrants in the country when
              the welfare law was signed who have suffered -- or may suffer in the future -- a
              disabling accident or illness. At the same time, the agreement will result in
              restoring benefits to a full 80% of the caseload as of August 22, 1996 -- all of
              those now classified as disabled plus approximately two-thirds of the elderly
              caseload who can be reclassified as disabled.

We are pleased that the Ways and Means subcommittee has included in its mark a $3 billion
welfare-to-work proposal that meets many of the Administration's priorities:

      It directs funds where they're needed most: to help long term recipients in cities and
       other communities with large numbers of poor people;
      It awards some funds on a competitive basis, assuring the best use of scarce resources;
      It provides communities with appropriate flexibility to use the funds to create successful
       job placement and creation programs.

We are pleased that Congressman Shaw was willing to work in a bipartisan basis to incorporate
many of the Administration's priorities.

We are, however, deeply disappointed at the subcommittee draft's lack of adequate worker
protections and non-displacement provisions, and urge the subcommittee to add language that
will better protect against worker displacement.

The President proposed a $3 billion welfare to work program last fall and fought to have it
included in the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. A centerpiece of the President's
second-term agenda, the proposal will help move one million adults from welfare to work by the
year 2000.


                               MINIMUM WAGE AND WORKFARE

    Background: The Labor Department has concluded that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
    applies to welfare recipients in workfare or other subsidized employment programs in the same
    way as that law applies to all other employees. This means that most welfare recipients in these
    programs will receive at least the minimum wage.

    The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources proposes to amend the welfare
    law so that welfare recipients engaged in workfare would not be employees for the purposes of
    the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other federal law. Although requiring the minimum wage
    for hours worked, the proposal would permit states to count child care, Medicaid, and housing
    benefits in their calculation of the minimum wage. It would also allow states to count additional
    hours of job search, education, and training toward the welfare law's work requirements.

    The Administration strongly opposes the Ways and Means Subcommittee's provision on
    the minimum wage and welfare work requirements.

          This Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal would undermine the fundamental goals
           of welfare reform. The Administration believes strongly that everyone who can work
           must work -- and that those who work should earn the minimum wage, whether they are
           coming off of welfare or not.

          The House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal does not meet this test. It
           effectively creates a subminimum wage for workfare participants. And it weakens the
           welfare law's work requirements.

          This Subcommittee proposal also was not addressed in the budget agreement between the
           White House and Congress and should therefore not be included in the reconciliation bill.
