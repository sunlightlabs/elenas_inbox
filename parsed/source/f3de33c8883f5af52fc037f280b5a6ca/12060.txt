                             TRANSITION TO TEACHING


SEC. XXX. Title II of the Act is further amended by adding a new subpart 1 of Part B to

read as follows:

                    "SUBPART 1 -- TRANSITION TO TEACHING

                                       "FINDINGS

       "SEC. 2201. The Congress finds as follows:

               "(1) School districts will need to hire more than 2 million teachers in the

next decade. The need for teachers in the areas of math, science, foreign languages,

special education, and bilingual education, and for those able to teach in poverty school

districts will be particularly high. To meet this need, talented Americans of all ages

should be recruited to become successful, qualified teachers.

               "(2) Nearly 28 percent ofteachers of academic subjects have neither an

undergraduate major nor minor in their main assignment fields .. This problem is more

acute in high-poverty schools, where the out-of-field percentage is 39 percent.

               "(3) Out-of-field teaching is greatest in math and science, with 26 percent

of students in high-poverty public secondary schools being taught math by a teacher with

neither a major nor a minor in the field, and 71 percent of such students being taught

physics by such a teacher.

               "(4) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) ranked

U.S. high school seniors last among 16 countries in physics and next to last in math. It is

also evident, mainly from the TIMSS data, that based on academic scores, a stronger
                                                                                      Flex-Dump Conversion


emphasis needs to be placed on the academic preparation of our children in math and

science.

               "(5) One-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very difficult to fill

bilingual teaching positions, and nearly half of public school teachers have students in

their classrooms for whom English is a second language.

               "(6) Many career-changing professionals with strong content-area skills

are interested in a teaching career, but need assistance in getting the appropriate

pedagogical training and classroom experience.

               "(7) The Troops to Teachers model has been highly successful in linking

high-quality teachers to teach in low-performing, high-poverty schools districts.



                                        "PURPOSE

       "SEC. 2202. The purpose of this subpart is to address the need of high-poverty

school districts for highly qualified teachers in particular subject areas, such as

mathematics, science, foreign languages, bilingual education, and special education, in

high-poverty school districts by-

               "(1) continuing and expanding the Troops to Teachers model for

recruiting, preparing, placing, and supporting such teachers; and

               "(2) recruiting, preparing, placing, and supporting career-changing

professionals who have knowledge and experience that will help them become such

teachers.

                               "(B) Upon agreement, transfer that amount to the Defense

Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) to carry out the Troops to

Teachers program, consistent with the requirements of this sUbpart.

                       "(2) The Secretary may enter into a written agreement with the

Departments of Defense and Transportation, or take such other steps as the Secretary

detennines are appropriate to ensure effective continuation of the Troops to Teachers

program.

                       Section-by-Section Analysis
                      TITLE II--PART B-Subpart 1

       Section XXX. Section XXX of the bill would amend Title II ofthe Act by adding
a new subpart 1 of Part B, authorizing the Transition to Teaching Program.

         Proposed new section 2201 of the Act would set out the Congressional findings
for the new subpart. In the next decade, school districts will need to hire more than 2
million teachers, especially in the areas of math, science, foreign languages, special
education, and bilingual education. The need for teachers able to teach in poverty school
districts will be particularly high. To meet this need, talented Americans of all ages
should be recruited to become successful, qualified teachers.

        Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have neither a major nor a
minor in their main assignment fields. This problem is even more acute in high-poverty
areas, where the out-of-field percentage is 39. Out-of-field teaching is greatest in math
and science, with 26 percent of students in high-poverty public secondary schools being
taught math, and 71 percent of such students being taught physics, by a teacher with
neither a major nor minor in the field.

       Additionally, the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) ranked
U.S. high school seniors last among 16 countries in physics, and next to last in math.
Based mainly on TIMSS data, it is also evident that a stronger emphasis needs to be
placed on the academic preparation of our children in math and science.

       Further, one-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very difficult to fill bilingual
teaching positions, and nearly half of public school teachers have students in their
classrooms for whom English is a second language.

       Many career-changing professionals with strong content-area skills are interested
in making a transition to a teaching career, but need assistance in getting the appropriate
pedagogical training and classroom experience. The Troops to Teachers model has been
highly successful in linking high-quality teachers to teach in low-performing, high-
poverty school districts.

        Proposed new section 2202 ofthe Act would establish the statement of purpose
for the program. Under proposed new section 2202, the purpose of the program would be
to address the shortage of highly qualified teachers in subject areas such as mathematics,
science, foreign languages, bilingual education, and special education, in high-poverty
school districts. This would be accomplished by continuing and expanding the Troops to
Teachers model for recruiting, preparing, placing, and supporting such teachers, and by
recruiting, preparing, placing, and supporting career-changing professionals who have
knowledge and experience that would help them become such teachers.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

        Proposed new section 2203 of the Act would establish the program authority and
the authorization of appropriations for the Transition to Teaching program. Under
proposed new section 2203(a), the Secretary would be authorized to use funds
appropriated under proposed new section 2203(c) for each fiscal year to award grants,
contracts, or cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education and public and
private nonprofit agencies or organizations to carry out programs authorized by this
subpart.

       Proposed new section 2203(b)(1)(A) would provide that before making any
awards under proposed new section 2203(a), the Secretary would be required to consult
with the Secretaries of Defense and Transportation with respect to the appropriate amount
of funding necessary to continue and enhance the Troops for Teachers program.
Additionally, proposed new section 2203(b)(1)(B) would provide that upon agreement,
the Secretary transfer the amount under proposed new section 2203(b)(B) to the Defense
Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) to carry out the Troops for
Teachers program, consistent with the requirements of this subpart. Further, proposed
new section 2203(b )(2) would allow the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the
Departments of Defense and Transportation, or take such steps as the Secretary
determines are appropriate to ensure effective continuation of the Troops to Teachers
program.

        Finally, proposed new section 2203(c) would authorize the appropriation of such
sums for fiscal year 2001 and each of the four succeeding fiscal years to carry out this
subpart.

         Proposed new section 2204 of the Act would establish the application process
requirements. Proposed new section 2204 would provide that an applIcant that desires a
grant under this chapter must submit to the Secretary an application containing such

2204, applicants would be required to include a description of the target group of career-
changing professionals upon which they would focus in carrying out their programs
under this subpart, including a description of the characteristics of that target group that
shows how the knowledge and experience of its members is relevant to meeting the
purpose of this subpart. Under paragraphs (2) and (3) of proposed new section 2204, an
applicant would also be required to describe how it plans to identify and recruit program
participants, as well as what type of training program participants would receive and how
that training would relate to their certification as teachers.

         Paragraph (4) of proposed new section 2204 would require an applicant to
describe how it would ensure that program participants were placed and would teach in
high-need local educational agencies (LEAs). Paragraph (5) would require a description
of the teacher induction services program participants would receive throughout at least
their first year of teaching. Paragraph (6) of proposed new section 2204 would require an
applicant to describe how the applicant would collaborate, as needed, with other
institutions, agencies, or organizations to recruit, train, place, and support program

participants under this part, including evidence ofthe commitment of the institutions,
agencies, or org·anizations to the applicant's program.

        Paragraph (7) of proposed new section 2204 would require a description of how
the applicant would evaluate the progress and effectiveness of its program, including the
program's goals and objectives, the performance indicators the applicant would use to

the program's effectiveness. Finally, paragraph (8) of proposed new section 2204 would
require an assurance that the applicant would provide to the Secretary such information
as the Secretary determines necessary to assess the overall effectiveness of programs
under this subpart.

        Proposed new section 2205 would describe the activities authorized under this
subpart. Under proposed new section 2205( a)(l), funds received under this subpart could
be used to recruit program participants. The recruitment could include informing
program participants of opportunities under the program, and putting them in contact
with other institutions, agencies, or organizations that would train, place, and support
them. Proposed new section 2205(a)(2) would authorize training stipends and other
financial incentives for program participants. This could include moving expenses, not to
exceed $5,000, in the aggregate, per participant.

        Proposed new section 2205(a)(3) would authorize the use of funds under this
subpart to assist institutions of higher education or other providers of teacher training to
meet the particular needs of professionals who are changing their careers to teaching.
Proposed new section 2205(a)(4) would authorize placement activities, including
identifying high-need LEAs with needs for particular skills and characteristics of the
newly trained program participants and assisting those participants to obtain employment
in those LEAs. Proposed new section 2205(a)(5) would authorize post-placement
induction or support activities for program participants.

         Proposed new section 2205(b) would establish the period of service. Under
proposed new section 2205(b), a program participant who completes his or her training
would be required to teach in a high-need LEA for at least four years. Proposed new
section 2205(c) would allow the Secretary to establish appropriate requirements to ensure
that program participants who receive a training stipend or other financial incentive but
fail to complete their service obligation repay all or a portion of such stipend or other
incentive.

        Proposed new section 2206 would require the Secretary, to the extent practicable,
to make awards under this subpart that support programs in different geographic regions
of the nation.

       Finally, proposed new section 2207 would establish definitions for the program.
Proposed new section 2207(1) would define the term "high-need local educational
agency" as an LEA that serves an elementary or secondary school located in an area in
which there is, as determined by the Secretary, a high percentage of students from

families with incomes below the poverty line, a high percentage of secondary school
teachers not teaching in the content area in which they were trained; or a high teacher
turnover rate. Proposed new section 2207(2) would define the term "program
participants" as career-changing professionals, including returning or separating military
personnel, who hold at least a baccalaureate degree, demonstrate interest in, and
commitment to becoming a teacher, and have knowledge and experience relevant to
