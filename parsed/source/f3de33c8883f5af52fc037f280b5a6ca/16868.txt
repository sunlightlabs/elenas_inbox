     TEXT:
     Here is my chart, redone to show what I believe the results of yesterday's
     meeting were. As you can see, there's really only one outstanding major
     issue (they came very close to saying they'd narrow the small business cap
     significantly if we agreed to no two-way preemption on punitives; I think
     they will if that's the last outstanding issue). We need to figure out
     what we do next.   They strongly believe Lott wants to make certain the
     Senate brings this bill to the floor before the House does, and the House
     wants to do it in mid-October.   Any time in the next several weeks, after
     the DC, HHS and Interior appropriations bills are done, is likely.    (If
     there is agreement between us and Rockefeller, Rockefeller will work with
     Gorton to make certain the revised bill is procedurally unamendable.)     So
     they are strongly urging a swift reaction from the President, communicated
     directly to the Senator. Senator Rockefeller joined the meeting briefly
     to remind us that he had acted in good faith, and assumed the President
     would too.  ellen==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

                        punitives as a purpose inappropriate; bill

                        may be inappropriate as there's no
                        several liability provision anymore; on
                        the other hand, there is in effect an

                        the definition of compensatory damages,
                        to include both. It's probably better to
                        delete the separate definitions of
                        economic and non-economic damages to

20      3-7          question whether "reasonably                Did not discuss

                     defendant's responsibility

                     not; have to think about how toxic torts
                     are dealt with)

22      5-6          is workers comp requirement ("that is       We internally agreed this
                     covered") sufficient (statute of repose),   was OK
                     or does there need to be another
                     requirement relating to payment under
                     workers comp?

22      9-19         interaction of limitations and repose       Agree it's a problem; have
                     doesn't seem to work (see also p.23, 11     asked us to fix it; believe
                     16-24); given that only durable goods       toxics exception is covered
                     are now covered, do we need an              in durable good def, but
                     extension for latent effects, toxic harm?   agree it should exist

24-25   all of sec   this doesn't seem to accomplish the goal    Did not discuss

                     subsection (a), reference to such a period
                     in subsection (b) doesn't work; without
                     some sort of judicial oversight, does this
                     unfairly press plaintiffs to accept
                     too-low offers {see, e.g., the situation

                     appropriate standard? (FA - no; we
                     wanted "conscious indifference (not
                     including recklessness)"; in particular
                     we wanted to get rid of "flagrant")
