MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:               EdleyMemo


        Chris's attached memo stresses two areas in economic opportunity and development
where he feels our efforts so far are inadequate. While we will agree that if we had unlimited
resources it would be good to do even more and while there are legitimate differences on how
best to tackle these challenges, it is important to put his ideas in both areas in perspective.

Economic Development:

         On top of your Empowerment Zones, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Community
Development Financial Institution (CDFI) fund, you will announce on Friday the New Markets
Initiative, which will dramatically expand capital investments in our underserved areas. This
initiative will include:

       A New Market Investment Tax Credit: You will propose a new $1 billion tax credit,
        which will be available for qualified equity investments in a range of vehicles financing
        businesses in America's new markets. An investor will receive total tax credits up to a
        fixed percentage ofhislher investment. This tax credit will leverage $6 billion in
        additional investment in our distressed communities.

       The Creation of America's Private Investment Companies (API C): In response to
        concerns that the SBICs are too limited in size to meet the need for larger-scale
        investment in underserved areas, you will propose a new program to provide government
        guarantees for investment partnerships targeting larger businesses relocating or expanding
        in inner cities and rural areas. This initiative will allow government guarantees on debt
        up to two times the amount of equity investment allowing up to five investment firms
        each with up to $300 million to invest -- or up to $1.5 billion in investment.

       New Markets Venture Capital Firms (NMVC): To help small-sized firms in
        underserved areas that need investment and technical assistance, you will propose that
        SBA finance investment firms offering a new combination of investment and technical
        assistance to smaller businesses in targeted areas. The program should provide long-term,
        patient growth capital and facilitate critically needed technology and management skills
        development for these firms.
       SBIC Targeting for Underserved Areas: In order to meet better the needs of minority
        firms and underserved markets, SBA will hold a series of workshops throughout the

                                                1
                                                                                 Hcx-Cump COnVG,SiOn


       country to educate the business and investment community about the SBIC program and
       to promote the formation of SBICs focused on equity capital for underserved areas. SBA
       will also provide a new financing mechanism and more favorable regulatory treatment, if
       an SBIC invests in businesses in underserved areas (or which draw a significant
       proportion of its employees from those areas).

      250 Percent Expansion of Microenterprise Investment: In many underserved areas,
       fostering opportunities for the smallest of entrepreneurs can help to build the job base and
       provide economic stability to a community. Your budget calls for a 250-percent increase
       in funding for technical assistance and lending to very small businesses.

         Chris recommends re-chartering the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBS) to create
a National Community Investment Bank with the goal of promoting community development.
While we share Chris's interest in the potential ofGSEs doing more to meet public policy
objectives, the issues involving Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLBS are complex and
delicate. In the end, we believe that our chances are far greater to get a sound New Markets
Initiative passed by this Congress than a prudent new GSE.

       However, the complexity and unlikelihood that Chris's proposal will pass Congress in a
sensible form are not sufficient enough reasons to exclude it from a visionary statement. You
should know, though, that experts within your Administration have significant problems with the
proposal on substance grounds.

        For example, there is much skepticism that political dynamics will allow us to add new
public purpose obligations on the FHLBS -- the off-budget subsidies of which Chris writes -- and
reduce arbitrage significantly at the same time. More likely, some fear, the mission will be
expanded and the leakage offederal subsidy to private hands will grow. Treasury has thus far
insisted that these "abuses" be stemmed before any -- even modest -- mission expansion can go
forward.

       If you would like to pursue this idea further, we can convene a process to evaluate this
option and develop a pro/con memo to inform your decision on how to proceed.

Youth Jobs:

        We share Chris's goal of "breaking the back of endemic hyper-unemployment in
distressed communities." However, we must respectfully disagree with Chris's belief that your
Youth Opportunities Initiative is not a good answer because it is too concentrated in a few areas
and will serve "only" 60,000 poor children this year.

        The overwhelming weight of the academic research shows that in order to truly help
out-of-school youth we need to saturate small areas with a lot of resources so that we change the
culture of joblessness and high unemployment. This is precisely what the Youth Opportunity


                                                2
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conv;;rsion

Initiative will do. It is important to note that serving 60,000 out-of-school youth nationwide is
not a "drop in the swimming pool." For example, last year, there were 280,000 unemployed
African-American teenagers. Therefore, we are taking an significant first step toward
addressing the problem.

        Finally, it is important to note that Youth Opportunities Areas was only one piece of your
agenda to help politically powerless disadvantaged youth. Besides the $250 million in last
year's budget for the new Youth Opportunity Areas, you won $120 million for GEAR-UP -- a
program based on solid research on mentoring programs -- and $70 million more to help
minorities prepare for college and stay in college through the TRIO program. In sum, you won
$510 million more in FY99 than in FY98 -- an enormous one-year increase for investments in
poor children.                                                                     .

       If you include the doubling of GEAR-UP, a new $50 million regional youth initiative, the
new $100 million Right-Track partnership, and the expansion of existing programs in your
FY2000 budget, our investments in programs specifically targeted at poor children will be $902
million higher than in 1998. (See attached table) In the face of a partisan Republican
Congress, this is quite significant progress and will certainly purchase more than "a wrench and
two screws."
