Subject:       Strategy for Maintaining and Expanding Diversity in Higher Education

Over the past 24 hours we have consulted with Department of Education and NEC staff, and
have reached out to the higher education community, to determine what additional steps (beyond
the proposed mentoring and partnerships initiative) the Administration should take to maintain
and expand diversity in the nation's postsecondary institutions. In the course of these
consultations we have identified additional persons with whom further discussions would be
valuable, and who could help us further shape and refine this strategy. For now, here is our
thinking:

I. Make the case for diversity.

       Particularly in the context of higher education, the President should speak even more
        frequently and with greater focus than he does now on the importance of diversity. We
        should consider devoting a town hall to this topic. Pushing this message will greatly
        help higher education institutions sustain their individual efforts.

       Ask the Department of Education to asemble data to more convincingly make the case for
        the educational value of diversity. The higher ed community remains firmly committed
        to the importance of diversity, but they could use help bolstering gut instincts with
        research.

       ACE is organizing an effort to get the entire higher education community to sign on to a
        joint statement on the importance of diversity. A Presidential announcement of such a
        statement could make a strong event.

II. Identify and highlight effective outreach and recruitment efforts.

       Clearly there are some good examples of outreach and recruitment efforts that are
        working in specific circumstances. We should identify and highlight these examples in
        speeches and other forums.

       The Department of Education should be tasked with working with the higher education
        community to determine what publications, guidebooks, or meetings (beyond
        already-scheduled higher education group meetings) could be helpful in this regard.
       discuss successful initiatives.
III. Keep the focus off admissions policies per se.

      Many postsecondary institutions (other than those in the 5th Circuit, or in California,
       which face different constraints) are quietly reviewing their affirmative action poliCies to
       ensure that they pass muster under Bakke. Our sense is that they can best accomplish
       this without high profile attention at the Federal level.
