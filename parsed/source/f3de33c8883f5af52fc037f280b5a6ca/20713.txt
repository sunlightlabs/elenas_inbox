USDA to talk rural agenda.   Either of you might want to go.  Here is
Kaplan's first cut on a memo.   I suggested we add rural housing, food
safety, rural welfare to work,   highway funds, and 2 possible new

Five and A Half Years of Progress. For five and a half years, President Clinton and Vice
President Gore have worked to expand opportunity for rural Americans and farm families. We
have strengthened crop insurance, provided critical disaster assistance to ranchers who have lost
livestock, doubled our use of export credits from last year, improved our school lunch programs by
buying surplus commodities, and worked to diversify the sources of enterprise and income in rural
America. [EXPAND TO INCLUDE RURAL, NOT JUST AG]

But rural America still faces challenges -- with the economic crisis in Asia weakening some of our
best customers for farm products, with strong world crop production bringing prices down, and with
farmers facing floods and fires and drought and crop disease.

A TEN-POINT ACTION PLAN FOR RURAL AMERICA

1. Implementing the Wheat Purchase Initiative. On Saturday, President Clinton acted within his
full authority as President to take immediate steps to help our family farmers and to reduce crop
surpluses at home. This week, the United States government will begin to purchase more than 80
million bushels of wheat, which could lift prices as much as 13 cents a bushel. With this wheat, the
President has instructed Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman to launch a new food aid initiative
to press the world struggle against hunger.

Secretary Glickman, working with our Agency for International Development, will use the authority
granted to him by Congress to oversee substantial donations of U.S. wheat to countries where the
need is greatest -- places such as Sudan and Indonesia. Donations will also be made to private
humanitarian groups. It is good for American farmers, good for our economy and it's the right
thing to do.

2. Exempting Food Exports from        u.s. Sanctions Policy. President Clinton recently stated
support for legislation that would exempt Federal government financing of US food exports from
economic sanctions required by the nuclear non-proliferation law. This was in response to the
harmful potential effect to overseas consumers and US farmers of wheat from the sanctions on
Pakistan, the market for 7 percent of US wheat. But more congressional action must follow. We
should expand eligibility for direct and guaranteed loans, extend marketing loans when crop prices
are low or transportation problems make marketing difficult, give farmers more flexibility to plant
other crops when their primary crops fail. And above all, we must keep the market for our products
growing by paying our dues to the International Monetary Fund so that we can stabilize and help to
reform Asian economies that are such important customers for America's farmers, and for our other
exporters who are responsible for 30 percent of the remarkable growth we've enjoyed since 1993.

3. Promoting an Aggressive Regional Approach to Free Trade. The Clinton Administration has
put in place a comprehensive approach to opening agricultural markets in each of our key export
markets. NAFTA opened Mexico and Canada to U.S. exports; now, exports are up _ percent
[CK]. We have established an agricultural negotiating group in the FTAA talks and important
discussions on specific agricultural products in APEC. And for the first time ever under the

Europe on a range of issues, including approval of genetically modified organisms.

4. Enforcing Our Trade Agreements. This administration has brought and won a number of
important agricultural disputes, including the European Union's restrictions on hormone grown
beef, bananas and pork in the Phillippines. We have been aggressive in using every tool at our
disposal to ensure that agreements made are agreements kept.

5. Protecting Universal Service. [KALIL TO ADD] President Clinton has set a goal of
connecting all rural clinics and hospitals to the "information superhighway." In 1996, he signed the
Telecommunications Act, which expanded the definition of universal service to include rural health
care providers (hospitals, clinics, community health care centers, local health departments, and
medical schools). These institutions are now applying for universal service support, which will be
available starting January 1, 1998. The program (administered by an independent corporation
established by the FCC) is designed to ensure that rural health care providers pay no more than their
urban counterparts for telecommunication services. This will help improve the quality of care in
rural America by allowing patients to receive advice from the best specialists in the country.

6. Carrying Over EEP Balances. The Administration will soon propose legislation to "sweep"
unused balances in USDA's Export Enhancement Program (EEP) int9 other programs such as
PL480 Title I in the last quarter of a fiscal year. This will enable unnecessary and distorting
subsidies for commercial exports to fund additional sales of US crops. The Administration's FY
1999 Budget already proposes that unused balances be carried over into subsequent years to expand
U.S. exports.

7. Improving Education in Risk Management for Farmers. Farmers' ability to manage risk
remains low. Relatively few producers forward contract their crops, though futures markets
originated as a way for farmers to avoid risk. USDA needs to improve its education and outreach
in risk management, perhaps linked with the long-distance learning initiative. More funding could
be made available for pilot options programs, including a new initiative for dairy producers.

8. Establishing a Fundfor Rural America. If we're calling for funding for the Fund for Rural
America, we should also call for letting the funding go forward for the $120 m. in annual ag
research provided in the Ag Research bill the President signed a couple weeks ago. This would
echo the President's comments at the signing, and reinforce the message that we think research has a
vital role in moving ag forward into the 21st century. [???/ChaUenge Congress to moveforwardJ

9. Crop Insurance/Adjustment Assistance. The economic risk being faced in some rural regions,
such as North Dakota, reveals shortcomings of the current Federal crop insurance regime. The
problem is less crop price than crop yield, and an actuarially-sound insurance program must raise
premiums and lower coverage in response to multi-year disease or weather problems. Without
abandoning Administration policy by reinstating permanent crop disaster authority (a controversial,
unnecessary step), the Administration could propose: (1) a program of short-term (5 years)
retirement of formerly-productive farmland now beset with physical problems such as excess
moisture; (2) indemnity payments for losses due to disease, perhaps through crop insurance
subsidies in an auxiliary program. These payments might be designed as adjustment assistance, to

    enable producers in marginal agricultural regions to re-educate or retool. [????IChallenge House
    to move forward}

    10. Whole Farm Insurance. USDA is exploring the feasibility ofa Whole Farm Coverage
    Insurance Program, based on the farmer's income tax information. The appeal of such a product is
    that producers could insure their whole farm, not just individual crops as under the current program.
     Whole farm insurance could also potentially address the problem of insuring minor crops and
    livestock. However, there are a number of rating issues that need to be addressed and USDA lacks
    legal authority to insure livestock under permanent programs. USDA hopes to pilot a program in
    1999.

    11. Pushing for Rural School Modernization. Almost one-half of the nation's 80,000 public
    elementary and secondary schools are located in rural or small town areas. According to the U.S.
    General Accounting Office, 30 percent of those rural and small town schools (educating 4.5 million
    children) have at least one building in need of extensive repair or replacement. We must move
    forward this year with a comprehensive effort to address the needs of rural schoolchildren.

    12. Building a Digital Library for Rural America. The goal ofthis initiative is to dramatically
    increase the quantity, quality and accessibility of networked information related to agriculture and
    rural development by leveraging USDA's existing investment in research and education at our
    nation's land-grant colleges. [Distance Learning??]

    13. Advancing Telemedicine. USDA is committed to making advanced telecommunications
    services such as the Internet available to more rural families. From 1992 to 1996, USDA more than
    doubled the amount ofloans for advanced telecommunication facilities. Last year, it loaned $380
    million for 79 rural telecommunications projects providing service to 211,000 rural households and
    businesses. Provided almost $17 million in loans and grants for distance learning and telemedicine
    projects in 1997 to expand educational and medical opportunities to America's rural communities.
    Since 1993, the DLT program has funded 192 projects in 41 states.

    14. Promoting Economic Development in Rural America. The Clinton Administration, working
    with Congress, has invested more than $175 million in the nation's three rural empowerment zones
    and 33 rural enterprise communities (EZ/ECs) since 1995, creating or saving over 7,000 jobs. And
    more than 700,000 rural citizens now receive additional services in the EZ/EC's as a result of
    USDA loans, grants, and programs. [ADD ruralloans/access to capital; Mary Smith checking
