 TEXT:
  This is the latest draft of the OMB introduction to the civil rights
 package. The package states its four components are compliance, ADR,
 information and data improvements across the lead agencies. The package
 is now a $56 million increase -- a 13.2% increase over the FY 199B enacted
 level (a 10.6% real increase).

         The major specific intitiatives are still the improvements at EEOC
 (6 month goal, more ADR), HUD audit enforcement (a $14 million project),
 and compliance at OFFCP.

         Raines is slated to sit down with OMB staff   Wednesday of next
 week to review this.

         I've asked for and received from the agencies more project ideas
 in the areas of compliance, mediation, data collection, and technology
 they would make. As of today, I have new projects in these areas but they
 don't ask for much more money-- from HHS another $5.5 million, from
 Education another $2.2 million, EEOC $1.2. DOL and DOJ should get
 their's in tomorrow.     Of course, if we just gave the agencies what they
 asked for in their budget requests it was about $BO million.

         PIR (the english guy) called to say they were sitting in on the
 Raines meeting and wanted to discuss our package prior.    Regards, Tom ============

                                      CIVIL RIGHTS CROSSCUT DIRECTOR'S REVIEW
                                                     OVERVIEW


In June 1997, President Clinton launched his President's Initiative on Race (PIR), a campaign to improve race relations in the
post-Civil rights era by encouraging Americans to "learn together, talk together and act together to build one America" and to "help
educate Americans about the facts surrounding issues of race". The seven-member Board agreed at its first meeting July 14 to focus
its first initiatives on education and economic opportunity issues. President Clinton and Vice President Gore participated in a second
Board meeting on September 30, where the President reiterated his commitment to looking for practical steps that will move the
country. forward toward common goals. He called on the PIR to consider publishing a compendium of local efforts that address
promising practices of diverse communities in successfully promoting tolerance and models of behavior.

This crosscut review has three sections. The first section asks for decision on funding for the six principal civil rights enforcement
agencies and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The six enforcement agency proposals discussed in the issue papers comprise a
$56 million "Presidential Civil Rights Initiative", discussed below. The second and third section~ are informational only. The
second section discusses enforcement programs for which funding decisions are not requested, and programs that have been
considered "civil rights" related, but are non-enforcement in nature; decisions for these programs will be made in the context of agency
reviews. The third section discusses Administration efforts in a variety of areas that may be considered race-related.

The Domestic Policy Council's Civil Rights Working Group Efforts. The Domestic Policy Council '(DPC) and HTF Division
staff have been engaged for several months in meeting with both civil rights advocacy group leaders and agency officials to hear their
recommendations for improving Federal civil rights efforts. The advocates recommended a range of ideas including improved White
House coordination of civil rights policies and stronger enforcement of civil rights laws by and in the Federal Government. All
agreed strongly that a coordinated approach to civil rights policies, with a full-time senior person in the White House responsible for
civil rights issues, could assist in numerous ways, including: identifying civil rights priorities and focusing resources incrementally in
key areas which could aide the Assistant Secretaries in defending their budgets during the appropriations process; focusing the need
for Cabinet Secretaries to playa more visible role in advancing the Administration's civil rights agenda; giving strategic attention to
Presidential appointments and the timing of major initiatives; and coordinating the fight against discrimination by Federal agencies.

The DPC also conducted a series of meetings with Federal civil rights agencies including the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, and the civil 'rights offices of Education, HHS, Labor, and
HUD. These agency meetings were held to discuss ideas for assisting the Administration obtain its civil rights enforcement budgets
from the appropriators.
the proposals for agencies to conduct business more effectively and efficiently. A Presidential announcement would highlight a $56
million "Civil Rights Initiative" to assist the key civil rights enforcement agencies:
                to improve compliance;
                to implement greater use of altemative dispute resolution techniques;
                to invest in information systems upgrades; and
                to develop better data collection capabilities.

The increased funding would be more than a symbolic statement about the President's commitment to civil rights; it would provide the
enforcement agencies with badly needed resources. For example, EEOC could invest in technology and implement greater use of
mediation to quickly resolve complaints without significant increases in staffing. OFCCP would continue its streamlining and
compliance assistance initiatives. And our recommendation for RUD is to develop a targeted, audit-based enforcement initiative that
would raise the Nation's and communities' awareness of the extent of housing discrimination through focused and publicly released
audit results and subsequent enforcement action. Detailed agency proposals are discussed in the subsequent issue papers. The
funding levels for each agency are shown in the table below:

Civil Rights Information in the President's Budget. Both the advocates community and the civil rights agencies discussed the
need for better and more available data on civil rights programs. During President Clinton~s first term, there was no discussion on
civil rights programs in the annual budget presented to Congress. For the FY 1998 Budget, a brief discussion on overall funding for
civil rights activities in housing and employment was included in the short "Highlights of the Federal Budget" document in "Chapter
VI, Expanding Economic Opportunity". This contrasts sharply to fuller analyses of civil rights activities that had been an integral part
of the President's Budget through FY 1987. The "Special Analysis J" section (see Appendix A) listed budget authority for principal
federal civil rights activities and descriptions of the coverage and scope of voting rights, equal employment opportunity, fair housing.
and equal credit, activities of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and non-discrimination in Federally assisted programs. When the
FY 1988 budget was consolidated into a single document, the production of most special analyses ceased. With the resurrection of
the Analytical Perspectives component of the President's Budget in           , all of the previous analysis were again included, with the
exception of civil rights activities. OMB may want to include a civil rights section in the FY 1999 Budget as part of an
Administration effort to highlight government-wide program and financial information for civil rights activities.

Summary of Civil Rights Enforcement Funding. Most of the Federal dollars that go toward civil rights objectives are provided to
agencies for enforcing Federal civil rights statutes. In January 1997, at the request of Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights, the Housing, Treasury, and Finance Division developed a post-budget crosscut table of FY 1998 spending for civil
rights programs. The President proposed $608.6 million for Federal civil rights programs, a $51.7 million or 9.3 percent increase in        W~
budget authority over FY 1997. Funding increases were proposed for nearly every civil rights agency, spreading scarce Federal               6 ~
resources over a broad group of agencies and programs. The average increase in enforcement programs was 8.3 percent, with               ~ [
increases ranging from 3 percent for the EEOC to between 10 and 30 percent for Education's civil rights programs, Labor's OFCCP,        Q ~
HUD's fair housing activities, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Non-enforcement programs were proposed to increase 15.6             ~
