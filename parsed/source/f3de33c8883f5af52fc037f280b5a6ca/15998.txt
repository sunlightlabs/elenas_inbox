        President Continues to Fight to Expand Health Care Coverage for Our Nation's Children


Today the President joined Kaiser Permanente in announcing that the health plan will give $100 million to
provide health care coverage to up to 50,000 uninsured children in California. Kaiser is responding to the
President's challenge at the Summit on Service, and their initiative complements the President's commitment to
a national effort to extend health insurance.

This President will continue to fight hard to make sure that extending health care coverage to millions of
uninsured children is a top priority in any balanced budget deal. The President fought hard to ensure that
the balanced budget agreement included $16 billion to provide meaningful health care coverage to uninsured
children. The President also supports the action by the Senate Finance Committee to raise a 20 cent tobacco
tax to allocate additional Federal support for children's health.

The President outlined the principles he will use in evaluating children's health initiatives emerging from
the Budget Agreement. The President is committed to making sure that any investment in children's health
care meets three principles: (1) that coverage is meaningful: from checkups to surgery -- children should get
the care they need to grow up strong and healthy; (2) that coverage is targeted: through grant programs and
Medicaid, this investment should cover as many uninsured children as possible; and (3) that this investment
supplements not supplants coverage: this investment should cover children who do not currently have
insurance -- rather than replace public or private money that already covers children.

The Balanced Budget and the Kaiser announcement build on the President's previous successes in
strengthening health care coverage for children.

      Children and the Kassebaum-Kennedy Law. By signing this bill into law, the President helped
       millions of Americans -- and their children -- keep their health care coverage when they change jobs.

      Children and Medicaid. Throughout his Administration, the President has fought to preserve and
       strengthen the Medicaid program; its coverage of about 20 million children, makes it the largest single
       insurer of children. The Administration has partnered with states through Medicaid waivers to expand
       coverage to hundreds of thousands of children.

      Children and the Environment. The President signed an Executive Order to reduce environmental
       health and safety risks to children by requiring agencies to strengthen policies and improve research to
       protect children and ensure that new regulations consider special risks to children.

      Children and Tobacco. The President has also taken action to limit children's access to tobacco.
       Each day about three million children become regular smokers and 1,000 of them will die from a
       tobacco-related illness. To reduce this trend, the President issued guidelines to eliminate easy access to
       tobacco products and to prohibit companies from advertising tobacco to kids. According to former
       FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the possibility of a comprehensive, public health oriented settlement
       with the tobacco industry could not have come about without the President's leadership in this area.

      Children and Immunization. During the Clinton Administration, childhood immunizations have
       reached a historic high. The President's childhood immunization initiative expands community-based
       educational efforts and makes vaccines more affordable. In 1995, fully 75 percent of two-year olds
       were immunized -- an historic high.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

                     The Freddie Mac Section 8 Homeownership
                       Empowerment Voucher Pilot Program


Announcement

       Today, Freddie Mac has agreed to help make Homeownership available for up to 2,000
low income people through an innovative program proposed by the Clinton Administration. To
help guarantee the success of the Administration's proposal to permit the use of Section 8 rental
subsidies as Homeownership Empowerment Vouchers, Freddie Mac, in partnership with he
Department of Housing and Urban Development, will participate in a demonstration program to
help provide financing for 1,000 to 2,000 lower-income families to purchase their own homes.
This project will help make mortgage funds available to working, lower-income families across
the country who have demonstrated the ability to manage their finances but have not had the
means to purchase a home.

Background

        Under an administration proposal currently awaiting action by Congress, working
lower-income families that qualify for HUD's Section 8 rental housing assistance could instead
request Empowerment Vouchers to help reduce the gap between the amount the family can
afford and the monthly payment on a mortgage.

        Under the Freddie Mac pilot program, first-time homebuyers will obtain mortgages for up
to 97 percent of the value of their home, with the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation
providing private mortgage insurance on the loans. It is anticipated that a reasonable amount of
funds for the down payment will be contributed by the family. The remainder of the down
payment, and other funds necessary to close, may come from state or federal programs, gifts, or
grants. The borrower will contribute a reasonable percentage of his or her income towards
housing costs; the balance of the monthly mortgage payment will be provided through the
Empowerment Vouchers. The borrower will receive comprehensive homeownership counseling
before and after the purchase.

      Participation by Freddie Mac, a leading secondary market agency, and MGIC, a leading
mortgage insurer, is important because the underlying mortgages to be used with the
Empowerment Vouchers will be originated by private mortgage lenders. These lenders require
mortgage insurance and secondary market investors in order to originate the loans.

         President Clinton and HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo propose to provide responsible
working families with the option of using Empowerment Vouchers because homeownership is an
important component of an urban revitalization strategy. Homeownership encourages
self-sufficiency, allows families to develop community ties and support networks, encourages the
formation of household assets, assures continuity of schooling for children, stabilizes distressed
neighborhoods, and equalizes housing opportunities for minorities, whose homeownership rates
are far lower than those of the nation as a whole.
