Revised July 14, 1998

         EFFORTS TO REPEAL EXECUTIVE ORDER ISSUED MAY 28,1998
          PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION IN THE FEDERAL CIVILIAN
               WORKFORCE BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENT ATION

Background:

      Executive Order 13087 was issued on May 28, 1998. It amends an earlier executive
       order, Executive Order 11478. It restates the pre-existing policy of the Executive Branch
       of the Federal Government to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in
       federal civilian employment.

      Representative Hefley of Colorado and others have indicated that they will attempt to
       amend the TreasurylPostal appropriations bill to prohibit the use of federal funds to
       implement, enforce or administer the Executive Order. The Administration opposes this
       effort.

What exactly does the Executive Order provide?

      The Executive Order will ensure that there is a uniform policy throughout the Federal
       Government by adding sexual orientation to the list of categories (i.e. race, color,
       religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or age) for which discrimination is prohibited in
       hiring, firing and promotion in the civilian federal workforce, as provided for in
       Executive Order 11478.

      This policy is about basic fairness, not about "special rights."

Does this affect affirmative action policy or create special treatment for certain groups?

      No. Executive Order 13087 does not mandate affirmative action based on sexual
       orientation. It does not allow preferential treatment. It does not require that agencies
       find out which of their employees are gay, or how many gay employees they have hired.
       There are not quota programs in place for federal civilian hiring, and Executive Order
       13087 does not create one. Executive Order 13087 does not require reporting of sexual
       orientation, quotas, or any affirmative action program based on sexual orientation.

Is this a new policy?

      No. It has always been the practice of this Administration to prohibit discrimination in
       employment based on sexual orientation in the civilian workforce, and most federal
       agencies and department have taken actions, such as the issuance of policy directives or


                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
       states this policy uniformly and for the first time in an Executive Order of the President.

      Moreover, federal law has for a long time provided that discrimination in federal civilian
       employment based upon sexual orientation is a prohibited personnel practice if it is found
       that sexual orientation did not adversely affect the performance of the employee. [Title 5
       of the U.S. Code, section 2302(b)(10) prohibits "discriminat[ion] for or against any
       employee or applicant for employment on the basis of conduct which does not adversely
       affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others."]

      As far back as 1980, OPM has issued its interpretation of existing federal law stating that
       "applicants and employees are to be protected against inquiries into, or actions based
       upon, non-job-related conduct, such as religious, community, or social affiliations, or
       sexual orientation." .

Ifthis is not a new policy, why was an Executive Order necessary?

      The Executive Order states a uniform policy throughout the Executive Branch of the
       Federal Government.

What impact does this have on the uniformed military service?

      None. This order does not apply to the uniformed military service.

What, if any, enforcement rights are granted?

      This Executive Order states Administration policy but does not create any new
       enforcement rights. Those rights would be granted by legislation passed by the
       Congress, such as the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which the President
       supports.

What is the authority for the President to issue this executive order?

      Presidents since George Washington have directed Executive Orders to their employees
       in the Executive Branch. In 1966, Congress specifically authorized the President to
       "prescribe regulations for the conduct of employees in the executive branch." 5 U.S.C. 
       7301. Presidents have frequently exercised that authority ov~r the federal workforce,
       issuing scores of Executive Orders. This particular Order by President Clinton amends
       Executive Order 11478, issued in 1969 by President Nixon, barring federal employees
       from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap or age.
       The same authority that supported that Order supports this one. President Reagan issued
       Executive Order 12564, requiring a drug-free federal workplace, and Executive Order
       12353, governing charitable fundraising by federal employees. President Bush issued


                                                2
                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
       employees. It would be nonsensical to contend that the President can regulate the ethical
       conduct of federal employees, that he can prescribe standards for fundraising and require
       drug testing, but cannot instruct federal employees to refrain from discriminating on the
       basis of sexual orientation.

What is the meaning of the phrase "sexual orientation?"

      The President intends the term to have the common meaning stated in the
       Employment Non-Discrimination Act, "homosexuality, bisexuality, or
       heterosexuality." With regard to all these issues, as this is the President's order,
       the President's intent informs the meaning of the executive order. See Sea-Land
       Service, Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 738 F.2d 1311, 1314 (D.c. Cir.
       1984) ("The 'law' at issue in this instance is an Executive Order promulgated by the
       President, and it is to his intent that we must turn for guidance ... ").

Is this an attempt to legislate by executive order?

      This executive order does not amend Title VII or create new rights or remedies for
       discrimination based on sexual orientation. It is the role of Congress, and not the
       Executive Branch, to amend federal statutes.

      Unlike Title VII, which applies to employers generally, including private employers,
       Executive Order 13087 merely sets internal employment policy for the Executive Branch.

Would the executive order require federal contractors or state and local governments to
hire gays?

      This executive order applies only to employees of the Executive branch; it does not apply
       to federal contractors or grant recipients. Federal contractors are not "employees" of the
       Federal government.

Is there public support for the Executive Order?

      Recent national polls by Newsweek and the Associated Press indicate that between
       84-85% of Americans favor equal rights for gay people in the workplace.

      The proposed federal legislation on this topic, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,
       enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the 104th Congress, with 49 Senators voting for it
       and 139 House cosponsors. In addition, a majority of House Members and over
       two-thirds of the Senate have specifically indicated that sexual orientation was not a
       consideration in their own employment practices.
