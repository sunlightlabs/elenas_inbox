SEC.4. SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS.

         Section 903(b) ofthe Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. I 103 (b» is amended by adding

the following new paragraph:

               "(3)(A) If the Secretary of Labor finds that on December 31,2001, a State has not

achieved, or made substantial progress towards achieving, the solvency target established

pursuant to subparagraph (B), then, subject to the limitation described in subparagraph (C), the

amount available under this section for transfer to such State account for the succeeding fiscal

year shall, in lieu of being so transferred, be transferred to the States meeting the requirements of

this subsection. The transfers shall be made to such States based on the share of funds of each

such State under subsection (a)(2), except that for purposes of this subparagraph the ratio under

subsection(a)(2) shall be adjusted by excluding the wages attributable to the States failing to

meet the requirements of this subparagraph.

               "(B)(i) For December 31,2001, the solvency target shall be an average high cost

       multiple of 1.0. For purposes of this subparagraph, the average high cost multiple

       represents the number of years a State could pay unemployment compensation (based on

       the reserve ratio of such State) if the State paid such compensation at a rate equivalent to

       the average benefit cost rate such State paid in the three calendar years during the


                                                 5

       preceding 20 calendar years (or, iflonger, during the period consisting of the preceding

       three recessions as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research) that the

       benefit cost rates were the highest. For purposes of making this determination--

                      "(I) the term "reserve ratio" means the ratio determined by dividing the

       balance in the State account at the end of the calendar year by the total covered wages in

       the State for such year;

                      "(II) the term "benefit cost rate" means the rate determined by dividing the

       unemployment compensation paid during a calendar year by the total covered wages in

       the State for such year; and

                      "(III) the ratio and rates determined under subclauses (I) and (II) shall

       exclude the wages and unemployment compensation paid by employers covered under

       section 3309 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

       "(ii) For December 31, 2001, substantial progress towards achieving the solvency target

shall mean that a State has reduced any difference between 1.0 and the average high cost multiple

of such State ( if such multiple is less than 1.0) that the Secretary found to exist on December 31,

1998, by an amount equal to or exceeding 5 percent of such difference.

       "(iii) The Secretary may adjust the solvency target specified in clause (i), or the criteria

for determining whether there is substantial progress towards achieving the solvency target

specified in clause (ii), for States that experience significant increases in unemployment during

the period between December 31, 1998 and December 31, 2001. The Secretary shall establish

objective criteria for making such adjustments.

       "(iv) A State shall include, as part of the annual State plan relating to the administration

of grants under this title, such information as the Secretary may request relating to the manner in

which the State intends to achieve the solvency target established pursuant to this paragraph.

                "(C) The requirements of subparagraph (A) shall apply to excess amounts

(referred to in subsection (a)(I)) remaining in the employment security account at the close of

fiscal year 2002 that are equal to or less than $2,900,000,000. Such requirements shall not apply

to any such excess amounts that are greater than $2,900,000,000.".

               "(5) such employees are not required to meet the availability for work or work

search test requirements while collecting short-time compensation benefits, but are required to be

available for their normal workweek; .

               "(6) eligible employees may participate in an employer-sponsored training

program to enhance job skills if such program has been approved by the State agency;

               "(7) the State agency may require an employer to continue to provide health

benefits and retirement benefits under a defined benefit pension plan (as defined in section

               "(8) the State agency may require an employer (or an employers' association

which is party to a collective bargaining agreement) to submit a written plan describing the

manner in which the requirements of this subsection will be implemented and containing such

other information as the Secretary of Labor determines is appropriate; and

               "(9) the program meets such other requirements as the Secretary of Labor

determines are appropriate.".

(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.--

                                DRAFT 2/4/99




                    SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF SUBTITLE D

            THE UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION AMENDMENTS OF 1999




       Section 1 provides that the short title is the "Unemployment Compensation Amendments

of 1999".

       Section 2 contains amendments to the Federal-State Extended Benefit (EB) program.

       Section 2(a) amends the program to repeal certain special Federal requirements relating to

eligibility of claimants for extended benefits. The effect of the repeal is to apply the State

unemployment compensation law provisions regarding eligibility for regular compensation to the

EBprogram.

       Section 2(b) replaces the current "triggers" that result in the program taking effect in a

State, which are based on the rate of insured unemployment (IUR), with triggers based on the

total unemployment rate (TUR) of States. The rationale for this change is that the TUR better

reflects the general labor market conditions in a State than the IUR, which is a measure limited to

insured workers. Specifically, this subsection provides that a State is to trigger on the EB

program if: (1) the State TUR for th~ most recent 3-month period equals or exceeds 7.5% and the

TUR equals or exceeds 110 percent of the average TUR for either of the corresponding 3-month .


                                                 10
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

periods in the two preceding years; or (2) the TUR for the most recent 3-month period equals or

exceeds 10 percent.

       Section 2(c) provides that during high unemployment periods in a State the EB program

is to provide claimants with up to 20 weeks of extended benefits (under the regular triggers,

claimants are eligible for up to 13 weeks of benefits). Currently, only claimants in States that

have enacted an alternative TUR "trigger" under the program qualify for 20 weeks of benefits.

This subsection therefore makes the 20-week benefit "tier" available in all States that meet the

high unemployment period criteria. That criteria is defined as: (1) an average TUR for the most

recent 3-month period of 10 percent (with a "lookback" requirement that such rate equal or

exceed 110 percent of the rate for such period in either of the preceding two years); (2) an

average TUR for the most recent 3-month period that equals or exceeds 12.5 percent; or (3) in

those States that have enacted the alternative TUR trigger, an average TUR of 8 percent (with the

110 percent "lookback" for the two preceding years). This third measure is in current law.

       Section 2(d) clarifies that States will continue to have the option of two alternative

triggers for the EB program. The first alternative trigger is a TUR rate of 6.5 percent with 110

percent lookback (this would substitute for the 7.5 percent with the 110 percent lookback under

section 2(b) of the bill). The second alternative trigger (which would be in addition to rather

than in lieu of any other trigger) is an insured unemployment rate equal to or exceeding 6 percent

for the previous I3-week period. (Under current law, States may add this 6 percent lUR trigger

to the mandatory trigger, which is a 5 percent lUR with a two-year "lookback" of 120 percent.

       Section 3 amends the Reed Act (section 903 ofthe Social Security Act) to facilitate full

funding for the administration by the States of the unemployment compensation program for


                                                11
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


fiscal years 2000-2002. It also provides for $20 million in grants to the States in each of fiscal

years 2000, 2001, and 2002 to assist in the implementation of alternative base periods for

determining the eligibility of claimants. Under current law, most States have established the

base period for determining whether a claimant has earned sufficient wages to qualify for

unemployment compensation as the first four of the preceding five completed quarters. The

effect of not including the more recent quarter's wages is to exclude many low-wage workers and

new entrants to the workforce from eligibility. These grants are designed to assist States in

voluntarily implementing a base period that will count those claimants more recent wages and

thereby expand eligibility.

           Specifically, section 3 amends the current Reed Act provisions that limit distributions to

the States to $100 million in fiscal years 2000-2002. This section would provide for a

distribution that would equal the difference between the amount the Secretary estimates (based

on workload projections and other factors) the States will need to administer the unemployment

compensation program for each of the fiscal years 2000-2002 and $2.419 billion, which was the

amount requested on the discretionary side of the budget for fiscal year 2000 (after adjusting for

special activities). This section also includes $20 million in each of fiscal year 2000- 2002 to be

used by the Secretary to award grants to States to assist in the implementation of alternative base

periods.

       Section 4 provides for the establishment of a solvency target for State accounts in the

Unemployment Trust Fund.

       Specifically, section 4 provides that a State is to meet, or make substantial progress in

meeting, the solvency target established for December 31, 2001 in order to be eligible to receive


                                                   12
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

its share of the first $2.9 billion in Reed Act distributions in the succeeding fiscal year (FY

2003). If a State fails to meet this requirement, its share ofthe distribution would be transferred

to the States that meet the requirement.

       For December 31,2001 this section prescribes the solvency target as being an "average

high cost multiple" of 1.0. The average high cost multiple represents the number of years a

State could pay unemployment compensation (based on its "reserve ratio") if the State paid such

compensation at a specified "benefit cost rate." The specified rate is the benefit cost rate that is

the average of the three years during the previous 20 years (or, iflonger, during the period

consisting of the previous three recessions) in which the benefit cost rates were the highest. The

"benefit cost rate" is determined by dividing the unemployment compensation paid during a

calendar year by the total covered wages in the States for the same year. In essence, this formula

is designed to determine whether there are sufficient funds in a State account to cover benefit

payments during periods of high unemployment.

       This section also prescribes what constitutes "substantial progress" towards meeting the

solvency target for December 31, 2001. Ifby this date a State has reduced by 5 percent or more

any difference between its average high cost multiple (if less than 1.0) and 1.0 that existed as of

December 31, 1998, the State would be deemed to have made substantial progress and would be

eligible for the fiscal year 2003 Reed Act distribution. In addition, this section provides that

States are to include in the State Quality Service Plan, which is submitted pursuant to the

administrative grants under this title, such information as the Secretary may request relating to

the manner in which States intend to achieve the solvency target. Finally, this section provides

that the solvency requirements apply to a State's eligibility for the first $2.9 billion in Reed Act


                                                 l3
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

distributions for FY 2003, which is approximately one-half of projected total distribution for that

year. The remainder would be distributed in accordance with current State eligibility

requirements.

            Section 5 clarifies the requirements relating to short-time compensation

(worksharing) programs. Currently 18 States are carrying out such programs under which

employers reduce the workweeks of employees in lieu of temporary layoffs, and the affected

employees receive partial unemployment compensation for the reduction in hours. The

authority for the program originated in 1982, but there has been some question as to the

permissible elements of the program. This provision clarifies those elements in a manner

consistent with the current State programs.

       Section 6 provides that except for the amendments to the Extended Benefit program, the

provisions of the subtitle will take 'effect on the date of enactment. The EB program changes,

which require amendments to be made to State unemployment compensation laws, will take

effect not later than 2 year after the date of enactment. States may implement the changes earlier

than this date by enacting the necessary changes to their State laws.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT FOR POSSIBLE INCLUSION IN TRANSMITTAL
LETTER FOR SUBTITLE D- UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION AMENDMENTS
OF 1999

Subtitle D is entitled the "Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1999." This
legislation represents an important step toward ensuring that the unemployment compensation
program fulfills its mission in today's changing economy and that it remains on a sound financial
footing for the 21 st Century.

The subtitle has several major components. First, the subtitle would provide incentives to States
to implement administrative systems that will make the program more accessible to low-wage
workers. By enhancing access for low wage workers, this proposal would assist in increasing
the proportion of unemployed workers receiving unemployment compensation, which has
declined from a high of 49% in the 1950s to 35% in the 1990s. This would not only strengthen
the ecop.omic safety net for these workers, but would also enhance the ability of the
unemployment compensation program to meet one of its major objectives -- economic
stabilization. This proposal would provide $20 million in grants to States in each of fiscal years
2000, 200 I ,and 2002 to voluntarily implement a base period for determining eligibility of certain
claimants that takes into account the claimant's most recent earnings. Currently, most States do
not include an individual's earnings from the most recent quarter in the base period, which
results in excluding many low-wage workers and recent entrants to the labor market from
eligibility for unemployment compensation.

Second, the subtitle would enhance the Federal-State Extended Benefit (EB) program by revising
the program triggers to make extended benefits more readily available during a recession. In
addition to providing important assistance to unemployed workers, this change is intended to
avoid the situation that arose in the early 1990s when, despite a recession, so few States triggered
on the EB program that Congress enacted five successive versions of an Emergency
Unemployment Compensation program at a cost of$28.5 billion, financed entirely at Federal
expense. The proposal would use triggers based on total unemployment rates that are more
responsive to rising State unemployment and more accurately reflect when it is most difficult to
find work.

Third, the subtitle would encourage States to voluntarily improve the solvency of their
unemployment trust fund accounts and thereby their ability to pay benefits if unemployment
increases. Currently, State trust fund account balances represent a lower proportion of covered
wages than in earlier periods. In the event of a recession, inadequate balances could lead to such
actions by States as increasing taxes, reducing benefits, or significant borrowing of Federal
funds. In order to avoid this result, the subtitle proposes to provide an incentive to States with


                                                 15
                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

    inadequate trust fund reserves to improve solvency by conditioning receipt of a portion of funds
    distributed under the Reed Act in fiscal year 2003 on State trust fund accounts meeting or
    making substantial progress towards a solvency target.

    Fourth, the subtitle would strengthen the funding of the States for administration of the
    unemployment compensation program. There has been significant underfunding of
    administration for the program in recent years. This proposal would increase the amount of
    funding available to States under the Reed Act (which is on the mandatory side of the budget) for
    fiscal years 2000-2002 to an amount generally equal to the difference between the administrative
    needs ofthe States and $2.419 billion, which is the amount requested on the discretionary side of
    the budget for such activities for fiscal year 2000. This would facilitate full funding,
    significantly improving the ability of States to effectively serve claimants.

    Finally, the subtitle would also clarifY the requirements relating to short-time compensation
    programs, under which employers reduce the workweek of their employees in lieu of temporary
    layoffs and the affected employees receive partial unemployment compensation.

    In summary, the significant refonns proposed by this subtitle would result in increasing the
    access, equity and solvency of the unemployment compensation program.

    In addition, as stated in the President's budget, the Administration is also interested in further
    discussions with stakeholders and the Congress to develop broader, bipartisan refonns to the
    Unemployment Compensation system which addresses the following principles: expanding
    coverage and eligibility for benefits; streamlining filing and reducing tax burden where possible;
    emphasizing reemployment; combatting fraud and abuse; and improving administration.
