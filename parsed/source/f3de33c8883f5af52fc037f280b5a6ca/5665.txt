The attached document: (1) provides some background on what's going on in
U.K. reo welfare reform, (2) lays out--in a chart--options for톝itevisits
in four states, and (3) provides additional information about the possible
sites.   How do you suggest proceeding with scheduling memo--do you want
to pick your first choice for a site visit and send that forward, with
backup options available as needed, or should we send forward several
options? We'd be happy to discuss these sites with you to help narrow it

Background on where things stand in U.K. (based on press clips and recent visits of British
officials)
       Frank Field, the social security minister, has submitted a 'green paper' on welfare reform
        to the PM Blair for review. Apparently this takes a comprehensive, though general, look
        at reforming a wide range of benefit programs including pensions and disability benefits.
        Benefits to the disabled are a large and rapidly growing component of welfare spending.
        Proposals have been floated to cut benefits to the disabled, generating intense opposition
        from many in the Labour party.
       On December lOth, Parliament approved a cut in benefits for lone (single) parents. This
        was supported by Blair, Social Security secretary Harriet Harman, and Chancellor Gordon
        Brown. Apparently this was necessary to meet the budget targets set by the Tory
        Government. The proposal created a major revolt by Labour backbenchers, leading to
        several resignations, and 47 Labour MPs voting against the proposal. Blair and Brown
        justified their position as one of the 'hard choices' that Labour must make, demonstrating
        a commitment to live within tough spending limits and consistent with weaning single
        parents from welfare to work. As part of the package, Brown announced a new child care
        program and a "New Deal" jobs program to help people move into work. The cuts, and
        the new programs, are scheduled for implementation in April.
       Concern about promoting responsibility, reducing dependency, and addressing
        underclass. One in 3 children in Britain are born out of wedlock. On December 8th,
        Blair launched a new "Social Exclusion Unit" intended to prevent the further
        development of an underclass. This group will focus on: tackling the problems of school
        expUlsion and chronic truancy, reducing the number of people sleeping on the streets, and
        improving the qualify oflife on the worst 'housing estates' (presumably, and ironically,
        this translates to housing projects in U.S. English).
       Interest in requiring single parents to work sooner. Currently they are able to collect
        benefits until their youngest child is 16. They are now being invited in on a voluntary
        basis to participate in employment and training assistance. It remains to be seen whether
        this will occur on a large scale--funding is not adequate to make it mandatory.
       Time limits, contracting/privatization, teen parent residency requirement are apparently
        off the table.
       Commitment to some form of safety net--empower rather than punish.
       Trying to break cycle of dependency--may be focusing initially on young people (18-24)
        who are unemployed, come from dependent households, etc.
       Welfare reform in Britain appears to be more directly motivated by budget issues than in
        U.S.
       Interested in improving Job Centres (if anyone saw Full Monty, they don't look very
        effective!).
       At end of September, Blair gave first address to Labour's annual conference. Themes
        were very familiar: Shift from looking at people's barriers to their resources, disability to
        ability, new role for public sector (organizer, regulator, cajole, compel people to work, no
        longer the safety net).
       Interested in encouraging those who have been disabled and unemployed to return to
        work. This includes many unemployed men with'redundant' skills, e.g. steel workers and
        miners.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SITES:

MARYLAND
(1) The state has a contract with Giant Foods to train and place approximately 80 people. To date, Giant has hired 45 welfare
recipients. This is a partnership between Giant, the PIC, and the local welfare office in Prince Georges County. Giant provides the PIC
with hiring requirements. The local welfare office identifies possible candidates and does initial screening and selection. Those who


                                                                         Automated ReC{)rds Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion



meet criteria go to PIC for a two week pre-employment training. Giant hires and provides 6 weeks of paid on the job training (funded
by the state). Individuals are hired as cashiers, pharmacy and bakery clerks, and meat wrappers, as union employees with full benefits
and wages commensurate with others in the food industry. A job coach is available to help people succeed on the job and work with
the local welfare agency to solve problems, arrange support services, etc. The fact that individuals are welfare recipients is kept
confidential and invisible to other employees. Initial numbers look good and apparently clients are clamoring to join this program.
Site information: training takes place at Giant's training facility in Greenbelt. MD. Welfare recipients participate in the same training
as other new hires. Visit could either be to the training facility or to a Giant store, though the training facility would probably make
more sense.

(2) Anne Arundel County has a one-stop job center that has gotten a lot of positive attention. It integrates the Department of Labor's
automated job bank and social services at one site and provides lots of flexibility to provide whatever services people need to get
employed and leave welfare. The center serves as a single point of contact for any job seeker (welfare or not). Maryland staff
indicate this makes a good visit.

(3) The Job Connection is a public-private partnership with local departments of welfare, small businesses, local chambers of
commerce and APG (a national consulting finn that supports small businesses). The goal is to place 2,500 welfare recipients over the
next 27 months. The project has been operating for several months. Small businesses notify the Job Connection (via a 1-800 number)
when they have a vacancy. The Job Connection geocodes the job location, and provides geocoded infonnation about nearby
supportive services, i.e. child care and transportation. They then fax this infonnation to the local welfare department, who has 72
hours to respond with job candidates. Once someone is hired, APG and the Chamber help the small business qualify for federal and
state tax credits.
Site infonnation: The Job Connection is based in Columbia, MD. Most of the work at the site is'virtual'--i.e. by phone and fax. We
could see staff receiving and making referrals and geocoding information, but would not likely see welfare to work participants.

MILWAUKEE
We could visit one of the Wisconsin Works (W-2) Job Centers. These are one-stop employment centers for job seekers and
employers. They are each operated by a different private contractor (Goodwill, YW Works, Opportunities Industrialization Center,
Maximus, and United Migrant Opportunity Service). The Private Industry Council of Milwaukee serves as the W-2 Contracts
Administrator and coordinator for all 5 contractors.

           NOTE: a British parliamentary delegation recently visited Wisconsin, and representatives from
           Blair's administration attended a recent trans-Atlantic seminar on welfare reform sponsored by
           Hudson Institute.

           INDIANA
           Indiana is proud of several welfare reform initiatives. While it is not a county-administered
           welfare system, there is a strong emphasis on devolution and local involvement in planning and
           designing welfare reform. Funds are provided to support local initiatives, particularly to build
           community supports to ensure that people leaving welfare are successful in maintaining
           employment and self-sufficiency. The state feels it has successfully gone through the culture
           change to work first (confirmed in a recent Abt evaluation). It is now dealing with the next stage,
           i.e. what happens once someone gets a job and leaves welfare. They are focusing on life long
           learning and increasingly partnering with businesses to address the longer term self-sufficiency
           issues. [I will follow up after the W2W Partnership event on 12115 to get suggestions on a
           possible site to visit.]

           They have just launched a major public-private partnership on child care with large companies
           putting private dollars into a fund to support child care initiatives around the state (not restricted
           to current/former welfare recipients). Indiana has transferred $62 million in TANF savings to the
           CCDF to boost child care funds available for working families. Like many places, Indiana finds
           transportation to be a major chllllenge. The state is about to award $5 million in 'barrier busting'
           grants to localities, with about 85% of the grants focusing on transportation. Particularly in rural
           and suburban areas, mass transit is not sufficient to address the needs of welfare recipients going
           to work. Local areas will use funds to help people repair cars, make car loans, pay for drivers
           licenses, etc.                     .

           FYI: A class action suit on family cap was recently filed in Indiana.

           FLORIDA
           Staff in the Governor's Washington office is exploring potential initiatives/sites with state staff
           and will get back to us by the end of the week with some ideas. They have suggested
           coordinating the State WAGES board (the private/public board governing the program) as well
           as the local WAGES coalition wherever we might want to visit. Generally, Florida's welfare
           reform program is thoughtful, well managed, relatively mature. One interesting item that I'm
           getting more information about--they have evidence of improved school performance of children
           whose parents went to work through welfare reform.

           Florida has invested significant state funds in child care and has a Child Care Purchasing Pool to
           provide subsidies to low-income working parents who would otherwise be on waiting lists.
           Public funds are matched dollar for dollar with private and local funds.
