 Elena--

 As you look over these materials, one additional piece of information to
 factor in: it turns out that the ACE conference scheduled for February 8
 will be held in San Fransisco.   If the document is first released
 publicly there, some in CA might interpret that as some kind of challenge
 to prop 209.  If the goal is to keep this low-key, or at least relatively
 non-political, then it might be better to go public with it prior to the
 conference; however, I would imagine any discussion of the guidance is
 going to get attention in California, even if the document isn't
 completely "new."

 Thanks.

 Subject:         Draft memo on rollout of guidance



 Elena--

 Attached is a draft memo to you and Sylvia from Dawn and me on a possible
 rollout strategy for the self-assessment guidance on affirmative action
 for colleges and universities.    Mike and Julie F. have reviewed/commented
 and are fine with this.  Before we sent this forward we wanted to make
 sure you were comfortable with it. Also, I wanted to get your take on
 whether we should run this by Judy Winston/others in the race initiative
 or Bob Shireman/NEC (because of the link with the mentoring initiative).



I am leaving tomorrow afternoon on vacation, and will be out until a week
from Tuesday,  but I can come in tomorrow morning if necessary to make
changes to this.  Otherwise, please follow up with Dawn.

Dawn --

If this goes forward on Monday, please note at the end of the memo that I
will be out next week so questions should go to you.

Thanks.

- - Bill

MEMORANDUM FOR SYLVIA MATHEWS AND ELENA KAGAN

FROM:          DA WN CHIRWA AND BILL KINCAID

RE:            Rollout of Self-assessment Guidance on Affirmative Action for Institutions of
               Higher Education.

This week we met with ED and DOJ to review the status of the self-assessment guidance on
affirmfltive action for institutions of higher education. We reached rough agreement on most
substantive issues and ED and DOJ are making additions/modifications to make the document
more user-friendly and to better convey Administration support for properly conducted
affirmative action programs. We expect to have a document ready to go into final by the second
week in January. At this point we are working to develop an appropriate roll-out strategy and
would appreciate your input.

We believe that the goals of the roll-out strategy should be: I) make sure that appropriate
postsecondary institutions get this information quickly and are able to put it to work, thus
speeding and strengthening campus efforts to ensure that affirmative action programs comply
with the law; 2) ensure that the civil rights community is aware of the Administration's
continued support for properly conducted affirmative action programs in education; 3)
demonstrate a substantive step forward that supports the President's Race Initiative; 4) time the
release in relation to announcement of the new mentoring initiative and other action steps so it is
perceived as part of broader administration efforts to ensure diversity in higher education, and 5)
avoid unnecessarily fanning dispute over affirmative action.

We think the following approach should meet these goals. Bracketed elements could be added
in depending on how aggressive we want to be in promoting the guidance and building these
actions up for the press as a part of the race initiative, although none of the steps outlined are
especially high profile. From the perspective of getting the document into the hands of higher
education institutions and assisting them to proceed with needed internal reviews quickly and
with the least possible controversy, the low-key course is probably best; we know that ACE, the
umbrella group for higher ed institutions which is very supportive of this effort, would prefer
such a strategy. However, demonstrating action with respect to the Race Initiative might dictate
a more visible approach.

      Week of Jan. 12 -- hold briefing at WH to walk through document with small number of
       key leaders in the civil rights and education community (such as Wade Henderson with
       the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Tom Henderson with the Lawyers'
       Committee on Civil Rights, and Stan Ikenberry with ACE). [Share document with leaders
       who are asked to close hold and provide comments within a week].

       Week of Jan. 19 -- hold briefing at ED to walk through document with larger number of

                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

      Late Jan. -- appropriately address comments from civil rights and education community.

      [Late Jan. -- Department of Education is working on reports on the value of diversity in
       higher education and successful approaches to fostering diversity. These reports, if
       well-done, could be released in build-up to announcement ofmentoring initiative and to
       lay the groundwork for release of self-assessment guidance].

      Jan. 27 to Feb. 3 -- President announces new mentoring initiative in or around the time of
       the State of the Union Address, and proposed funding for the program will be included in
       the FY 99 budget submission. In rolling out the mentoring initiative, officials should
       stress that one important benefit is that it would help open up the pipeline to higher
       education for more disadvantaged minority students and help foster campus diversity.

      [Feb. 7 -- Provide self-assessment guidance to friendly paper emphasizing how it is part
       of broader Administration efforts to foster diversity in higher education].

      Feb. 8 -- ED shares guidance publicly at already-scheduled ACE Conference.

      [Feb. 9 -- Secretary Riley sends guidance to higher education institutions and announces
       the Department will be holding a series of regional forums to assist institutions to review
       their affirmative action programs. Cover letter could also discuss importance of
       diversity in higher education and encourage institutions to get involved in mentoring
       ini tiati ve.]

      Early March -- ED holds first regional meeting on affirmative action self-assessment at
       Penn (already scheduled).

Please let us know what you think of this approach. We would be happy to meet with you to
discuss.
