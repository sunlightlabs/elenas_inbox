                            PRESIDENT CLINTON:
                       GETTING TOUGH ON HATE CRIMES

President to Announce·Significant New Law Enforcement and Prevention Initiatives


         "Hate crimes ... leave deep scars not only on the victims, but on our larger
 community. They weaken the sense that we are one people with common values and a
 common future. They tear us apart when we should be moving closer together. They are
 acts ofviolence against America itself. ... "

          "As part of our preparation for the new century, it is time for us to mount an all-out
assault on hate crimes, to punish them swiftly and severely, and to do more to prevent them
from happening in the first place. We must begin with a deeper understanding of the problem
itself. "
                                  President Clinton, Radio Address to the Nation, June 7, 1997




           THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON HATE CRIMES

                                       November 10, 1997

         On November 10, 1997, the President will convene the first-ever White House
Conference on Hate Crimes, a day-long event to be held at The George Washington University.
At the Conference, the President will announce significant law enforcement and prevention
initiatives to get tough on hate crimes. The Conference will examine the positive actions that
communities are taking and outline the steps we all can take to prevent hate crimes.

        A hate crime is the embodiment of intolerance -- an act of violence against a person or
property based on the victim's race, color, gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or
disability. Every year, thousands of Americans are victims of hate crimes -- and it is suspected
that many more go unreported. Teenagers and young adults account for a significant proportion
of the country's hate crimes -- both as perpetrators and victims. Every time one of these crimes is
committed it creates tension and fear, and tears at the fabric of community life.

        The Conference is an important element ofthe President's Initiative on Race and of his
vision for One America. Members of the President's Advisory Board on Race will participate in
the Conference at satellite locations.
                                                                            \ '.It C1tTlUtcd
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
                                    CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS

             The President, Vice President, Attorney General and Secretary of Education will be .
     joined by other members of the Cabinet, Members of Congress, selected state and local officials,
     and approximately 3S0 leaders from the law enforcement, civil rights, anti-violence, youth,
     education, and religious communities.

              Hate crimes survivors will also attend. Participants will include representatives from all
     ·50 states. Thousands more will participate at over 50 satellite-linked events across the country.

     distinguished Americans will join.

     issue. Afterward, the Attorney General will chair a closing panel to discuss ideas and themes
     from the working sessions. Participants will attend a closing reception at the United States
     Holocaust Museum.
