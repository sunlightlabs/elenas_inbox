                                  April 19, 1997

A CHALLENGE TO CONNECT EVERY CLASSROOM TO THE INTERNET. Last year,
President Clinton challenged America to connect every classroom and library to the Internet by the year
2000, with modem computers, educational software, and teachers that are as comfortable with a
computer as they are with a chalkboard. This effort will ensure that, for the first time in our history,
children from rural, suburban, and inner city schools will have the same access to the same universe of
knowledge.

AMERICA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES. To help achieve this goal, the President and Vice
President launched a $2 billion, five-year Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, with $200 million in
funding approved in 1996. In the last two years, the percentage of classrooms connected to the
Internet has quadrupled, and the percentage of schools connected to the Internet has almost doubled,
jumping from 35% to 65%.

TODAY, PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT GORE ANNOUNCE NEW
ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS TO MAKE EVERY CHILD TECHNOLOGICALLY
LITERATE. Following today's announcement, the President and Vice President will conduct a
video-conference from the Oval Office with children in Connecticut and NetDay volunteers in Los
Angeles.

       President Issues Directive to Federal Agencies on "Educational Content" on the Internet.
       The President today will issue a Presidential Memorandum directing agencies to expand the
       availability of federal resources on the Internet that have educational value. For example,
       NASA currently allows students to share in scientific pursuits such as exploration of Mars and
       experiments conducted on the Space Shuttle, and interact in real-time with astronauts.

       President Calls on FCC to Approve Plan for "E-rate." On May 6, the FCC will vote on a
       plan to provide discounts to connect schools and libraries to the Internet. The E-rate, or
       education rate, would provide up to $2.25 billion in discounts/or schools and libraries per
       year.

       President Awards New Technology Grants for States. The President and Vice President
       are announcing that ten states and territories have been awarded $11.8 million in grants under
       the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund. These include Alaska, Connecticut, Kansas,
       Nebraska, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Northern Mariana, American Samoa, and the
       Bureau of Indian Affairs schools. The Technology Literacy Challenge Fund is designed to
       catalyze state, local, and private sector efforts to make every child technologically literate.
       These states and territories join 14 other states that have already been awarded a total of $57
       million this year.

TODA Y'S ANNOUNCEMENT BUILDS ON THE SUCCESS SINCE THE FIRST NETDA YIN
1996. Since last year, NetDay has spread across the country like wildfire, ensuring that thousands of
schools are wired for the Internet. In 1996, an estimated 250,000 volunteers wired 50,000 schools as a
first step towards Internet access. AmeriCorps has also played an important role in this effort. And
organizers report that -- today alone -- NetDay activities are occurring in more than 40 states. In
Florida, for example, NetDay volunteers are expected to wire 500 schools, putting Florida half-way to

PRESIDENT AWARDS NEW TECHNOLOGY GRANTS TODAY. Today, President
Clinton will announce that 10 states and territories had been awarded $11.8 million in grants
under the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, administered by the Department of Education.
These states and territories join 14 other states that have been awarded a total of $57 million
earlier this year. Today's grants to new states and territories include:

Alaska                 $1.0   million         South Dakota         $1.0 million
Connecticut            $1.5   million         Tennessee                   $3.5 million
Kansas                 $1.5   million         Northern Mariana            $0.1 million
Nebraska               $1.0   million         America Samoa               $.24 million
Nevada                 $1.0   million         Bureau oflndian Affairs     $1.0 million


FOUR GOALS FOR EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY. President Clinton and Vice
President Gore have challenged the nation to ensure that all children are technologically literate
by the dawn of the 21 st century, equipped with the communication, math, science, reading,
and critical thinking skills essential for a life-time of learning and the workplace of the 21 st
century. They have asked the private sector, schools, teachers, parents, students, and
communities to work together to achieve the President's four goals for educational technology:

              Provide all teachers the training and support they need to help students learn using
               computers and the Internet;
              Develop effective and engaging software and on-line learning resources as an
               integral part of the school curriculum;
              Provide access to modem computers for all teachers and students; and
              Connect every school and classroom in America to the Internet by the year 2000.


THE TECHNOLOGY LITERACY CHALLENGE FUND DIRECTLY SERVES THESE
GOALS. To help achieve these four national goals, President Clinton launched a $2 billion,
five-year Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, with $200 million in funding approved by the
Congress in 1996. The President has requested $425 million in funding in his FY98 budget. The
Technology Literacy Challenge Fund is designed to catalyze state, local and private sector efforts
to reach the goals for education technology.

              States Playa Large Role. States are given a great deal of flexibility in their use
               of the funds. They are asked to develop a strategy that meets the four national
               goals, pursue collaboration with the private sector, target assistance to poor
               schools, and report annually to the public on the progress that has been made.

                    COMMUNITIES ACROSS AMERICA GET WIRED



FROM A FIRST STEP IN 1996. . . On March 9, 1996, President Clinton and Vice
President Gore participated in California's NetDay, the first ever "electronic barnraising."
 The President and Vice President helped to elevate NetDay by convening a group of
high-tech industry leaders who agreed to back it. They joined tens of thousands of
parents, teachers, engineers, union members and other volunteers to install more than 6
million feet of cable in California's schools in a single day. Companies donated wiring
kits, Internet access, hardware and software.


. . . TO GREAT STRIDES IN 1997. Since then, NetDay has spread across the country
like wildfire, with major national NetDays occurring on October 19, 1996 and April 19,
1997. Today, communities in more than 40 states are participating in NetDay. Many
communities are now beginning to look at issues beyond wiring, such as teacher training.

Below are just a few of the states and local communities that have gotten involved in
NetDay:


Alabama: Alabama plans to wire all classrooms, media centers and administrative offices in all
K-12 public schools by June 1, 1997.

California: On April 19, volunteers from AFL-CIO member unions will be helping to wire
schools in the Los Angeles Empowerment Zone, part of the AFL-CIO's commitment to help wire
500 Empowerment Zone schools by the end of 1997. Organizers of Silicon Valley's
SmartSchools NetDay estimate that 80 percent of the 496 local public K-12 schools will have
installed a high-speed network by April 26, 1997, with the help of 10,000 volunteers. In
addition, local businesses have donated 3,000 personal computers to schools.

Connecticut: In Connecticut, 4,000 volunteers have helped wire 600-700 of 1,600 schools and
libraries, with support from 100 small businesses, large corporations, and non-profit
organizations. Connecticut will be using April 19 to begin organizing a Youth TechCorps, an
initiative to identify and recognize Connecticut children with technology skills, and provide them
with mentoring, service, scholarship and business opportunities.

Delaware: During last year's NetDay, Delaware volunteers wired 70 out of300 schools.

District of Columbia: 40 ofD.C.'s 150 schools were wired in the fall of 1996, and another 30
have signed up to participate in April and May. Companies have donated laptop computers,
WebTVs, extensive teacher training, and wiring kits.

Florida: Organizers expect 500 schools to participate in NetDay on April 19, putting Florida
more than half-way to its goal of wiring 100% of its public and private K-12 school~.!T'

April 19.

Massachusetts: Massachusetts had a very successful NetDay on April 5, with 450 schools
participating. During this school year, nearly 40 percent of the schools have participated, with
14,000 volunteers and $14 million worth of support from companies. AmeriCorps members
will be involved in this ongoing effort.

Michigan: The Detroit Public School District has a very aggressive NetDay plan in place for
their 263 schools. Of this number, 70 are already wired, and about 100 plan to wire on April 19.

New Jersey: New Jersey organizers will be holding a NetDay every Saturday in April, and are
planning on wiring 1,000 schools by the end of 1997. Trenton has launched an effort to become
the first "wired city" by connecting every school, public library and community center.

North Carolina: An estimated 26,000 volunteers wired 900 public and private schools on
October 26, 1996, something that would have cost taxpayers $13.5 million.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the state's largest system, is wiring 110 of its 130 schools beginning this
spring.

Texas: The Houston Independent School District will wire libraries in 80 schools this month,
twenty each Saturday in April. For schools already wired, the NetDay concept will be expanded
to include "Phase II" NetDay events focusing on teacher training and curriculum development.

Wisconsin: Organizers expect 300-500 schools to participate in NetDay on April 19.
