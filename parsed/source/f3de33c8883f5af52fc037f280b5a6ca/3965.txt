                           IN HIGHER EDUCATION MEETING

                                      AUGUST 13, 1997


SUMMARY

         The Administration is investigating options to ensure diversity in higher education in
light of some of the effects of the Hopwood decision and the University of California Board of
Regents' decision to exclude race as a factor in admissions. Two approaches to the problem are
being pursued simultaneously: (1) litigation to reverse the decision and/or law and (2) policy
initiatives to improve diversity in higher education. This meeting is not concemed with the
litigation strategy, but rather with some possible policy initiatives that could be implemented
both long-term and short-term.


I.     ACTIONS BEING TAKEN IN CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS

       A.     CALIFORNIA

             Forming "school-centered partnerships" among each UC campus and public
              schools chosen for their poor academic performance, to establish standards and to
              improve student achievement.

             Expanding academic outreach programs for K-12 students.

             Creating an "information outreach" program to help students and their families
              prepare for college.

             Alternative admissions strategies. A June 24, 1997 article in the Sacramento
              Bee set out how each ofUC's nine campuses will "experiment" with different
              admissions policies in an effort to achieve diversity. UC-Davis: in filling 40% of
              the places in its 1998 freshman class, UC-Davis will give weight to factors other
              than grades and test scores such as extracurricular leadership experience;
              attendance at a high school that is economically disadvantaged and has a
              historically low level ofUC attendance; residence in the three counties closest to
              the university; military service; and marked academic improvement in the 11 th
              grade. The new policy is only triggered, however, by students who meet UC
              minimum eligibility requirements of a combined 1000 on the SAT and a high
              school grade-point average of2.82 in designated college preparatory courses.

                                               1
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

           UCLA: will give an advantage to applicants from disadvantaged urban and rural
           neighborhoods. UC Irvine: will look at an applicant's entire profile, not just
           grades and scores, including personal essays and extracurricular activities. UC
           San Diego: will look at "special circumstances and personal challenges" which
           could include whether an applicant is trying to become the first in his or her
           family to attend college.

          A July 9, 1997 Education Daily article says that the UC Task Force's $60 million
           dollar plan to increase minority enrollment at UC would make training and
           retaining teachers in disadvantaged schools a priority. The Task Force estimates
           the total cost of professional development at $18.5 million annually or about
           $370,00 at each of 450 schools --the disadvantaged high schools, plus 400
           "feeder" elementary and middle schools. On July 17, 1997, a Board of Regents
           committee approved the plan to double UC's annual spending on outreach
           efforts--which seek to increase minority enrollment without using affirmative
           action--from $60 million to $120 million. The $60-million additional cost
           projection for the program includes $27.2 million for school outreach efforts,
           $17.9 million for expanding academic programs that target black and Latino
           students but are open to all, and $7.9 million for contacting students, families and
           schools about UC admissions requirements.

      B.   TEXAS

          The Texas legislature passed a bill that automatically admits the top 10% of all
           Texas high schools students to the state's university system.

                   Ethnic Recruitment Program in which Texas residents may apply for
                    grants up to $1,000. Applicants must have a2.75 GPA and 900 SATs. The
                    awards may be used at any school in which their minority group
                  . constitutes less than 40% of total enrollment. [The Big Book of Minority
                    Opportunities]
