           PRESIDENT CLINTON UNVEILS NEW STEPS TO ADDRESS EMERGING CRISIS OF lHE UP
                TO 40 MILLION CHILDREN WHO WILL BE ORPHANED BY HIV/AIDS BY 2010,
                                 COMMEMORATES WORLD AIDS DAY
                                        December 1, 1998

     Today, President Clinton, commemorating World AIDS Day, joined Secretary of State Madeleine
     Albright and U.S. Agency for Intemational Development (USAID) Administrator Brian Atwood, to
     launch a series of new initiatives to address the growing crisis of children orphaned by AIDS. The
     President unveiled historic new increases at the National Institutes of Health dedicated to fund
     research aimed at developing an effective AIDS vaccine and new prevention strategies to help
     address the problem of HIV/AIDS throughout the world; announced new emergency funding from
     USAID to support intemational community-based AIDS orphan programs; and directed his AIDS
     policy advisor Sandra Thurman to lead a delegation to southem Africa to assess the growing
     problem of AIDS orphans and recommend new strategies for responding. The President:

    . ./       Highlighted USAIDS projection that up to 40 million children who will be orphaned by
               HIV/AIDS by 2010, over 90 percent of which live in developing countries that have too few
               resources to provide for their care and support. Globally, there are over 33 million people
               with HIV or AIDS, with another 5.8 million becoming infected every year. As with so many
               epidemics, children and young people are bearing much of the terrible burden of AIDS. In
               the United States, as many as 80,000 children have already been orphaned by AIDS.

               Announced 30 percent increase this year in funding by the National Institutes of
               Health on research to prevent and treat HIV around the world. The National Institutes
               of Health, representing the largest single public investment in AIDS research in the world,
               will support a comprehensive program of basic, clinical, and behavioral research on HIV
               infection and its related illnesses. These will include:

                  $200 million investment in research on AIDS vaccines to prevent transmission
                   around the world, a thirty-three percent increase this year alone~ The
                   development of a safe and effective AIDS vaccine is critical to stemming the growing
                   problem of HIV/AIDS and AIDS orphans across the world. The President announced
                   that NIH will dedicate $200 million in vaccine research in Fiscal Year (FY) 1999, a $47
                   million increase from FY1998 and an 100 percent increase since FY1995. This
                   investment is critical in supporting the President's challenge to make AIDS vaccine
                   research a national and intemational priority.

                  $164 million for other new research critical to addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic
                   across the world. The President also announced that the NIH 'hill invest $164 million,
                              a
                   in FY1999, $38 million increase, over last for critical projects to reduce the number of
                   AIDS orphans by preventing and treating HIV/AIDS intemationally, including: a new
                   prevention trials network to reduce adult and perinatal transmission of HIV/AIDS; new
                   strategies to prevent and treat HIV infection in children; funding to train more foreign
                   scientists to collaborate on this epidemic; research on the prevention and treatment of
                   the opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, that commonly kill people with
                   HIV/AIDS; and research on topical microbicides and other female-controlled barrier
                   methods of HIV prevention.




               Unveiled $10 million in emergency relieffunding at USAID to provide support for AIDS

                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

         orphans. USAID will make available $10 million in emergency funding to support
         community-based efforts for orphans, including training and support for foster families,
         initiatives to keep children in school, vocational training, and nutritional enhancements. In
         addition, USAID will take steps to help prevent the spread of HIV from mothers to children
         and to improve medical care for children already infected with HIV.

         Directed AIDS Policy Advisor Sandra Thurman to lead fact-finding delegation to raise
         awareness and make recommendations to growing address problem of AIDS
         orphans. President Clinton asked Sandra Thurman, Director of the Office of National AIDS
         Policy, to lead a fact-finding delegation to southem Africa, where 90 percent of AIDS
         orphans reside. The delegation will include representatives from across the Clinton
         Administration, key Congressional offices, and the national media to raise awareness about
         this emerging problem and to develop recommendations for action.

         Unveiled new steps to address the continued need of those living with HIV/AIDS in
         the United States. While the problem of AIDS orphans is most acute intemationally, the
         President also underscored that HIV/AIDS impacts and displaces tlmilies in this country as
         well. The President highlighted that today the Vice President will be unveiling over $200
         million in funds for the Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS program this year to
         assist communities around the country to keeping individuals affected by HIV/AIDS and their
         families from becoming homeless. The Vice President will announce these grants at a meet
         with local community leaders who provide housing and other support services for people
         living with HIV/AIDS, as II'.eIl as several individuals and families who hav.e benefited from
         their services.                                                                             '

         Built on a solid record of achievement in HIV/AIDS. Today's announcements build on a
         deep ongoing commitment by the Clinton Administration to respond to the AIDS crisis both
         in the United States and across the world. The Administration has fought for other critical
         investments in HIV/AIDS. This year alone, the President:

            Declared HIV/AIDS in racial and ethnic minOrity communities to be a se-.ere and
             ongoing health care crisis and unveiled a new $156 million initiative to address this
             problem, including crisis response teams, enhanced prevention efforts, and assistance
             in accessing state-of-the-art therapies all targeted toward ethnic and racial minorities in
             communities across the country;

            Worked with Congress to secure historic increases in a wide range of effective
             HIV/AIDS programs. Increases this year alone include: a $262 million increase in the
             Ryan White CARE Act; a 12 percent increase in AIDS research funding at the NIH, a
             $32 million increase HIV prevention programs at the CDC; and a $21 million increase in
             the Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS program at HUD.
