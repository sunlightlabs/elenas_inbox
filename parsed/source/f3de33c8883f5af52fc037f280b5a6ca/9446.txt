                                          September 24,1998


TODAY, THE CENSUS BUREAU RELEASED THEIR ANNUAL REPORT ON INCOME AND
POVERTY IN AMERICA FOR 1997. HERE ARE SOME OF THE RESULTS:

Broad-Based Income Gains:

      Typical Household Income Up 1.9 Percent in 1997. Income for the median household
       rose $699, from $36,306 in 1996 to $37,005 in 1997, adjusted for inflation.

      Typical Family Income Up $3,517 Since 1993. Another measure of income -- family
       income, which excludes single individuals and counts only related members in any
       household -- shows a similar trend. Last year, the median family's income, adjusted for
       inflation, increased 3.0 percent (or $1,297) -- the fourth consecutive annual rise. Since
       President Clinton's Economic Plan passed in 1993, median family income has increased
       from $41,051 in 1993 to $44,568 in 1997 -- that's a $3,517 increase in income, adjusted
       for inflation. From 1988 to 1992, median family income fell $1,835, adjusted for
       inflation.

      Under President Clinton, The Typical African-American Household's Income Is Up $3,354. The
       median income of African-American households rose 4.3 percent (or $1,029) last year. And
       since 1993, the median income of African-American households has increased from $21,696
       to $25,050 -- that's $3,354 or a 15-percent increase, adjusted for inflation, between 1993 and
       1997.

      Income of Typical Hispanic Household Up $2,553 in Past Two Years.      In 1997, the
       income of the median Hispanic household, adjusted for inflation, increased from $25,477
       in 1996 to $26,628 in 1997 -- that's an increase of $1,151 or 4.5 percent. Over the past
       two years, the income of the typical Hispanic household has risen $2,553 -- or nearly 11
       percent -- the largest two-year increase in Hispanic income on record.

      After Rising Sharply for 20 Years, inequality Has Stabilized. After risi~g for nearly 20
       years, income inequality has not changed significantly over the past four years. Since
       1993, every income group -- from the most well-off to the poorest -- experienced a real
       increase in their income.

      Earnings for Typical Workers Up. Last year, the earnings of the median full-time,
       year-round male rose 2.4 percent, from $32,882 in 1996 to $33,674 in 1997 and the
       earnings of the median full-time, year-round female rose 3.0 percent, from $24,254 in
       1996 to $24,973 in 1997. This means that the female-to-male ratio remained at 74
       percent -- its all-time high.

      Poverty Rate Fell To 13.3 Percent in 1997 -- Down from 15.1 Percent in 1993. In 1997, the
       poverty rate dropped to 13.3 percent from 13.7 percent the year before. Since President
       Clinton signed his Economic Plan into law, the poverty rate has declined from 15.1 percent in
       1993 to 13.3 percent last year. That means that there are 3.7 million fewer people in poverty
       today than in 1993. (In 1997, the poverty threshold was $16,400 for a family of four.)

       The African-American Poverty Rate Down To Its Lowest Level on Record. While the
       African-American poverty rate is still far above the poverty rate for whites, it declined
       from 28.4 percent in 1996 to 26.5 percent in 1997 -- that's its lowest level recorded since
       data were first collected in 1959. Since 1993, the African-American poverty rate has
       dropped from 33.1 percent to 26.5 percent -- that's the largest four-year drop in
       African-American poverty in more than a quarter century (1967-1971).

      Last Year, Largest Hispanic Poverty Drop In Two Decades. Last year, the Hispanic
       poverty rate dropped from 29.4 percent to 27.1 percent -- that's the largest one-year drop
       in Hispanic poverty since 1978. While there is still more work to do, since President
       Clinton took office, Hispanic poverty has dropped from 30.6 percent to 27.1 percent.

       Under President Clinton, Largest Four-Year Drop in Child Poverty Since 1960s. While the
       child poverty rate remains high, in 1997, it declined from 20.5 percent to 19.9 percent.
       Under President Clinton, the child poverty rate has declined from 22.7 percent to 19.9
       percent -- that's the biggest four-year drop in nearly 30 years (1965-1969).

      Elderly Poverty Rate As Low As It's Ever Been.     In 1997, the elderly poverty rate dropped
       to 10.5 percent, from 10.8 percent in 1996.      The elderly poverty rate is now as low as it's
       ever been -- it was also 10.5 percent in 1995.

       Child Poverty Among African-Americans Down To Lowest Level on Record. In 1997, the
       African-American child poverty rate fell from 39.9 percent to 37.2 percent -- its lowest level on
       record (data collected since 1959). Since 1993, the child poverty rate among
       African-Americans has dropped from 46.1 percent to 37.2 percent -- that's the biggest
       four-year drop on record.

       Hispanic Child Poverty Dropped More Last Year Than Any Year on Record. In 1997, the
        Hispanic child poverty rate dropped from 40.3 percent to 36.8 percent -- that's the largest
        one-year drop on record (data collected since 1976). Since 1993, the child poverty rate
        among Hispanics has declined from 40.9 percent to 36.8 percent.

       4.3 Million People Lifted Out of Poverty By EITC -- Double The Number in 1993.          In 1993,

low-income working families. In 1997, the EITe lifted 4.3 million people out of poverty --
that's double the number of people lifted out of poverty by the EITe in 1993. In 1997, the
EITe lifted 2.2 million children, 1.1 million Mrican-Americans, and nearly 1.2 million
Hispanics out of poverty.
