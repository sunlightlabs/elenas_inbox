TEXT:
I've been working with Chuck Marr and Bob Shireman on the Labor/HHS event
for Monday.  Attached is a draft of the paper we've put together.   It is
essentially a brief, state-by-state version of the paper we put out
earlier this week; we've used state level numbers where we have them, and
national numbers where we don't.

We are trying to get the paper done today, in part because each of us is
gone for the weekend.  Its not entirely clear if this is to be a DPC or an
NEC event, so the review/clearance procedures for the paper aren't clear
either.   I thought you ought to see this, though there is little new in
it.

Finally, I've sent Chuck the following edit on the class size bullet at
the end of the attached paper:

$X to Y to help reduce class size in the early grades and give students
personal attention and a
strong foundation in the basic skills.

Subject:         revised template draft

Here is a revised draft of the template.    PIs send comments/clearance ASAP.

PIs take a look specifically at the heading on the bottom for class
size/school modernization.  (we want to criticize them but not imply
proposals are dead)  Thoughts?

Congress Retreats from Support for Education and Youth
Republicans in the House of Representatives are advancing a bill that denies educational and training
opportunities to the young people ofX. The House Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill, which will soon
be voted on, cuts $3.3 billion from the President's education and training priorities.
The House Republican Bill:
     Eliminates the $871 million Summer Jobs program. X disadvantaged young people in Y would be
     denied the opportunity to gain skills and valuable work experience over the summer months. Studies
     show that the Summer Jobs initiative works. A 1995 report concluded that more than three out of
     four young people enrolled in the program would have been jobless without it, especially 14-15 year
     olds.
     Retreats from the nation's commitment to raise academic standards. President Clinton has proposed
     to help states, local communities and schools raise academic standards through the development of
     voluntary national tests in the basic skills, and through the Goals 2000 program. The House bill denies
     6,000 schools nationwide funds to help students reach high standards and would halt development of
     voluntary national tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math.
     Cuts Head Start. Denies slots to X low income children in Y.
    Eliminates funds for reading tutors. The House bill eliminates $260 million for the America Reads
     Challenge, denying funding to schools and communities to improve reading programs and provide tutors to
     students who them.
     Denies funds for after-school programs. The House bill reduces the President's request for the 21 st
     Century Community Learning Centers program by $140 million, denying approximately 425,000 school-age
     children participation in before- and after-school programs.
   Denies disadvantaged students help in the basic skills. The House bill denies funds to help an additional
    X educationally disadvantaged students in Y master the basic skills, by cutting the President's request for
    Title 1 by almost $400 million.
     Slows progress in putting computers in the classroom. The House bill denies funding to 400 school
     districts nationwide to provide students and teachers with access to computers and deny specialized
     technology training to a large number of new teachers first entering the classroom.
     Eliminates funding to prepare disadvantaged children for college. The House bill denies more than
     one million (over 5 years) at-risk middle school students the mentoring and tutoring to raise education
     expectations, and eliminate barriers to college, by denying $140 million for the High Hopes program.
   Eliminates funding for middle school safety coordinators. The House bill denies 6,500 middle schools
    throughout the nation with $50 million that would provide full-time Safe and Drug-Free Schools
    Coordinators.
   Eliminates Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP).              X low-income families in Y will be
    denied help to pay for home energy costs.

RepUblicans in Congress have ignored the President's proposed investments in
modernized schools and smaller classes. Congressional inaction will deny:
    $X in bonds to Y to help rebuild, modernize, and build new schools in the state.   Automated Records Management System
