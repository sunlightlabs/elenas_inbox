       PRESIDENT CLINTON'S CLIMATE CHANGE PROPOSAL
                                          October 22,1997

        Global climate change is the premier environmental challenge and opportunity of the 21st
century, and the risks it poses justify sensible preventive steps_ A ddressing this issue is one of the
 United States' greatest imperatives, for this andfuiure generations. Recognizing the solid
foundation of climate science, President Clinton is committed to strong and sensible action to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions - including realistic and binding emissions targets.

 Key elements of President Clinton's climate change proposal include:

        Binding Targets to Reach 1990 Emissions Levels by 2008-2012 and Reductions
         Below 1990 Levels in the 5-Year Period That Follows. A critical component of
         the President's comprehensive framework is a realistic, achievable, and binding
         target of reducing greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 2008-2012 and
         reductions below 1990 levels in the 5-year period that follows.

       $5 Billion Program of Tax Cuts and R&D for New Technologies. To spur energy
        efficiency and the development of new technologies, the President proposes a
        major new package of tax cuts and R&D spending amounting to $5 billion over
        five years.

        Industry-by-Industry Consultations and Early Credit. The Administration
         challenges key industries to prepare plans over the next 9 months on how they can
         best reduce emissions. To provide an incentive for near-term actions to cut
         emissions, the President is committed to ensuring appropriate rewards for firms
         that act early.

        Developing Countries Must Participate. Climate change is a global problem, and
         requires a global solution. That's why the United States has spear-headed joint
         implementation projects, and the President has committed that the United States
         will not adopt binding obligations without developing country participation.

        Broad-Based Domestic and International Emissions Trading System Begins
         After A Decade of Experience Has Accumulated. The president is committed to
         a market-based emissions trading system, both domestically and internationally,
         that will harness the power of the market to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by
         2008-2012. The trading system would begin after a decade's worth of experience
         with tax incentives, R&D, early credit, electricity restructuring, Federal efforts,
         and other measures.

BINDING TARGETS: The U.S. binding target is realistic: It seeks to return U.S. emissions to
1990 levels in the period 2008-2012 and reduce them further thereafter. We reject the
European proposal for more stringent early reductions, as well as the "do-nothing" approach of
some interests. The target is achievable: By providing incentives for early action to reduce
emissions, attacking domestic energy inefficiencies, and putting in place a market-based
emissions trading system, we can reach 1990 levels in the proposed time frame with minimal
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
economic costs. And it is meaningful: Achieving 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012 would
amount to almost a 30percent reduction off a business-as-usual path, an important first step on
the road toward stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
SOLID PRINCIPLES: The President's five climate change principles include: that the policies
should be guided by science, rely on market-based, common-sense tools, that we should seek
win-win solutions, that global participation is essential to addressing the global problem of climate
change, and that we must have regular common-sense reviews of the economics and science of climate
change.

SOUND AND SENSIBLE THREE-STAGE APPROACH: Reflecting his five key principles, the
President's plan includes three stages: Stage 1 includes priming the pump through programs such as
R&D, tax incentives, incentives for early action, and Federal leadership, and industry consultations.
Stage 2 builds upon the first stage by including a review and evaluation in preparation for the permit
trading system. Stage 3 -- which does not occur for a decade -- involves meeting binding targets
through a domestic and international emissions trading program. The President is committed to
working with labor and Congress to insure that we give proper assistance to any workers
dislocated by the changes in energy usage inherent in any cli~ate change plan.

INITIAL ACTION PLAN: The President's immediate action plan includes 9 elements:

1. $5 Billion in Tax Cuts and Federal R&D: To spur energy efficiency and encourage the
development and deployment of lower-carbon energy sources, the Administration supports a
major new package of tax cuts and R&D spending amounting to $5 billion over five years.

2. Credit for Early Action: To provide an immediate incentive for near-term acti~ns, the President
is committed to ensuring that firms acting early are rewarded appropriately.

3. Industry-by-Industry Consultatio!'s: The Administration challenges key industry sectors to
prepare plans over the next 9 months on how they can best reduce emissions.

4. Encouraging the Use of Energy-Efficient Products: The President will comple~ent his tax
incentives, commitment to early action credit, and industry consultations by engaging in a
broad-based effort to expand the use of existing energy-efficient technologies.

5. Federal Procurement and Energy Use: The Department of Energy will spearhead a
comprehensive effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Federal sources.

6. Electricity Restructuring: To deliver a significant downpayment on en;lission reductions, while
saving consumers billions, we will pursue a bold plan for electricity restructuring.

7. Setting a Concentration Goal: The United States supports developing a specific, long-term
concentration goal with the assistance of the National Academy of Sciences and other bodies.

8. Bilateral Dialogues: In addition to pursuing agreement in Kyoto, the Administration will
pursue bilateral dialogues with key developing countries to promote clean energy.

9. Economics and Science Reviews: The President proposes regular scientific and economic
reviews. These reviews will ensure that policy-makers have the best possible information on climate
change.

WIN-WIN: There are numerous win-win solutions to reducing ca:bon emissions. For example, a
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
breakthrough in fuel cell technology announced yesterday will clear the way toward developing cars
that are three times as efficient as today's models -- cutting pollution while also cutting driving costs.
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
                       INITIAL CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS
                                            October 22, 1997

President Clinton has proposed nine immediate actions to begin addressing climate change:

1. Tax Cuts and Federal R&D: To spur energy efficiency and the development of lower-carbon
energy sources, the Administration supports a major new package of tax cuts and R&D spending
amounting to $5 billion over five years. Many of the ideas from the recent report of the
President's Committee on Science and Technology (PCAST) will be considered in constructing
this package.

2. Credit for Early Action: To provide an immediate incentive for near-term actions to cut
emissions, the Administration is committed to ensuring that firms which act early are rewarded
appropriately. We will work with companies to build a program that appropriately rewards
those who take prompt and early actions before the beginning of the mandatory emissions
budget period in Stage 3.

3. Industry-by-Industry Consultations: The Administration challenges key industry sectors to
prepare plans over the next 9 months on how they can best reduce emissions, including how the
Federal government can remove regulatory hurdles that discourage energy efficiency. The
Administration will work in partnership with industry to develop sensible efficiency standards in
a variety of areas.

4. Encouraging the Use ofEnergy-Efficient Products: As the Department of Energy's 5-Labs
study illustrates, many existing technologies produce win-win solutions to reducing carbon
emissions - but nonetheless are still not widely used. The President is committed to expanding
their reach. He will therefore complement his other programs by engaging in a broad-based
effort to expand the use of existing energy-efficient technologies - while also spurring the
development of new technologies.

5. Federal Procurement and Energy Use: To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Federal
sources, DOE will spearhead a comprehensive effort that includes expanded performance
contracting to make Federal buildings more energy-efficient, improved Federal procurement of
energy-efficient technology, and partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of Federal aircraft, ships
and vehicles. Federal agencies will also be called upon to assess emissions in major initiatives.

6. Electricity Restructuring: To spur further efforts to clean our air and deliver a downpayment
on greenhouse gas emission reductions, while saving consumers billions, we will pursue a bold
plan to restructure the energy sector. It is time to change the rules that are often more than 70
years old - stifling innovations that can save money and impede newer, cleaner technologies.

7. Setting a Concentration. Goal for Greenhouse Gases in the Atmosphere: The goal of the existing
climate treaty is to stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gases, but the specific concentration has never
been defined. The u.S. supports developing a specific, long-term goal, with the assistance of the
National Academy of Science and other appropriate bodies.

8. Bilateral Dialogues: In addition to pursuing agreement in Kyoto, the Administration will
pursue bilateral dialogues with key developing countries to promote clean energy.
                                                                       f lex-Dump Conversion
9. Economics and Science Reviews: The President proposes regular scientific and economic
reviews, to ensure that policy-makers have the best possible information on climate change.

          PRESIDENT CLINTON'S FIVE CLIMATE CHANGE PRINCIPLES
                                              October 22, 1997

    Global climate change is the premier environmental challenge and opportunity of the 21st
    century, and th( risks it poses justify sensible preventive steps. Addressing this issue is one
    of the United States' greatest imperatives,for this andfuture generations. Recognizing the
    solid foundation of climate science, President Clinton is committed to strong and sensible
    action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - including realistic and binding emissions
    targets.

President Clinton's climate change plan is based on five key principles:

         Guided by sCience. The vast majority of the world's scientists have concluded that if the
          countries of world do not work together to cut greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures will rise
          and disrupt the global climate. Indeed, most scientists say this process has already begun. But
          there is much we still don't know about how the climate and human health will react to
          increased greenhouse gas concentrations. That's why the President's plan includes regular
          science reviews, to ensure that our policies are guided by the best science available.

         Market-based, common-sense tools. We have learned that the costs of protecting the
          environment is substantially lower if we harness the power of markets to do so. That's why
          the President's plan emphasizes flexible and market-based mechanisms. His plan includes a
          domestic and international permit trading system for greenhouse gas emissions, similar to the
          highly successful permit trading system that has dramatically cut acid rain at a fraction of the
          predicted cost.

         Seek win-win solutions. There are a multitude of win-win solutions to reducing carbon
          emissions, that can improve our energy efficiency and save consumers money. For example, a
          breakthrough in fuel cell technology announced yesterday will clear the way toward developing
          cars that are twice as efficient as today's models -- cutting pollution while also cutting driving
          costs. The President believes that we must seek such win-win solutions to addressing climate
          change.

         Global participation. Climate change is a global problem, and requires a global solution. A
          ton of carbon emitted in Argentina has just as much effect on the global climate as.a ton of
          carbon emitted in the United States -- and within the next few decades, emissions from
          developing countries are expected to exceed those from developed countries. And many
          win-win opportunities exist to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries.
          That's why the United States has spear-headed joint implementation projects and the President
          has. committed that the United States will not adopt binding obligations without developing
          country participation.

         Common-sense economic reviews. Our knowledge of the challenges and opportunities we
          face will grow over time. Therefore, the President is calling for regular 5-year economic
          reviews and updates, to ensure that policy-makers, both in the Administration and in Congress,
          have the best possible infonnation on how the economy is responding to the effort to address
          climate change, how other countries are perfonning relative to their own commitments, and
       how the climate is changing in response to human activities.           Hex-Dump Conversion
      THE PRESIDENT'S THREE-STAGE PLAN ON CLIMATE CHANGE
                                           October 22, 1997

       Reflecting his five key principles, the President's plan will proceed in three stages:

      Stage 1: Priming the Pump Through R&D, Tax Incentives, Incentives for Early Action,
       Federal Leadership, and Industry Consultations. The first stage of the President's package
       includes a 9-point action plan -- including $5 billion in tax i~centives and spending for R&D
       and energy efficiency, incentives for early action, a set of Federal government energy
       initiatives, and industry-by-industry consultations to explore their best ideas on how to reduce
       emissions in acost~effective manner (including market-oriented standards for energy
       efficiency). The first economic review would occur near the end of Stage 1.

      Stage 2: Review and Evaluation. The second stage, which would begin around 2004, will
       build upon the programs adopted in Stage 1, by including a review of our progress and an
       evaluation of next steps as we move toward a market-based permit trading system for carbon
       emissions. During this second stage, the details of the permit system would be refined and
       perhaps tested. Such a perinit system is similar in concept to the one that dramatically cut acid
       rain emissions -- although the scale would be significantly larger than the current acid rain
       program. The second economic review would occur near the end of Stage 2.

      Stage 3: Meeting Binding Targets Through Domestic and International Emissions
       Trading Program. In the third stage, we would reduce emissions to 1990 levels by
       2008-2012, and below 1990 levels in the 5-year period after that, through a market-based
       domestic and international emissions trading system. Before beginning this third stage, the
       second economic update and review would allow Congress and the President to evaluate how
       the economy had responded to a decade's worth of experience in the first two stages of the
       President's plan. The President is committed to working with labor and Congress to insure
       that we give proper assistance to any workers dislocated by the changes in energy usage
       inherent in any climate change plan.

This three-stage program recognizes the long-term nature of the effort to address climate change in
three ways:

             By adopting a graduated approach to emissions reductions, it allows us to exploit the
              tremendous opportunities for win-win reductions first.

             By adopting a system of regular scientific and economic updates and reviews, it allows
              us to monitor our progress and re-assess our success in reducing emissions, the state of
              scientific knowledge, and how the economy is responding to our efforts. Only after we
              have accumulated ten years of experience with the first two stages of the program would
              we enter the internationally binding period.

             By insisting that the United States will not adopt binding obligations without developing
              country participation and by emphasizing the importance of an international trading
              system and joint implementation, we take advantage of low-cost reduction possibilities
              wherever they occur -- either here or abroad.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
  COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE, SENSIBLE ACTION
                                            October 22, 1997

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGET

Under the current internatio.nal climate change agreement (signed in Rio. de Janeiro. in 1992),
industrialized co.untries accepted a no.n-binding emissio.ns reductio.n go.aL Mo.st natio.ns, including
the United States, will fall sho.rt o.f meeting it. This fact, co.upled with better scientific evidence o.n
the serio.usness o.f the climate change threat, led the U.S. to. pro.po.se last year that a new agreement
set binding limits o.n emissio.ns. The pro.po.sed U.S. emissio.ns target is designed to. pro.vide
impo.rtant enviro.nmental gains while maintaining stro.ng eco.no.mic gro.wth. It is:

       Realistic. Seeks to return U.S. emissions to 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012 and
       reduce them further thereafter. Rejects European proposal for more stringent early
       reductions, as well as the "do-nothing" approach of some interests.

       Achievable. By providing incentives for early. action to reduce eDllsslOns, attacking
       domestic energy inefficiencies, securing flexible international implementation
       mechanisms, and putting in place a market-based domestic emissions trading system, the
       U.S. can reach 1990 levels in the proposed time frame with minimal economic costs.

       Meaningful. Achieving 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012 would amount to almost a 30
       percent reduction off a business-as-usual path, an important first step on the road toward
       stabilizing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Emissions accounting
       will include all greenhouse gas sources and sinks (including reforestation).

FLEXIBLE, MARKET-BASED IMPLEMENTATION

Just as the effects o.f climate change will be felt glo.bally, so. to.o. are the causes o.f climate change
glo.bal in nature. Greenho.use gas emissio.ns do. equal harm to. the atmo.sphere whether they co.me
fro.m a co.al plant in China Dr a bus in Bo.sto.n. Fo.r this reaso.n, any regime to. reduce greenho.use
gases must be glo.baL It must also. allo.w all natio.ns the ability to. seek out the mo.st efficient way o.f
 reducing emissio.ns so. that the greatest gains are achieved at the least co.st. Fo.r these reaso.ns, the
 United States stro.ngly suppo.rts the inclusio.n in a new climate change agreement o.f two. inno.vative,
flexible mechanisms fo.r reducing emissio.ns:

       International Emissions Trading -Using Markets to Lower Costs. The principle of
       emissions trading is to use the efficiency of the market place to achieve environmental
       objectives at the lowest possible cost. Under an international emissions trading regime, a
       country (or firm) would be able to meet its emissions reduction target by reducing
       pollution itself, purchasing reductions from another country (or firm) that was able to
       achieve excess gains, or some combination of both.

       Joint Implementation --A Global Solution to Low-Cost Reductions.                   Joint
       Implementation (JI) is an innovative, market-based approach for addressing global
       climate change that uses international partnerships to achieve low-cost reductions in
       greenhouse gas emissions. Under JI, a company in the United States invests in a project
       which reduces emissions in another country and uses those reductions as a less expensive
                                                                        lkx-D\.lmp   Conversion
PARTICIPATION OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

In addition to its non-binding emissions reduction aim for developed countries, the Rio climate
change agreement required all countries to take policies and measures to reduce emissions. Many
developing countries have made real strides, through, for example, reducing energy subsidies.
Nevertheless, given that developing country emissions will eclipse those from the developed world
within several decades, these countries need to do more. Accordingly, the U.S. calls on developing
countries to strengthen their existing commitments and to agree that their obligations must increase
over time to include binding emissions limits. Our principles include:

       Global Participation. All countries must participate. Every nation would be required to
       take meaningful actions to limit emissions. The U.S. will not assume binding obligations
       until developing countries agree to participate meaningfully in the challenge of addressing
       climate change.

       Equity. The obligations of poorer and less developed countries should take into account
       their state of economic development and their relative contribution to the climate change
       problem.

       Assistance. While insisting th~t developing countries take meaningful actions to address
       climate change, the U.S. recognizes that many of these countries face significant
       development,challenges that hamper their ability to reduce emissions. President Clinton
       is reemphasizing his commitment to working with these nations to help build more
       sustainable energy futures. This includes a $1 billion package of assistance from USAID
       and a renewed commitment to provide fmancial assistance through the Global
       Environment Facility, as well as our pathbreaking joint implementation proposals.

 Description

        The principle of emissions trading is to use the efficiency of the market place to achieve
 environmental objectives at the lowest possible cost. Under an international emissions trading
 regime, a country (or fIrm) would be able to meet its emissions reduction target by reducing
 pollution itself, purchasing reductions from another country (or fIrm) that was able to achieve
 excess gains, or some combination of both.

        Given an effective international regime, emissions trading provides a powerful incentive
 for nations to reduce below the amount required and then sell excess reductions to others who in
 tum avoid more costly actions. The U.S. has proposed that emissions trading be permitted
 among all countries that agree to a binding emissions target.

 How it would work

          Consider a simplifIed example for how international emissions trading might work.
  Country A and Country B must reduce emissions by 100 tons each. It might cost each country
. $1,000 to reduce 100 tons individually for a total cost of $2,000. However, if Country A could
  reduce its emissions by 200 tons for a total cost of $1,500 and sell half of these reductions to
  Country B, the overall target would be achieved for $500 less, a savings of 25 percent.

 U.S. experience

        Emissions trading is being used successfully at the domestic level to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions (which cause acid rain) under the Clean Air Act. Achieving targeted reductions was
originally estimated to cost $5 billion annually if traditional controls had been required and $4
billion with emissions trading. A GAO estimate, after the initial stage of emissions trading now
puts the cost at $2 billion per year, or 60 percent below the original estimate with pollution
reductions signifIcantly ahcad of schedule. Emissions trading has also been successful in cutting
the costs of phasing out leaded gasoline and in curbing the production of chlorofluorocarbons
which deplete the ozone layer.

  Cost savings

        According to the 1997 Economic Report of the President, international emissions trading
 for carbon dioxide could lower the cost of reductions by 50 percent below the minimum          '
 achievable using purely domestic programs.

Description

       Joint Implementation (JI) is an innovative, market-based approach for addressing global
climate change that uses international partnerships to achieve low-cost reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions. Under JI, a company in the United States invests in a project which reduces
emissions in another country and uses those reductions as a less expensive means of meeting its
own target. TheU.S. has proposed that a formal regime that gives credit for JI projects be part
of a new climate change agreement.

How it would work

       Consider the example of a project announced today as part of a pilot program on joint
implementation instituted by the United States. Two U.S. companies (Solar Electric Power and
                                              .                               .
Light of Washington, D.C. and Trexler and Associates, Inc of Oak Grove, Illionois) will work
with Renewable Energy Services Company of Asia, Ltd. to market and' install 812,000 solar
home systems in Sri Lanka. These systems will replace the use of kerosene lamps for lighting and
the use of diesel-electric charging of lead-acid batteries for powering small home appliances.
The result will be a 1.5 million metric ton reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and cleaner
energy for tens of thousands of people.

U.S. experience

       Under the U.S. pilot program on JI (formed under the existing climate change
convention), 28 projects have been approved in 12 countries, including Costa Rica, Bolivia, the
Czech Republic, and Russia. These projects span a range of technologies, including solar,
geothermal, and wind power; fuel switching for district heating; biomass energy; and
reforestation. U.S. companies and organizations already participating include Commonwealth
Edison, Wisconsin Electric Power, Kenetech Windpower, Sealweld Corp., American Electric
PO'Yer, PacificCorp, Detroit Edison, Clean Air Coalition, and many others.

Benefits

Lower costs: JI provides a strong incentive for companies and countries to search the globe for
the lowest cost ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Expanded exports of U.S. technology: The enormous potential for JI projects around the world
creates major opportunities for the increased sale of U.S. energy efficiency and alternative
energy technologies.

Technolo!!V transfer: Increased reliance on more energy efficient technologies and less
carbon-intensive energy alternatives will help developing countries meet their growing energy
needs with more environmentally sustainable solutions.

               FACT SHEET ON ELECTRICITY RESTRUCTURING
                                        October 22, 1997

As part of his climate change initiative, President Clinton announced his support for appropriately
crafted electricity restructuring legislation that will save consumers billions of dollars while
reducing carbon emissions.

Description

       The electricity sector is our nation's most capital intensive industry - and has sales of
over $200 billion.      Under electricity restructuring, competition would be the primary
mechanism to set electricity generation prices. Utilities would open up their distribution and
transmission wires to all qualified sellers. The transmission and distribution of electricity would
continue to be regulated because they will remain monopolies for the foreseeable future. The
system would be restructured, not deregulated. Done correctly, this process can save consumers
in their utility bills and reduce carbon emissions. A properly structured retail competition
system can deliver electricity more efficiently, and just as reliably, as our present system of
regulated monopolies.

Cost savings

       Most experts are confident that restructuring will reduce the cost of electricity, although
there is a diversity of views over the potential size of the savings. Because the industry is so
large, even modest savings represent billions of dollars. DOE economists estimate potential
savings of $20 billion a year, which would mean average direct savings of about $100 a year to a
typical family of four and indirect savings to such a family through lower cost goods and services
of about another $100 a year. Other studies predict far larger savings.

Carbon reductions

       With appropriate market-based provISIons, electricity restructuring legislation could
reduce carbon emissions by creating incentives to produce and use electricity more efficiently
and with less pollution. As emphasized at the White House Conference on Climate Change,
two-thirds of the energy used to produce electricity is currently wasted. Restructuring should
introduce incentives for reducing this waste heat. Restructuring legislation could also include
other provisions -- such as various incentives and mandates to promote energy efficiency and
renewable energy -- that offer potential carbon savings.

Next steps

      The Administration looks forward to working with interested parties on crafting
comprehensive electricity restructuring legislation.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

              FACT SHEET ON FEDERAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT
                                        October 22, 1997

      ~ggressive    energy management can substantially reduce carbon enusslons from the
activities of the Federal government, which has the nation's largest energy bill at almost $8
billion per year. Significant strides have already been made -energy consumption per square
foot in Federal buildings is down 15 percent and energy use in civilian and military vehicles is
down about 27 percent from 1985 levels. However, we can do much more.

       The initiatives below will reduce Federal emissions of greenhouse gases through enhanced
focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy. They address areas which can deliver the
greatest energy savings, best leverage private sector funding and improve the Federal
procurement system.

1. Expand Energy Savings Performance Contracting

     Expand use of Energy Savings Performance Contracts. ESPC uses private investment capital
      and expertise to accomplish energy and cost saving projects in Federal facilities. When a
      private sector finn which has invested in federal energy efficiency improvements is fully repaid
      from its share of the delivered savings, all additional savings accrue to the government.
      Streamlined ESPC contracts put in place by DOD and DOE are beginning to speed large
      investments in energy projects at Federal facilities. However, use of ESPC's is still limited in
      the Federal government. The Office of Management and Budget will lead an effort to increase
      their use. It will include new policy and budget guidance for agencies. ESPC authority can
      also be extended to other areas including:

     Leased Federal buildings. These include buildings where the Government either pays for the
      energy use. directly or In other building where ESPC can provide a better lease for the
      Government.

     Federal mobility. There may be great potential for energy savings from more efficient energy
      use in aircraft, ships and vehicles.

      Water conservation. Water conservation projects save energy because each gallon contains
       energy from pumping, heating, chilling or treatment.

     Non-federal facilities where the Government makes indirect payment of energy expenses:
      These include, for example, National Guard facilities which the state owns but where the
      Federal Government covers utility expenses and public housing facilities which are Federally
      supported but owned by public housing authorities.

      State and local government facilities. Federal energy experts can help transfer ESPC
       techniques to state and local governments so they can access this important approach to energy
       efficiency.

2. Improve Federal Procurement of Energy Efficient Technology

      Accelerate the development of Product Energy Efficiency Recommendations.          These cover
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
       products that are in the top 25 percent of their class for energy efficiency or have Energy Star
       ratings, for example electric motors and air conditioning chillers. They provide a guide to
       Federal purchasers ofthe energy efficiency level to request in a specification or procurement.

     Establish as standard practice, the purchase of energy efficient products for Government use.
      Traditionally, federal purchases have been based on lowest price, ignoring the substantial
      savings many energy efficient products can achieve over their life. The Executive Office of the
      President will lead an interagency team to streamline and update Executive Orders and
      procurement practices to encourage the acquisition of these products. Use of alternative
      contracting vehicles to acquire energy-efficient products will be encouraged, and purchase of
      products in the top 25 percent of class for energy efficiency or conforming to Energy Star
      standards will become standard practice, subject to necessary exceptions. The initiative will be
      augmented by publication of a "best practices" buying guide and expanded training of
      purchasing decision-makers.                                                          .

     Use consolidated purchasing to stimulate markets and lower prices. Consolidated Federal
      purchasing can stimulate commercial markets for new and emerging products which offer
      greater energy efficiency, lower operating costs, and sales opportunities for small businesses
      that produce these products.

     Increase Federal procurement of renewable energy. In states that have implemented retail
      competition in their electricity industry, Federal facilities will work with their suppliers to
      ensure that the facilities purchase competitively supplied non-hydro renewable energy at levels
      equivalent to the percentage specified in that state's retail competition legislation.

     Report Federal Agencies' Contributions to Reduction of Carbon Emissions. This initiative
      will develop an appropriate measurement methodology to convert currently available data on
      Federal energy use to carbon emissions to aid national carbon reduction efforts.

3. Building for the 21st Century

     Establish a new level of excellence for Federal building construction and renovation that
      incorporates energy effiCiency, quality, affordability, and sustainability. By using the latest
      construction techniques and tapping the knowledge of the building community and local
      partners, agencies will work to ensure that new Federal buildings achieve energy efficiency
      increases of 30-50 percent by 2000 as compared to existing facilities. This will be
      accomplished through a ''whole building" approach that treats buildings as integrated systems
      rather than a series of independent component selections.

     Deploy solar technologies in Federal buildings. Show Federal leadership by installing solar
      photovoltaic and solar thermal systems on 20,000 Federal roofs by 2010 in support of the
      President's 'Million Solar Roof Initiative'. Utilize alternative financing methods to provide
      the rapid infusion of investment necessary to support the cost-effective installation of these
      systems.

     Expand the use of combined heat and power generation at Federal facilities. Combined heat
      and power makes greater use of the waste heat produced in the generation of electricity.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
     Use biomass fuels in Federal boilers. Biomass would come from agricultural and wood waste
      and methane from landfill and treatment plant operations.

     Expand public awareness of energy efficient technologies. By showcasing energy efficient
      and renewable energy technologies at National Parks, Federal offices, embassies, military
      bases, and other facilities the public will be more aware of their potential to reduce pollution
      and lower costs.

      Seek increased resources for civilian agency staffing to expand energy management activities
       and complete energy efficiency projects. In recent years, budgets for energy management in
     . several key agenCies have been cut by more than 80 percent. These Federal appropriations often
       provide the most cost-effective funding for Federal energy efficiency projects.

4. Improve Aircraft, Ship, and Heavy Vehicle Fuel Efficiency

      Public-Private partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of Federal aircraft, ships and
      vehicles. Energy use in Federal aircraft, ships and vehicles, predominantly in the military
      services, is responsible for 43 percent of the $8 billion Federal energy bill. This initiative
      would improve the energy efficiency of main propulsion systems, with particular
      emphasis on medium and heavy diesel engines and high performance turbine technology.
      The initiative -- designed along the lines of the Partnership for a New Generation of
      Vehicles -- would involve a partnership between Federal agencies and the private sector.
      Advances under this initiative will have significant application in commercial markets. In
      addition, the initiative will focus on near-term energy efficiency opportunities such as
      lighting retrofits on ships.

     Increase the use ofalternative fueled vehicles (AFVs) in the Federal fleet. Federal agencies
      are increasmg the use of alternative fuel vehicles which, among other things, helps reduce
      emissions of greenhouse gases. This initiative would enhance the focus of the current
      program on AFVs such as electrics, hybrid-electrics, natural gas and renewable-fueled
      vehicles.

5. Greenhouse Gas Assessments

     Federal agencies will be required to assess their greenhouse gas emissions in major actions they
      undertake.

Background: The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) is a National Research
Program conducted under the auspices ofthe National Science and Technology Council (NSTC)
Committee on Environment and Natural Resources. The NSTC is a cabinet-level council established
by President Clinton in November 1993 to coordinate Federal science and technology efforts. The
program's fundamental purpose is to increase understanding of the Earth system, and of human and
naturally induced changes in the Earth's environment, and thus provide a sound scientific basis for
decision making on global change issues. The USGCRP began as a Presidential Initiative, and was
codified by the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The overall FY 1997 USGCRP budget was $1.81
billion.                                                            /




The core program of the USGCRP is focused on four key scientific areas:

 Seasonal to Interannual Climate Variability: The development and refinement of forecasts of
seasonal and interannual climate variability, including study and prediction of the EI Nino phenomena.

 Climate Change Over Decades to Centuries: Analysis and projection of the effects oflong-term.
climate change on natural resources, public health, and socio-economic sectors.

 Changes in Ozone, UV Radiation, and Atmospheric Chemistry: Research on the causes, rate,
magnitude, and human health and ecological consequences of changes in stratospheric ozone, UV
radiation, and atmospheric chemistry.

 Changes in Land Cover and Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems: Research on the causes and
consequences ofland-cover changes, and on basic processes governing the functions and structure of
terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems.

New Research Directions: Global change research is providing the information about the changing
Earth system, and in particular, about climate change, that is needed to achieve a sustainable future.
New research efforts include:

 A National Assessment of Climate Change Impacts to aggregate information across regions and
sectors, analyze national-scale consequences, and support development of mitigation and adaptation
strategies.

 Improved Regional-scale Analyses, including regional estimates of the rate and magnitude of climate
change, analyses of the environmental and socio-economic consequences of climate change in the
context of other stresses, and integrated assessments of the implications for society and the
environment of climate change.

 Regional Workshops to examine the vulnerabilities of various regions of the United States to climate
change.

                                            October 22, 1997

       Announced at the White House on September 29,1993 by President Clinton, Vice President
Gore, and the CEOs of the domestic auto makers, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles
(PNGV) is a partnership between the U.S. Federal government (7 agencies and 20 federal laboratories )
and Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors that aims to strengthen America's competitiveness by
developing technologies for a new generation of vehicles. Its programs include research support for
over 350 automotive suppliers, universities, and small businesses.

        PNGV's long-term goal is to develop production prototypes of an attractive, affordable car that
can meet all applicable environmental and safety times and achieve up to three times the fuel efficiency
of a comparable automobile sold today. This would mean that a typical midsize car would be able to
achieve 80 mpg. The partnership also aims to (i) improve automotive manufacturing, and (ii)
introduce efficiency technologies into production vehicles as soon as they are economically justified.

       There are numerous reasons for pursuing PNGV, including:

      Environmental: Automobiles are a major contributor to atmospheric carbon dioxide, a major
       greenhouse gas. Already, concentrations of carbon dioxide are 25 percent higher than
       pre-industrial levels and are expected to double within the next century. Since the number of
       registered vehicles in the United States is expected to climb from 194 million in 1993, to as
       many as 270 million in 2010, PNGV's success is critical to any program of controlling US
       and world greenhouse gas emissions. It will also result in low cost methods for controlling the
       emissions that contribute to urban air pollution.

      Reducing   u.s. Dependence on Foreign Oil. The United States currently imports 50 percent of the
       oil we consume -- this share is expected to grow to more than 60 percent by 2010. Petroleum
       imports make up ten percent of our country's import inventory and account for a large chunk of
       the nation's trade deficit. This dependence on foreign oil makes the United States vulnerable.

PNGV Status Report The industrial partners are now in the process of selecting technologies that will
be included in concept vehicles that will be completed by the tum of the century. The federal agencies
are working to revise their research priorities to support both technologies that can be incorporated in
production prototypes for 2004 and that can be integrated into even more advanced vehicles that would
be designed in later years.

The goal of the program, while extremely ambitious, still seems possible given the advances in key
technology that have been achieved during the life of the program. These include advances in
production of low-cost, light-weight materials for the vehicle body and frame; electrical control systems,
batteries; and compact, inexpensive fuel cells -- including the new technology for using gasoline to
power fuel cells announced yesterday; and, advanced internal combustion engines for use in hybrid
vehicles.
                                             October 22, 1997               Automated Recon!s Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

THE BREAKTHROUGH: A gasoline-powered technology that would allow you to double the fuel
efficiency of a car and emit half the greenhouse gases and virtually no other air pollution. . For the first
time, gasoline was used to produce electricity from a pollution-free fuel cell, allowing the use of the
existing gasoline infrastructure. Previously, fuel cells have been powered by hydrogen or methanol,
which are less convenient for use in cars.

The Department of Energy, together with Los Alamos National Laboratory, and AD. Little, have
developed a breakthrough fuel processor, which can extract hydrogen from gasoline and other fuels
such as ethanol and natural gas. Last week, this fuel processor was combined with a fuel cell from
Plug Power to demonstrate for the first time that a fuel cell electric car could be fueled by gasoline or
ethanol. This eliminates the limited driving range and lengthy recharging times associated with electric
cars that run on batteries.

WHAT IS A FUEL CELL: The fuel cell converts the chemical energy of a fuel directly into usable
electricity and heat without combustion. Fuel cells are similar to batteries in that both produce a direct
current by means of an electrochemical process, but fuel cells can operate indefinitely as long as fuel is
supplied to them. Fuel cells can provide power for cars and other applications, such as electricity and
hot water for buildings.

The Department of Energy working. with its partners has brought down the cost of proton exchange
membrane (PEM) fuel cells by a factor of twenty in the last ten years. Continued R&D, coupled with
the economies of scale from mass production of fuel cells as they enter the marketplace, should allow
us to maintain this pace of cost reduction for another decade.

PARTNERSHIP FOR A NEW GENERATION OF VEHICLES (PNGV): The fuel cell breakthrough
was accomplished as part of President Clinton's PNGV initiative, an innovative partnership between the
government, the national laboratories, the big three automakers, and their suppliers. PNGV's goal is
to develop a family-sized vehicle with triple the fuel efficiency of today's cars, without compromising
cost or convenience.

POTENTIAL GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS: One-third of the nation's carbon dioxide
emissions comes from the transportation sector, primarily cars. Fuel cell technology alone can directly
double fuel efficiency and cut carbon dioxide emissions in half. In combination with other PNGV
advances, such as lightweight materials and regenerative breaking, fuel cells will allow a tripling of fuel
efficiency and a further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Powering the fuel cell with renewable
fuels, such as ethanol, could eliminate automotive greenhouse gas e~issions entirely in the long run.
The buildings sector also generates one-third of the nation's emissions of carbon dioxide. A building
that uses the electricity and hot water from a fuel cell fueled by natural gas would have about half of
the greenhouse gas emissions of the average building today. Plug Power expects to introduce fuel
cells for homes and other buildings in 2000 that will provide electricity for less than the current
residential rate. By 2010, fuel cells in buildings could be providing emissions savings of five million
metric tons of carbon.

What is PATH? Weare working to develop a partnership for 21 51 century housing bringing together
government and industry to develop, demonstrate and deploy housing technologies, designs and
practices that can significantly improve the quality of housing without raising the cost of construction.
The Partnership for Advancing Technologies in Housing includes government (DOE, HUD, EPA,
Labor, Commerce, FEMA, and DOD) and industry working together develop, demonstrate and deploy
housing technologies and practices so that homes can be built cheaper, more enVironmentally
sustainable, more disaster resistant, and provide a safer working environment.

PATH has a five-part approach:
 Industry-driven research on new technologies and practices
 Working with industry on pilot programs building thousands of marketable houses
 Streamlining of federal, state and local codes and regulations
 Judicious use of existing authority on standards
 Information campaign to influence consumer demand

R&D: Support more funds for accelerated research and demonstration of inexpensive, highly efficient,
highly attractive housing. Link with million solar roofs program.

Standards: The success of PATH will in some part be based on utilizing existing authorities on
standards for a select few products that have the potential for great savings. There are five
appliance/products currently under review by DoE; Clothes Washers, Ranges/Ovens, Ballasts,
Residential water heaters, transformers. Of these, the Clothes Washers and Water Heaters seem to
have greatest potential.

Creating Markets: The key to making the Partnership successful will be the ability to create markets
and consumer demands for homes that meet the PATH goals. The Partnership will work with states
and communities to help them understand the benefits of building these homes, and the opportunities it
affords the communities for economic growth. The Partnership will attempt to gain agreements
between communities that PATH homes can go through an expedited permitting process.

Education and Outreach: Marketing the benefits of these homes to consumers and to encourage
consumers to begin to ask for homes that are built to the quality level of>PATH= homes. This will
need to be an intensive campaign of getting the message out to communities, builders and developers.
This will provide incentives for more and more builders to want to build these homes.

Pilots: The pilots will play an important role in the success of PATH .. The pilot sites will begin of
developing the markets and demonstrate the feasibility of the homes. The pilot sites can also act as
training sites for builders and community leaders to learn about the benefits of the technologies and as
a classroom for training on how to use the technologies. Sites under consideration are Stapleton
Airport, Denver (Redevelopment of old airport site near downtown) and Florida (Working with the
State to link energy and environment to disaster resistance and affordability).

Regulatory Streamlining: Working with states and communities on making the code approval process
more efficient and less time consuming.
                                                                  f   lex-Dump Conversion
          FACT SHEET ON POTENTIAL INDUSTRY SECTOR SAVINGS
                                           October 22, 1997

        The industrial sector produces approximately one-third of total U.S. emissions. We can cut
emissions substantially in this sector through the right mix of tax incentives, accelerated research and
development, electricity restructuring, and environmental regulatory reinvention. According to a
recently released" report from five of the nation's energy laboratories, programs such as the ones below
can reduce emissions in the industrial sector in 2010 by 28 million metric tons even with no increase in
energy prices.

Increasing Energy Efficiency: Energy audits encourage systematic approaches to energy efficiency
that typically have high yields. Southwire Corporation, a large manufacturer of wire, rod, and cable,
cut their use of natural gas by 60 percent and cut electricity use by 40 percent per pound of product
produced. Motors consume 70 percent of industrial electricity used, and there is room for improving
their efficiency. The Greenville Tube Company, for example, increased productivity by 15 percent,
increased energy efficiency by 30 percent, reduced scrap by 15 percent, and achieved $77,000 per year
savings -- a 6 month payback -- by improving the efficiency of their motors.

Cogeneration (Combined Heat and Power): New technologies available in the industrial sector will
allow us to capture the waste heat the U.S. now throws away. With the right policies, industrial
cogeneration of natural gas or biomass could cut annual carbon emission significantly by 2010.
Advanced turbines developed by DOE with industry will be available in three years (orders are already
being taken). They have an overall efficiency of 80 percent to 90 percent, produce steam together with
low-cost electricity and significantly reduce NOx emissions. These turbines can run on natural gas or
biomass. Some industries have their own low-cost biomass feedstocks (for example, black liquor
gasification in the pulp and paper industry), which makes possible cogeneration with nearly zero
carbon emissions.

Expanding Industries o{the Future: The seven most energy-intensive industries-steel, aluminum,
petroleum refining, chemicals, pulp and paper products, glass, and metal casting-account for about 80
percent of the carbon emissions in U.S. manufacturing and more than 90 percent of the hazardous
waste. Industry, partnering with the Department of Energy, has developed long-term visions of
energy-efficient, low-polluting, highly competitive "Industries of the Future" as well as technology
roadmaps to identify an R&D and deployment pathway to achieving the vision. Visions typically

        The buildings sector also produces approximately one-third of total U.S. emissions. There is
substantial opportunity to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and the appliances in them.
Many of these technologies improve the quality of service delivered (i.e. higher quality lighting), and
have also been documented in a number of cases to improve productivity. According to a recently
released report from five of the nation's energy laboratories, programs such as the ones below can.
reduce emissions in the buildings sector in 2010 by 25 million metric tons even with no increase in
energy pnces.

Standards: Substantial carbon emissions reductions in 2010 can be achieved through existing authority
of the Department of Energy to establish market-oriented efficiency standards for appliances, such as
refrigerators and air conditioners. The Department of Energy uses a consensus-based approach in
which manufacturers, environmentalists, consumer advocates, and the states work together to develop
applicable standards.

Voluntary Programs: Significant carbon reductions in 2010 could also be achieved by expanding
voluntary programs such as the joint EPA-DOE Energy Star program. Energy Star labeling has
already transformed a number of markets. For example, it has cut the energy used by computers,
monitors,and printers by 50 percent at virtually no incremental cost. It is now being extended to
dozens of other products.

Adopting Best Electricity Engineering Practices: Electronic equipment consumes electricity in
stand-by mode (even when not being used) generating 12 MMTs of carbon emission each year.
Preliminary analysis suggests that 80 percent of that could be saved through adopting best engineering
practices without reducing service.                              .

Research and Development: Designing buildings with advanced technology can reduce energy
consumption by 25 to 50 percent without increasing the building's initial cost. The extra cost of some
of the energy-efficient equipment is offset by the smaller required heating and cooling system.

Combined Heat and Power: As in industry, we can reduce the carbon intensity of the buildings sector
by accelerating the use of combined heat and power (CHP). Two CHP technologies-small turbines
and proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells--can convert natural gas to useful energy with 80 to
90 percent efficiency, significantly cutting carbon emissions from a building.

        The transportation sector produces approximately one-third of total U.S. emissions. According
to a recently released report from five of the nation's energy laboratories, programs such as the ones
below can reduce emissions in the transportation sector in 2010 by 73 million metric tons even with no
increase in energy prices.

High Efficiency Cars And Light Trucks: The goal of the President's Partnership for a New Generation
of Vehicles is to produce cars that are three times more efficient than current vehicles with no
compromise in size, safety, comfort or cost. The objective is a production prototype vehicle with a
fuel efficiency of 80 mpg in 2004 and commercial availability soon after. A variety of efficient
technologies such as hybrid vehicle design, advanced engines, regenerative braking and lightweight
materials are under development. These technologies are also applicable to light trucks and sport
utility vehicles, so that a PNGV for these heavier passenger vehicles is quite possible with an expanded
research effort.

High efficiency heavy trucks: Ongoing federal R&D on advanced diesel engines and lightweight
materials have the potential to substantially reduce carbon emissions from heavy trucks. These
technologies are projected to be available by about 2003 and be quickly adopted by truckiI)g
manufacturers since energy is a major cost component of freight transportation (a truck typically gets 7
to 8 miles per gallon while traveling over 50,000 miles a year).

Advanced Efficient Aircraft and Rail: Ongoing federal R&D on advanced aircraft engines, improved
airframes, and air traffic control have the potential to improve aircraft energy efficiency by 35 percent,
with an additional increment of carbon emissions reductions achieved by increasing the efficiency of
trains.

Low-Carbon Fuel: Government-industry R&D partnerships have brought the cost of ethanol from
cellulosic waste (such as crop waste) and dedicated crops (such as switchgrass) from $3.60 per gallon
in 1980 to $1.20 per gallon today. Such fuels are carbon neutral because the crops capture carbon
dioxide when they grow and release it during combustion.
