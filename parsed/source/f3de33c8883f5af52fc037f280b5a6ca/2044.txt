TEXT:


The Supplemental Appropriations bill that Senate Appropriations Committee
is marking up Tuesday at 10:00 includes a $125 million block grant for
legal immigrants.  The fund is a pure block grant -- states decide who
will be helped and what benefits they'll get.  Although the committee
language claims this would provide another two months of benefits, CBO
says one month of SSI and Medicaid would cost nearly twice as much ($240
million) .

Anyway, attached is a revised version of a previous Q&A that I expect
press may need. ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

Q:       This morning, the Senate Appropriations Committee will take up a
                supplemental appropriations bill that includes $125 million for
         benefits for legal immigrants. Does the President support this?

A:       The President is glad that members of Congress and Governors and state
         legislators             and county officials and mayors -- both Republicans and
         Democrats .. are gaining a new realization of the impact of the cuts to legal
         immigrants that were wrongly included in last year's welfare reform bill. Many
         state and local officials are now looking more carefully at their budgets and the
         potential costs of assisting disabled legal immigrants, many in nursing homes,
         without federal help. There are now less than 100 days before August 1st, when
         many disabled individuals will lose their SSI and Medicaid benefits.

         Needless to say, a $125 million appropriation is a band-aid approach. Such a
         small sum would meet only a fraction of the need. Most states don't have a
         mechanism in place to distribute the funds to those in need .. it would make more
         sense to restore SSI benefits than ask states to create new bureaucracies.

         The President has put a comprehensive $14.6 billion proposal on the table that
         restores the worst cuts to legal immigrants enacted last year. We encourage the
         Republican leadership to work with us in the context of budget negotiations to
         provide medical and other vital assistance to legal immigrants who work hard, pay
         taxes and contribute to American society and fall on hard times through no fault
         of their own.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

       TODAY: PRESIDENT CLINTON EXPANDS AMERICORPS AND ISSUES
                     NATIONWIDE CALL TO SERVICE

      At the President's Summit for America's Future, President Clinton announced new
proposals to expand service and mutual responsibility nationwide:

      President Clinton announced new AmeriCorps Challenge Scholarships -- asking charities,
       religious groups, and community groups to enlist young people for a year of full-time
       service, and giving those young people AmeriCorps scholarships in return. If the private
       and non-profit sectors rise to this challenge, these scholarships would go to as many as
       50,000 young people with money that is already in the President's balanced budget.

      President Clinton challenged every state and every school system to offer young people
       the chance to serve -- to help teach them the responsibility of citizenship.

      President Clinton announced new legislation to allow any young person with a college
       loan to take a year to serve without accruing additional interest on that loan.

      President Clinton announced the expansion the Police Corps, to triple the number of
       young people who can earn four years of college by agreeing to serve at least four years as
       police officers, and challenged young people to become teachers where they are needed
       most -- in America's central cities.

        In his speech this morning, President Clinton said that "The era of big government
is over, but big challenges remain. We are here to proclaim: the era of big citizenship has
begun."                                                                           .

      The President issued a call to action to all Americans to serve our children, and to help
       teach them to serve -- not as a substitute for government, but to meet our major
       challenges as one community, working together.

      The President emphasized that even with all the progress our nation has made -- 12
       million new jobs, falling crime and welfare rolls -- we still face enormous challenges.
       But the toughest of these are challenges Of the heart -- ones that must be faced person by
       person, neighbor by neighbor, community by community. That is why restoring an ethic
       of service and mutual responsibility is so important.
