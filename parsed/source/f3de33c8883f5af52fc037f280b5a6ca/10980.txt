            White House AIDS Czar Applauds FY2000 Budget Increases

  Washington, DC - Sandra Thunnan, Director of the White House Office of National AIDS
  Policy, applauded the Administration's leadership on HIV/AIDS as reflected in its Fiscal Year
. 2000 budget proposal to Congress. "Once again, President Clinton and Vice President Gore
  have demonstrated their commitment to ending this epidemic. There are substantial increases in
  AIDS-specific programs--over $162 million--as well as several special initiatives that will be
  critical to addressing the ongoing needs of those living with HIV/AIDS," said Thurman. "These
  include support for the Jeffords-Kennedy Work Incentives Improvement Act, Patients' Bill of
  Rights, increased Medicaid coverage for immigrants, and support for long-term care. As there
  are more and more Americans living with HIV and AIDS, it is vital that our response include
  those programs that benefit the broader disability community including people with HIV/AIDS."
 "Most importantly, this Administration will continue its efforts to address HIV/AIDS in racial
 and ethnic minorities. Secretary Shalala's budget at HHS continues emergency funding for
 these efforts, announced by the President and the Secretary this past October," said Thunnan.
 Included in the budget proposal released today are the following:
    $100 million increase in the Ryan White CARE Act, which supports states and cities in
     caring for those living with HIV and AIDS;
    $35 million increase in the AIDS Drug Assistance Program to assist in providing
     life-saving treatments to people with HIVI AIDS who cannot otherwise afford them;
    $36 million increase in early intervention programs of Ryan White (Title III), with most of
     the new funding going to serve racial and ethnic minorities in furtherance of the
     Administration's efforts to address the racial disparity in HIV/AIDS;
    $15 million increase in AIDS housing at HUD, to increase housing support to states and
     urban areas most heavily impacted by AIDS through the Housing Opportunities for Persons
     With AIDS (HOPWA) program;
                                         [CONTINUED]
                                                      IIcx-Dwnp Conversion
   $10 million increase in HIV prevention and education at the CDC to initiative a "Know
    Your HN Status" campaign targeting minority populations and youth; and
   $35 million increase in AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health to enhance
    efforts to find a vaccine, a cure, and better treatments.
The President's budget proposal also includes new initiatives that will provide substantial benefit
to people living with HNIAIDS, including:
   Demonstration Program to Expand Disability Coverage, allowing States to offer health
    coverage to individuals who meet an expanded definition of disability set by the States. This
    expanded definition--an important component of the Jeffords-Kennedy Work Incentives
    Improvement Act--will include persons who have a medical conditions, such as HN or
    diabetes, that will become disabling but for the provision of Medicaid-covered services;
   Flexibility to Cover People With Disabilities: building on a provision of the 1997 Balanced
    Budget Act (BBA), this proposal will give States broad flexibility to set higher income and
    resource standards in Medicaid to encourage people with disabilities to return to work. In
    addition, Medicaid will allow States that adopt the more generous income and resource
    standards to cover individuals who no longer meet SSI and Social Security Disabled
    Insurance (SSDI) disability criteria because of medical improvement. States offering new
    options would receive grants to develop support systems that help people with
    disabilities--including those disabled by HNIAIDS-- who return to work;
   Tax Credit for Long-Term Care: will help people with chronic illness or the families with
    whom they live. People with significant long-term care needs or their care givers would
    receive a $1,000 tax credit beginning in 2000. Approximately two million people would
    benefit, at a cost of$5.5 billion
   Restored Medicaid Eligibility for Legal Immigrants to three vulnerable groups of legal
    immigrants: children; pregnant women; and disabled immigrants whose eligibility for SSI
    would also be restored. As the President has pledged, and has achieved for other groups so
    affected, this would reverse an inequity enacted in welfare reform. Over 50% of adults and
    90% of children living with HNI AIDS depend on Medicaid, making this restoration
    critically important to addressing the needs oflegal immigrants living with HNIAIDS.
   A Strong and Enforcable Patients' Bill of Rights remains a top Administration priority,
    though it is not specifically included in the FY2000 budget proposal. For those persons
    living with HNI AIDS who must interact regularly with the health care system, the key
    provisions ofthe Bill ofRights--access to specialists, coverage of emergency room services,
    continuity of care, internal and independent external appeals, and patient protections--are
    absolutely critical.
