                         PART D - NEGLECTED AND DELINQUENT

Part D of Title I of the bill would amend Part D of Title I of the ESEA, which authorizes
assistance to States and, through the States, to local agencies, to provide educational services to
children and youth who are neglected or delinquent.

        Section 141, program name. Section 141 of the bill would amend the heading of Part D
of Title I of the ESEA to read, "State Agency Programs for Children and Youth Who Are
Neglected or Delinquent". This name would more accurately reflect the bill's proposed deletion
of the authority for local programs in Subpart 2 of Part D.

       Section 142 findings; purpose; program authorized [ESEA, § 1401]. Section 142(a) ofthe
bill would update the findings in section 1401(a) of the ESEA, and shorten them to reflect the
proposed deletion of Subpart 2.

       Section 142(b) would amend the statement of purpose in section 1401(b) to reflect the
proposed deletion of Subpart 2.

        Section 142(c) would amend the statement the program's authorization in section 1401(b)
to reflect the proposed deletion of Subpart 2.

         Section 143, payments for programs under Part D [ESEA, § 1402]. Section 143 of the bill
would delete section 1402(b) of the ESEA, which requires that States retain funds generated
throughout the State under Part A of Title I (Basic Grants) on the basis of youth residing in local
correctional facilities or attending community day programs for delinquent children and youth,
and use those Part A funds for local programs under Subpart 2 of Part D. This conforms to the
bill's proposal to delete Subpart 2. Section 142 would also make other conforming amendments
to section 1402.

        Section 144, allocation offunds [ESEA, §1412]. Section 144 of the bill would make
editorial amendments to section 1412 of the ESEA, relating to the allocation of Part D sub grants
to eligible State agencies.

        Section 145, State plan and State agency applications [ESEA, § 1414]. Section 145(2)(A)
of the bill would amend section 1414(a)(2) of the Act, relating to the contents ofa State's plan,
to require the plan to provide that participating children will be held to the same challenging
academic standards, as well as given the same opportunity to learn, as they would if they were
attending local public schools. Section 145 would also correct erroneous citations in section
1414.

       Section 146, use of funds [ESEA, § 14151. Section 146 of the bill would correct an
erroneous citation in section 1415 of the ESEA, relating to the permissible use of Part D funds.

        Section 147, local agency programs [ESEA, §§ 1421-1426]. Section 147 of the bill would
repeal Subpart 2 (Local Agency Programs) of Part D and redesignate Subpart 3 (General
                                               I-D-l
                                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
Provisions) as Subpart 2. The local agency program is unduly complicated for States to
administer and does not promote effective services for children who are, or have been, neglected
or delinquent. Those services are better provided through other local, State, and Federal
programs, including other ESEA programs, such as Basic Grants under Part A.

       Section 148, program evaluations [ESEA, §14311. Section 148(1) of the bill would
amend section 1431 (a) of the ESEA, relating to the scope of evaluations under Part D, to
conform to the proposed repeal of Subpart 2.

        Section 148(2) would amend section 1431(b) to require that the multiple measures of
student progress that a State agency must use in conducting program evaluations, while
consistent with section 1414's requirement to provide participating children the same
opportunities to learn and to hold them to the same standards that would apply ifthey were
attending local public schools, must be appropriate for the students and feasible for the agency.
This modification would recognize that, for a variety of reasons, it may not be appropriate to
administer the same tests to students who are, or have been, neglected or delinquent, as are given
to children of the same age who are in traditional public schools.

        Section 148(3) of the bill would amend section 1431(c), relating to the results of
evaluations, to reflect the proposed repeal of Subpart 2.

        Section 149, definitions [ESEA, § 14321. Section 149 of the bill would delete the
definition of "at-risk youth" in paragraph (2) of section 1432, and renumber the remaining
paragraphs. The deleted tenn is used only in Subpali 2, which would be repealed.

       Section 150, conforming amendments [ESEA, §§ 14302, 14307]. Section 150 of the bill
would make conforming amendments to section 14302 and 14307 of the ESEA, to reflect the
proposed repeal of Subpart 2 of Part D of Title I of the ESEA.
