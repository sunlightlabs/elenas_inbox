                                          Qs&As


Recruiting and Retaining Teachers for High-Poverty Communities (Teaching Fellowships)

1.    Who would be eligible to receive a Teaching Fellowship?
      Eligible candidates include undergraduate and graduate students, and adults making a
      career change into teaching, such as former military personnel, education
      paraprofessionals or teacher aides desiring full teacher certification and other mid-career
      professionals interested in the teaching profession.

2.    Who would select the Teaching Fellowship recipients?
      The President's initiative will provide grants to higher education institutions, in
      partnership with local schools and others. These partnerships will be responsible for
      selecting the National Teaching Fellowship recipients and for providing other support and
      professional development to those prospective teachers who commit to teach for three
      years in undeserved urban or rural schools.

3.    Why not just give grants directly to prospective teachers? Why are grants
      distributed the NTF Partners and then to prospective teachers?
      Partnerships will be established between the higher education institutions, local schools
      and other partners which will allow for closer coordination between teacher preparation
      and the actual teaching environment. Also, scholarship recipients will participate in
      mentoring and other programs designed to provide additional professional support and
      development. New teachers will not be isolated and will have access to the best
      pedagogical practices and thinking during those first critical teaching years.

4.    How many teachers would be recruited into the profession through this program?
      The President's initiative will help recruit nearly 35,000 teachers over five years; meeting
             nearly 10% of the need for new teachers in high poverty urban and rural
      communities.

5.    This proposal only meets 10% ofthe need, is it enough?
      This is an area in which the federal government has not played a role in recent years, so
      we are moving from no effort to addressing 10% of a critical need. It is a significant
      dent in the problem, and will stimulate other efforts nationally. What we can -- and are
      doing -- is to provide funds to support the creation of innovative partnerships whose
      benefits will outlast the five-year grant program and enable us to continue to increase the
      number of new, highly-trained teachers going into high-poverty schools.

6.    What types of expenses would be covered by the National Teaching Fellowship?
      The scholarships could cover the costs of tuition, room and board, books and other
      expenses of completing the teacher preparation program -- as well as some costs of
      mentoring or additional professional development for scholarship recipients in their first
                                                                               Hey-!)ump Conversion

      two years of teaching.
7.    What happens if a National Teaching Fellowship recipient did not complete his/her
      commitment to teach for three years in a high-poverty school?
      Recipients who do not complete their three-year commitment would be required to repay
      the institution of higher education from which they received their teaching credentials.

8.    What is the funding level for the National Teaching Fellowship and how long is the
             program expected to last?
      In FY 1999 this program would be funded at a level of $35 million, increasing to at least
      $38 million in FY2003.

9.    What would happen to the current Minority Teacher Recruitment program? Is the
      Administration backing away from its commitment to improve the diversity of the
      nation's teachers?
      This administration remains strongly committed to increasing the diversity and upholding
      the quality of our Nation's teachers_ Indeed, we share the view of many experts in the
      K-12 and higher education communities that the Minority Teacher Recruitment program,
      funded at $2.2 million is not a sufficient Federal investment in recruiting and retaining a
      diverse population of high-quality teachers_ The National Teaching Fellowships will
      make an additional $35 million available to help attract teachers into undeserved areas.
      And improvement of the diversity of those teachers in high-poverty communities is a
      critical priority -- and would be undertaken by those partnerships that would be awarding
      the National Teaching Fellowships.

10.   What role would diversity play in the selection and evaluation of the Teaching
      Fellowship Partners?
      Institutions of higher learning that apply for the partnership grants would be strongly
      encouraged to increase or maintain diverse faculty and student populations_ One way
      that this can be accomplished is that special consideration will be given to those
      partnerships that include historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving
      colleges and universities and other institutions serving high-percentage minority
      populations_ Also, higher education institutions can partner with schools and other
      organizations in the community that will enable them to increase the diversity of their
      partnership_

11.   How will the effectiveness ofthe Teaching Fellowship Partners be evaluated?
      The criteria for determining the success of the Teaching Fellowship Partners would be:
      (A) an increase in the production and retention of high-quality teachers prepared to teach
      to high standards in high-poverty schools; and
      (B) an increase in the diversity of the teaching force as a result of the Partnership'S
      recruitment efforts_


12.   If you want to attract people to teach in inner cities, wouldn't it make more sense to
      just raise teacher salaries in the cities, so they can compete with suburban school
                                                                                    Hex-Dump ConveiSion

       disticts?

       More competitive salaries could help, and that is a step that local school systems should
       consider. However, salaries alone are not the issue. Teachers leave urban schools at
       high rates within the first five years of entering teaching often becuase they don't feel
       they have been well prepared for the challanges of teaching in urban schools, and lack the
       support and help they need -- from experienced, mentor teachers and from higher
       education faculty -- in the first few years as teachers. The President's proposal directly
       addresses these concerns, by strengthening the preparation of teachers, and by helping
       teacher training programs and local school systems give new teachers the support they
       need.

13. What would happen to the current Minority Teacher Recruitment program? Is the
Administration backing away from its commitment to improve the diversity of the nation's
teachers?
        Note to Mike and Elena: This is a very sensitive issue to the Black Community. The
        Minority Teacher Recruitment Program is an existing but very small ($2 million)
        program that provides fellowships to help minorities (and low income students) go into
        teaching. It is very popular with the African American community, which will be very
        upset if they believe that we are eliminating that program, even if we are replacing it
        with one thirty-five times the size. The response below is intended to underscore the
        notion that we are proposing an expansion of that program, not its elimination.
ED remains strongly committed to increasing the number of teachers of color. Indeed, ED
shares the view of many experts in the K-12 and higher education communities that the Minority
Teacher Recruitment program, funded at $2.2 million, is not a sufficient Federal investment in
recruiting and retaining a diverse population of high-quality teachers. Therefore, ED wishes to
expand its commitment to addressing this issue by making improving the diversity of teachers in
high-poverty communities a central priority of the Recruitment Partnership program. This
priority is also one of the criteria by which we would evaluate the success ofthe Recruitment
Partnerships.


Improving the Quality of Teacher Preparation (Lighthouse Teacher Training Programs)

14. Why has the Administration decided to propose providing grants to teacher training
programs that are already exemplary?
ED has selected this approach for three reasons:
       (I) there is a need to identify best practices in teacher education;
      (2) once best practices have been identified they must be widely disseminated; and
      (3) institutions of higher education and K-12 schools and school districts must be
      encouraged to work in partnership to improve teacher education.

15. Why has the Administration decided to target the preparation of teachers who will
work in high-poverty communities?
Often newly hired teachers in poor urban and rural areas are among the least prepared and most
                                                                                         Ilex-Dump Conversion ·


inadequately supported. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in
high-poverty communities 71 % of physical science students and 33% of mathematics students
are taking classes with teachers who lack even a college minor in the field. Moreover, rates of
attrition in urban districts can reach 50% in the first five years ofteaching. Improving the
recruitment, preparation, and retention of high-quality teachers in high-poverty communities is an
essential step in expanding access to quality education. In addition, identifying the best
techniques for preparing teachers for our nation's most challenging teaching assignments will
provide a foundation for excellence in the preparation of all our teachers.


16. How many lighthouse partnerships would be established?
The President's proposal will create 10-15 lighthouse institutions, with 8-15 partners each. This
will have an impact on 150 institutions of higher education, a sufficient number to have a
significant impact on the field.

17. How would the exemplary (lighthouse) teacher training institutions be selected?
The exemplary institutions would be selected by a rigorous peer review process based upon the
criteria for excellence in teacher preparation outlined in the legislation. These would include
evidence of:
         ~      alignment between the academic content taught to prospective teachers and the
                academic standards K-12 students are expected to meet -- so that the teachers will
                know the material they will be expected to teach,
                the use of standards for teaching excellence such as the National Board for
                Professional Teaching Standards, and standards for teacher education programs;
                 production of high-quality teachers for high-poverty communities;
                 strong collaboration with K-12 schools and a joint governance structure that
                includes them;
                 strong clinical programs that include support during the beginning years of
                teaching;
         ~       success in attracting a diverse student body and faculty;
         ~       cooperation between the education program and arts and sciences; and
         ~       integration of technology.
Participants in the peer review process could include experts on teacher preparation, exemplary
teachers, elementary and secondary school administrators, and faculty members from quality
teacher education programs.

18. What role would geographic distribution play in the selection process?
Although the legislation would not require one lighthouse partnership in each state, the program
would likely involve over 100 colleges and universities from various states and regions. In
addition, given the technology now available for communication, the Education Department
anticipates that each partnership could involve institutions from different areas of the country.

19. When and how would the partners be selected?
The lighthouse partnerships would be selected through a two-step process. Applicants to be lead
institutions would first be asked to submit a pre-application which would include a description of
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion ·

how they would go about selecting their partners. The most promising applicants would then be
asked to select their partners and jointly develop a more detailed final application.
20. What would be the role of K-12 schools and school districts?
Applicants would be evaluated based on the extent of cooperation between the lead institution's
teacher preparation program and K-12 schools and school districts, including the role elementary
and secondary educators play in designing and implementing the teacher education programs.
K-12 schools and school districts would also participate in the joint governance structure of the
partnerships and be eligible for grants from the governing boards. The success of the
partnerships would be evaluated based on improvement in the quality of teaching and student
performance in the participating K-12 schools.

21. What would be the role of states?
State education officials with authority over teacher licensing and preparation would be required
to be members ofthe Lighthouse Partnership governing board. Ultimately, the best practices in
teacher preparation identified through this program should help provide direction for state-level
reform of teacher education and licensing requirements.

22. How would the success of the Lighthouse Partner~hips be evaluated?
The Lighthouse Partnerships would be held accountable for documented institutional change in
the teacher education programs of the partner institutions; the production of diverse, high-quality
teachers prepared to teach to high standards of student achievement; the retention of graduates in
the teaching profession and in high-poverty schools; and most importantly, improvement in the
quality of teaching and student performance in the participating K-12 schools.



23. How wiD the President's proposal on teacher recruitment and preparation be paid
for?
This program will be included with the Department of Education's FY(( budget as a part of its
Higher Education budget proposal. Funding will be within the discretionay limits as agreed to
as a part of the balanced budget agreement.
