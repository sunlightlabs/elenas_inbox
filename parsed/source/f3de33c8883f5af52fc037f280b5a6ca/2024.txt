Option # I: Same Line, More Sunshine

This proposal would allow the state of Texas to seek proposals from private contractors to
develop plans for an integrated enrollment system for Medicaid, food stamps, and public
assistance (T ANF).

The federal government would grant the necessary federal waivers to allow the state of Texas to
implement such an integrated system only if:

      At a minimum, benefit eligibility, the appeals process, and quality control operations
       would be conducted by public sector, civil service employees; and

      After a period for public comment, the Texas state legislature enacts and the Governor
       approves legislation approving the proposed contract and seeking the necessary
       implementing waivers. The proposed contract would be required to specify the
       contractor's workforce hiring plans, include detailed and credible procedures to ensure
       the contractor adheres to federal eligibility rules, and provide authority for federal data
       collection and auditing.

The waivers would be granted for a time limited period of five to ten years.

Option #2: Same Line, Phase-In

This proposal would allow the state of Texas to seek proposals from private contractors to
develop plans for an integrated enrollment system for Medicaid, food stamps, and public
assistance (TANF).

The federal government would grant the necessary federal waivers to allow the state of Texas to
implement such an integrated system only if:

      At a minimum, benefit eligibility, the appeals process, and quality control operations
       would be conducted by public sector, civil service employees; and

      The integrated system is implemented in no more than half the offices during the first
       three years using demonstration waiver authority. At the end of three years, the federal
       government will decide whether to allow expansion of the system based on an evaluation
       of the data collected during the first two years of operation.


                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
    Option #3: Private Sector as Consultants

    This proposal would allow the state of Texas to seek proposals from private contractors to help
    the state develop an integrated enrollment system for Medicaid, food stamps, and public
    assistance (T ANF).

    The contractors would be asked to submit proposals to:

          Develop a plan for one-stop enrollment centers, including improved computer systems,
           more efficient operating procedures, and more user-friendly public information systems;
           and

          Provide administrative functions not involved in directly interacting with or determining
           the eligibility of applicants or beneficiaries.

    The selected contractor would implement the new procedures in all eligibility offices.
