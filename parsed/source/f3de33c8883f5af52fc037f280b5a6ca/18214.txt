               practices and ideas on how to start and organize after-school programs entitled
               Keeping Schools Open as Community Learning Centers. In fiscal year 1998, the

              have taken a job in another state -- reforms that became law along with other
              tough new rules as part of welfare reform. The Clinton Administration collected
              a record $12 billion in child support in 1996 through tougher enforcement, an
              increase of $4 billion, or nearly 50%, since 1992. In 1996, the number of child
              support cases with collections also rose to 4 million, an increase of 43%, from 2.8
              million in 1992. In 1996, the number of paternities established rose to nearly 1
              million, almost double, from 516,000 in 1992.

               Requiring HHS and the Us. Postal Service to implement a policy ofposting
               "Wanted Lists" in post offices ofparents who owe child support (1996). In 1997,
              the following 12 states displayed "Wanted Lists" for delinquent child support
              offenders: California, Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts,
              Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, and South

             Child Support Enforcement System Web Site (1996). Used the Internet to help
              people access the child support enforcement system more easily and effectively --
              and to help find those parents who are not paying the child support they owe. In
              1997, the Child Support Enforcement web page received over 238,000 hits.

             Supporting Families: Collecting Delinquent Child Support Obligations, Executive
              Order 13019 (September 28, 1996). Facilitated the collection of delinquent child
              support obligations from persons who may be entitled or eligible to receive certain
              federal payments or assistance. The first administrative offset was taken on June
              10, 1997. To date, 843 payments have been offset, and $186,581 has been
              collected through the Administrative Offset Program.

Child Care
             Memorandum on Improving the Quality of Child Care in the United States,
              Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense (April 17, 1997). Directed the
              Department of Defense to share the expertise and lessons learned from the
              Military Child Development Programs with Federal, State, tribal, and local
              agencies, as well as with private and nonprofit groups, that are responsible for
              providing child care. The October 15 Interim Report to the President on this
              initiative cited a variety of steps taken, including creation of a toll free
              number (1-888-CDP-3040) for civilian programs to order DOD training
              materials and training over 100 personnel to serve as speakers for the DOD
              Child Development Program Speakers' Bureau.

Protecting Children

                      child safety devices with each handgun sold.

             Memorandum on the Development 0/ a National Sexual Offender Registration
              System, Memorandum/or the Attorney General (July 25, 1996). Improved the
              safety and protection of children through creation of a national sex offender
              registry. As of December 1, 1997, 20 states, representing 44.2% of the U.S.
              population, have contributed to the national registry which now includes
              information on approximately 27,000 offenders.

Health Care
             Immunization. As a result of the President's 1993 Childhood Immunization
              Initiative, childhood immunization rates have reached an historic high. According
              to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 90 or more of America's
              toddlers in 1996 received the most critical doses of each of the routinely
              recommended vaccines -- surpassing the President's 1993 childhood vaccination
              goal.
              ~          Immunization-Child Care Initiative (July 23, 1997). Continued to
                       improve child immunization through beginning work on an integrated
                       immunization registry system so that when children change doctors, the
                       new doctor will have access to the child's immunization record. In 1997,
                       the President also announced that all children in federally-subsidized child
                       care centers are required to be immunized.

             Ending Drive-Thru Deliveries (1996). Spearheaded legislation requiring insurance
              companies to cover at least 48 hour hospital stays following most normal
              deliveries and 96 hours after a Caesarean section. [For the most part, this is being

   Ensuring the Safety ofMedications Used To Treat Children (August 13, 1997).
    Unveiled a new FDA regulation that will protect children by requiring
    manufacturers to study the safety and appropriate dosage levels of drugs for
    pediatric populations and requiring proper labeling of drugs for use in children.
    Even though many drugs affect children differently than adults, most drugs have
    not been tested on pediatric populations. Many drugs commonly given to children
     have not been tested on children including: Ritalin, and drugs for asthma, allergic
    reactions, HIV/AIDS, and ear infections. These drugs, taken together, are given
    to over five million children each year. The percentage of drugs being tested on
    children decreased by over one-third between 1991 and 1996.

   Eliminated Gag-Rules in Medicare and Medicaid (February 20, 1997). Ensured
    that Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries have the right to know all their
    treatment options by making it illegal for health plans to prohibit doctors from
    discussing options with their patients. Protected 13 million Medicaid
    beneficiaries in managed care plans -- children, people with disabilities and
    elderly Americans -- and Medicare beneficiaries in managed care plans.

   Moratorium on Home Health Providers (September 15, 1997). Placed
    moratorium on home health providers to allow HHS to enact strong new
    regulations to keep fly-by-night providers out of the system. This action was
    consistent with strong evidence that the best way to stop fraud and abuse in
    Medicare program is to prevent bad providers from entering the program. Home
    health care is the most rapidly expanding part of Medicare, with nearly 100 new
    home health providers entering Medicare each month.

   Covered Millions of Uninsured American Through Medicaid Waivers. Approved
    18 Medicaid waivers to cover more than two million previously uninsured
    Americans.

    Memorandum on Importation of RU-486, Memorandumfor the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services (January 22, 1993). Directed assessing initiatives by
    which the Department of Health and Human Services can promote the testing,
    licensing, and manufacturing in the United States of RU-486 or other
    antiprogestins. On September 18, 1996, the Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA) issued an approval letter to the Population Council for mifepristone
    (commonly referred to as RU-486), when used in combination with misoprostol,
    for the termination of early pregnancy. The Population Council has not yet
    submitted the manufacturing control or chemistry information identified as
    required in the approval letter. When the FDA receives all the information
    identified in the approval letter, it will have up to six months to make a decision
    on the application.

Child Worker Labels
            Child Worker Labels (August 1996). Because the child labor labeling programs
             are relatively recent, and definitive data on costs and benefits as well as consumer
             demand are not available, the newest report does not attempt to make quantitative
             assessments of their effectiveness.

Adoption
               Memorandum on Adoption and Alternative Placement of Children in the
               Public Child Welfare System, Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and
               Human Services, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, the
               Secretary of Commerce, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management
               (December 14, 1996). Bipartisan legislation, the Adoption and Safe Families
               Act of 1997, was based largely on the recommendations of the
               Administration's Adoption 2002 report. The legislation will help thousands
               of children waiting in foster care move more quickly into safe and permanent
               homes. The Act makes clear that the health and safety of children must be
               the paramount concerns of state child welfare services.

              Children With Special Needs. Signed the Small Business Job Protection Act of
               1996, which provides a $5,000 tax credit to families adopting children, and
               $6,000 tax credit for families adopting children with special needs. Since
               President Clinton took office, the number of children with special needs who have
               been adopted with federal adoption assistance has risen by 60%.

Teen Pregnancy
             National Strategy to Reduce Teen Pregnancy. Since 1993, President Clinton
             has supported innovative teen pregnancy strategies. The National Campaign to
             Prevent Teen Pregnancy, a private non-profit organization, was formed in
             response to the President's 1995 State of the Union. HHS-supported programs
             reach about 30% or 1,410 communities in the United States. Data shows that we
             are making progress in reducing teen pregnancy.

              American tribes nearly $300 million to support the system of 1,400 emergency
              shelters, safe homes, and related services nationwide.

Housing Opportunity
             FHA Fees. The President has cut FHA home mortgage insurance premiums four
             times. One reduction, applying to all first-time home buyers, will save home
             buyers $200 in closing costs on the average FHA mortgage of$85,000. Another
             will save first-time home buyers in central cities who participate in home
             ownership counseling an additional $200. In all, cuts approved by President
             Clinton have lowered average FHA closing costs for first-time home buyers by
             $1,200 around the country and will cut closing costs by $1,400 in central cities.
             Last year, FHA provided financing for 800,000 homeowners, many of whom were
            'first-time home buyers.
             ~        Making It Easier to Qualify for Mortgage Loans. The FHA has
                      eliminated unnecessary and overly strict requirements under its loan
                      program that made it difficult for many families to qualify for mortgage
                      loans.

             Financing. Provided financing to help 40,000 rural people buy single-family
              homes, including the construction of 14,000 homes under the Self-Help Housing
              program, in which low-income people gain "sweat equity" by participating in the
              construction oftheir own homes. USDA also financed the building of 7,900
              units of multiple-family housing. In total, USDA's Rural Housing Service
              invested more than $2.6 billion either as loans, guaranteed loans, or grants in rural
              housing last year. More than 58,000 jobs were created as a result of housing
              construction generated by USDA programs. Source: u.s. Department of Agriculture.

             Rental Assistance. Provided $540 million in rental assistance to help nearly
              40,000 rural, low-income households obtain well-built, safe housing. Fifty
              percent of the rental program beneficiaries were elderly, with average annual
              income of less than $7,300. Source: u.s. Department of Agriculture.


III.   Welfare
             Memorandum on Government Employmentfor Welfare Recipients (March 8,
             1997). In seven months, 2,229 employees have been hired off of public
             assistance by the federal government, about one-fifth of the goal of hiring 10,000
             persons by the year 2000. These numbers have not been released yet.

Food Stamp Fraud
            Anti-Fraud Program. Issuance error rates for food stamps have declined in each
             of the past three years, resulting in total savings of $660 million. In June 1997,
             the 1996 error rate dropped to 9.2% from the previous year's 9.7%, resulting in a
             single-year savings of more than $85 million for the program.

                 Pre-Authorization Screening of Retailers; Tougher텾ost-Authorization Controls;

                  Program conducted 4,627 investigations of stores, and fired or disqualified 1,584
                  retailers for program violations. Of those, 712 retailers, with redemptions of
                  $79.5 million, were identified as having engaged in trafficking, or having
                  exchanged food stamps for cash.

                  save millions of taxpayer dollars. "Operation Talon" was made possible by the
                  welfare reform law which permits local food stamp offices to release the
                  addresses of fugitive felons to law enforcement officers.

             Memorandum on Implementation of the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative
              (July 8, 1996). Traced approximately 93,477 guns from 27 communities (17
              original sites and 10 new sites) through the use of an innovative computer
              software system that examines crime gun trace information and provides law
              enforcement officers with crucial investigative leads about the sources of these
              guns. Source: Department of Treasury. Note: These numbers are updated from the
              numbers released in July 1997.

             Memorandum on Gun Dealer Licensing, Memorandumfor the Secretary of the
              Treasury (August 11, 1993) This initiative strengthened the system of licensing
              gun dealers, and assured their compliance with applicable rules. The Brady law
              and the Violent Crime Act of 1994 codified the directive and further reformed the
              gun dealer licensing system. As of December 10, 1997, the total number of
              federal firearms licensees (FFLs) is 106,997, down from 279,839 in April 1994,
              and the total number ofFFL dealers is 88,590 down from 252,799. Source:
              Department of the Treasury.

             Memorandum on Enforcing the Youth Handgun Safety Act, Memorandumfor the
              Secretary of the Treasury (June 11, 1997). A notice of proposed rulemaking
              concerning warning signs on guns and juveniles to be posted by federally licensed
              gun dealers was published in the Federal Register on August 27, 1997. Final
              regulations are being drafted and are expected to be completed in early 1998.

             Enforcing Zero Tolerancefor Guns and Other Weapons in Schools. In October
              1994, President Clinton signed into law the Gun-Free Schools Act, and issued a
              Presidential Directive later that month to enforce "zero tolerance" for guns in
              schools -- if a student brings a gun to school, that student will be expelled for a
              year. Under the President's Zero Tolerance gun policy, preliminary estimates
              show that approximately 6,000 students have been expelled for bringing weapons
              to schools, and the vast majority ofthose expulsions involved guns.

             Presidential Initiative Requiring Greater Proof of State Residency Before
              Purchasing a Firearm (March 5, 1997). Following the February 23 shooting at the
              Empire State Building, the President asked the Secretary of the Treasury to
              examine what might be done to prevent unlawful firearms purchases by aliens
              legally in the United States. ATF responded on April 21, 1997 by amending the
              firearms purchase form and related regulations to require purchasers to declare
              their citizenship status, and to require aliens to present photo identification and
              documentary evidence establishing their 90-day residence in the state of purchase.

         Ban on Chinese Assault Weapons and Ammunition. In 1994, the President used
          his authority under the Arms Export Control Act to stop the potential importation
          of millions of assault-type rifles (SKS) and high-capacity magazines.

Housing
         Memorandum on the "One Strike and You're Out" Guidelines, Memorandumfor
          the Secretary ofHousing and Urban Development (March 28, 1996). Denied
          admission to applicants and evicted tenants in public housing authorities (PHAs)
          who have engaged in illegal drug use or other criminal activities. The guidance
          pennits PHAs to institute and enforce tough rules to protect the safety of families
          living in public housing.
          ~       Of the 1,859 out of3,192 (58%) total PHAs responding to the Department
                  of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Public and Indian
                  Housing March 1997 survey, 1,392 PHAs had implemented "One Strike"
                  programs. These 1,859 PHAs completed 3,847 evictions in the six
                  months after "One Strike" took effect. [It should be noted that tliese
                  evictions did not necessarily result from PHAs' One Strike practices, and
                  no eviction statistics for prior years are available for comparison purposes.
                   The responding PHAs also reported that 19,589 people were denied
                  admission to public housing for criminal or drug-related activity in the six
                  months following enactment of One Strike. Again, these actions did not
                  necessarily result from One Strike, and no figures for comparison are
                  available.]    Source: Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Public

         Boosting Homeownership and Fighting Crime. The "Officer Next Door"
          program provides incentives for police officers to live in the communities where
          they work by offering a 50% discount on the purchase of HUD-owned
          foreclosed properties in designated revitalization areas. HUD has accepted 261
          sales contracts and closed 59 deals in HUD-held properties under this initiative.

         Zero Tolerance for Waste, Fraud, and Abuse in Housing. The "Get Tough"

          with only 15 in 1996; the debarment of 26 bad public housing officials -- a 100%
          increase over 1996; and more than 1,400 arrests for crime and drugs in public
          housing.

V.   Environment


          Saving Yellowstonefrom Mining. In August 1996, President Clinton announced
          an agreement to protect Yellowstone National Park from a proposed mine just
          outside the park which would have endangered the quality and quantity of waters
          flowing into the park.

           Memorandum Ordering Planning (with DOl) for Demonstration Transportation
          Systems in 3 Parks (April 22, 1996) On Earth Day 1996, President Clinton asked
          the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Transportation to develop a plan
          to enhance resource protection and the quality of the visitor experience in national

              parks though innovative transportation planning. Plans are in place for parks at
              Zion, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon.

              Protection of the Old Growth California Redwoods. The United States and State
              of California are acquiring the Headwaters Forest -- the largest privately held
              stand of old growth redwood trees. Together with buffer areas, the governments
              will preserve 7,500 acres of significant habitat for several endangered species,
              including the marbled murrelet and coho salmon. [Negotiations are continuing on
              the Habitat Conservation Plan.]

Toxics and Pesticides
             Memorandum on Community Right-to-Know Initiatives, Memorandumfor the
              Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Heads of
              Executive Departments and Agencies (August 8, 1995). President Clinton
              directed EPA to consider whether to add to the list of industries covered under the
              Community Right-to-Know Toxic Release Inventory reporting program. EP A
              published a final rule on May 1, 1997 which added seven industries to the list of
              industries covered under the reporting program: metal mining; coal mining;
              electric generating facilities that combust coal and oil; hazardous waste treatment
              facilities regulated under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Subtitle C;
              wholesale chemical distributors; wholesale petroleum distributors; and solvent
              recovery facilities.

             Restrictions on Pesticides. In 1993, the Clinton Administration stated its
              commitment to safer biological and reduced-risk pesticides. In 1996, President
              Clinton signed into law the Food Quality Protection Act (FQP A) which includes a
              consistent, health-based standard for pesticide residues, use of an additional safety
              factor to ensure protection of children, and revisions to the pesticide risk
              assessment process. Since FQP A was passed, EPA has registered 29 new
              pesticides, 20 of which were safer reduced-risk and biological pesticides.

             Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks,
              Executive Order 13045 (April 21, 1997). The executive order directed EPA to
              ensure that the Agency's regulatory actions address the disproportionate risks to
              children from environmental threats. In May 1997, Administrator Browner
              created the Office of Children's Health Protection. In September 1997, EPA
              hosted the first-ever national conference on "Preventable Causes of Childhood
              Cancer." In September 1997, EPA and HHS announced $10 million in joint
              funding for six research centers to examine children's environmental health
              issues. EPA has drafted regulatory guidance for the Agency to ensure adequate
              protection of children from environmental threats.

VI.    Service and Volunteerism
             Presidents' Summit for America's Future. The 1997 Summit brought together
              private sector, non-profits, and state and local government in a campaign to
              promote service. Over 150 cities and states are holding mini-summits.
                      77 organizations answered the President's challenge and offered to
                      sponsor 10,000 new AmeriCorps members. In June, the Corporation
                      approved 8,900 ofthese scholarships, ahead of a first-year plan for 5,000
                      scholarships.

              Cell Phones for Community Watch Groups. The President helped launch
               Communities on Phone Patrol (COPP) with cell phones donated by the wireless
               technology industry. One year later, in October 1997, 7,850 watch patrols had
               received almost 9,000 phones -- allowing 300,000 volunteers to use COPP phones
               to help protect 50 million Americans.

              National Service Scholarships. Awarded to over 1,600 high school students with
               outstanding records of community service. Next year, the Administration hopes
               that 10,000 high schools in the nation will participate -- almost half of all high
               schools.

              Memorandum on Public-Private Partnerships for Protection of the National
               Parks (April 26, 1996). In the past five years, the 376 National Park units have
               benefitted from hundreds of new partnerships. The National Park Service is
               aided by 93,000 volunteers, 65 cooperating associations, over 150 Friends groups
               and numerous corporate and philanthropic supporters. Overall, gifts of time and
               money are worth over $100 million to the National Parks every year.

Food Safety
               Comprehensive Food Safety. The President has implemented a comprehensive
                initiative to improve the safety of nation's food supply and detailed a $43 million
              . food safety program, including measures to improve surveillance, outbreak
                response, education, and research. Other significant actions:
                          August, 1996 -- Signed Safe Drinking Water Act ofl996. The law
                         . requires drinking water systems to protect against dangerous contaminants
                           like cryptosporidium, and gives people the right to know about
                           contaminants in their tap water.
                         July, 1996 -- Announced new regulations that modernize the nation's meat
                           and poultry inspection system for the first time in 90 years. New
                           standards help prevent E.coli bacteria contamination in meat.

        than two-thirds ofthe total pages in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs),
        from 25,000 pages to 8,000 pages.

       Improving Customer Service. SBA's PRO-Net system - an on-line service to link small
        businesses with federal procurement opportunities - has gone operational with more than
        171,000 small businesses listed on the system. SBA has created ACE-Net - an on-line
        service that links investors with emerging small businesses seeking equity investments.
        Eight non-profit operators located throughout the country are now operating the system.
        The goals are to have an operator in each of the 50 states as issues of consistency with
        state securities laws are resolved.
