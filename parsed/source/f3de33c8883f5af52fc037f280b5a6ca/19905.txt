                                        May 15,1998


           $196 billion over 25 years from the legislation will be allocated to states from a trust
            fund. These grants will be a mandatory, pennanent appropriation. Federal spending for
            new options on children's health outreach will be netted from this amount.

           50 percent of the grants may be used by states for any purpose. The remaining 50
            percent will be used for specified restricted purposes, described below.

           Options for restricted funds. States can use the restricted funds in any amount that
            they choose (except for CHIP) to add to anyone or all ofthe following options:

                   Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration grant programs
                   Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Title V program                   .
                   Child Care and Development Block Grant
                   Child welfare programs (Title IV -B)
                   Safe and Drug-Free Schools program
                   Professional Development (Eisenhower) grants
                   Match for the Children's Health Insurance Program (limited to 5 percent of
                   restricted funds)

           Each program's current matching rules will be used except for an increased Federal
            match of 80 percent for child care block grant funds above the appropriated amount.

           Supplement, not supplanting spending: Funds from the restricted portion of the grants
            may not be used as state match for Federal programs (except for CHIP). There will be a
            maintenance.of effort on a program-specific basis, that consists of:

                   95 percent of the FFY 1997 state spending on the programs listed below, trended
                   by the lower of inflation (CPI) or the Federal appropriation growth.

           Options for the use of restricted funds will be re-assessed every 5 years. An
            independent organization (e.g., General Accounting Office or National Academy of
            Sciences) will conduct evaluations and assessments of spending options every 5 years,
            and mflke recommendations on improvements.
