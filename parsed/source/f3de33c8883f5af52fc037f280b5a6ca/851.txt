MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:          JOHN HILLEY
               PETER JACOBY

RE:            ORGANIZED LABOR'S CONCERN WITH CODIFYING THE SUPREME
               COURT'S DECISION IN COMMUNICA nONS WORKERS v. BECK IN
               CAMP AIGN FINANCE REFORM LEGISLA nON

        Organized labor's high-profile participation in the last election cycle has intensified
Republican efforts to include a codification of the Supreme Court's 1988 decision in
Communications Workers v. Beck in any campaign finance reform legislation that passes
Congress. It is likely that organized labor will want to know the President's position on this
issue as soon as possible.

Background

         In 1988 the Supreme Court decided in Communications v. Beck that a union may not,
over the objections of dues-paying nonmember employees, expend funds collected from them on
activities unrelated to collective bargaining activities.

        The suit in Beck was brought by employees who chose not to become members of the
union that represented them. They specifically objected to being required to pay union dues that
were used -- in part-- for organizing, legislative lobbying, and participating in political events.
The Court found that under federal labor law, Congress authorized compulsory unionism only to
the extent necessary to ensure that those who enjoy union-negotiated benefits contribute to their
costs. As a result, the Court held that non-member employees cannot be required to contribute
to union activities "beyond those germane to collective bargaining, contract administration, and
grievance adjustment." The practical effect is that in a workplace where a union represents
non-members (i.e., a "closed" shop where every worker is not a union member), the union must
charge these non-members "agency fees" at a level below regular union dues. This reduction
reflects the percentage of a union member's dues spent on "non-representational" activities.

        Since 1988, the implementation of Beck has been controversial. Labor unions have set
up procedures to make sure that objecting employees are not required to pay for
non-representational activities but full scale efforts to inform all union members and
non-members of the rights under Beck have been spotty. Additionally, it has often proven
difficult for objecting employees to determine the exact percentage of dues that are spent on
non-representational activities. Enforcement of Beck rights ultimately falls to the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) where employees may file unfair labor practice charges against
any union. Critics charge that the. NLRB has been slow in acting on Beck cases and rather than
issuing general rules, has considered Beck issues on a case-by-case basis. The NLRB's first
decision in this area was not issued until late 1995 and it is currently under appeal. Finally, a
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

proposed rulemaking implementing Beck, which was first issued for comment in 1992, was
withdrawn in 1996 by the NLRB to allow them to consider the outcome of several pending Beck
cases.

        Since the 1988 decision, organized labor has strongly, and successfully, fought consistent
Congressional Republican efforts to implement the Beck holdings through statute. These efforts
reached their zenith in 1996 when the House considered the Republican leadership's campaign
finance reform bill which included a broad codification of Beck. The measure was ultimately
defeated, however, in part by moderate, pro-labor Republicans voting against the codification
language. Unions argue that since 1947 they have been prohibited from using dues money to
make campaign contributions. Additionally, under the Federal Elections Control Act (FECA)
union political expenditures can only be financed by voluntary contributions through political
action committees. Finally, unions are specifically allowed to use their dues to communicate
with their members "on any subject" and to conduct "non-partisan voter registration and
get-out-the-vote campaigns ... aimed at members and their families."

        In the new Congress, Republican leaders in both Houses have already gone on the
offensive. Republican campaign finance reform rhetoric now includes obligatory calls to
"codify the Beck decision", as well as references to union dues as the only source of involuntary
campaign spending. On the first day of the session, Senators Lott and Nickles introduced a
measure to codify Beck as one of the Senate Republican leadership's first bills. In the House,
Congressman Bill Thomas (R-CA), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, is considering
similar legislation. In the past, Congressional Republicans have tried to broaden the codification
of Beck to include all union members as well as the non-members represented by unions that
were addressed in the original decision. This expansive codification is expected to be the focus
of Republican leadership efforts in the current Congress.

Talking Points for Meeting with Organized Labor

      The President has declared his strong and serious commitment to passing comprehensive,
       bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation this year.

      The President has also stated that one of his core principles for campaign finance reform
       is that a bill must not favor one party over the other. Therefore any provision in the bill
       which disadvantaged one party over the other would seriously concern the President

      He understands that any campaign finance vehicle is extremely likely to attract a Beck
       codification provision. If such a provision is so broad that it would disadvantage one
       party over the other, that provision would be opposed by the White House.

      As a practical matter, it would be useful to know if there is any version oflanguage to
       codify Beck that is acceptable to the unions. It is always a better strategy to have an
       acceptable alternative to support in the face of an unacceptable provision.

      We will work closely with you at every step of the legislative process. We are aware of
                                                         A ta :l........

                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

your concerns and would like to satisfactorily address the Beck issue as this bill proceeds.
