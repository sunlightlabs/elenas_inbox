COMPLETION OF RENOVATION ON WEST WING ENTRANCE TO ROSE GARDEN:

Beginning on Friday, June 26th at 7:00pm, work will commence to complete

renovation on the West Wing entrance to the Rose Garden.  For the duration
of
this work, access to the Rose Garden via the West Wing entrance will be
available only in the event of an emergency.  The Rose Garden 'will also be
closed to tours.  We ask that staff find alternate routes between the West

                        Friday, June 26th: 7:00pm - 12:00 midnight
                        Saturday, June 27th: 6:30am - 6:30pm

Thank you for your patience in this matter.


EXCAVATION NEAR WEST WING LOBBY ENTRANCE:

Beginning on Friday, June 26th, excavation work will be performed on the
grass
area to the east of the West Wing Lobby entrance. This work will take
place to
repair a leak in the ground floor West Wing copier area.  The work will be
completed on Monday, June 29th and will not in any way affect access to
the West
Wing lobby or the steps which lead down to West Executive Avenue.

Again, thank you for your cooperation and patience.   If you have any
questions,
please feel free to contact Dan Holt at x62500.
