Act to allow for compensatory and punitive damages. The Vice President also will announce
several Administration initiatives aimed at enhancing enforcement of wage discrimination both

Memoranda of Understanding between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
and the Department of Labor to cross-train their staffs to be sensitive to potential violations of
the laws they enforce, including the Equal Pay Act, and to help the Department of Labor to

Increasing Enforcement of Wage Discrimination. The Vice President will call on Congress
to pass the legislation introduced today which strengthens current laws that prohibit wage
discrimination and provides training and outreach to help enforce these laws. The highlights of
this legislation include:

      Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act. This legislation amends the Equal Pay Act to
       allow for compensatory and punitive damages. Currently, the EPA only provides for
       liquidated damages and back pay awards.

       employers from penalizing employees for sharing information about their salaries with
       coworkers.

       EPA to conform with the general procedural rules for filing federal class actions in
       other areas of the law.

      Training, Research, Education, and Outreach. The bill requires the EEOC to
       provide training for its employees, subject to the availability of funding, on matters
       involving discrimination in the payment of wages. The bill also enhances programs
       already in place at the Department of Labor, requiring DOL to undertake research
       in the area of sex-based pay disparities; provide information on means of
       eradicating such disparities; assist State and local information and educational
       programs; recognize and promote the achievements of employers that have made
       strides to eliminate pay disparities; and convene a national summit to discuss and
                                                                                 Hex텱ump Conversion
       highlight the issue of sex-based pay disparities.

      Pay Equity Award. The bill establishes "The National Award for Pay Equity in the
       Workplace," to be administered by the Department of Labor, to recognize and

       disparities.

on the Internet; and strengthen the role of the Federal Government in hiring and retaining
qualified women. These initiatives are: .

      Increased Data Analysis on Pay Equity. The Vice President will announce an annual
       report on the pay gap by sex produced by the Department of Labor. This easy-to-access
       report will raise the national prominence of wage disparities and will highlight the issue
       every year in order to spur Americans to achieve increased gender pay equity.

      A Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) between EEOC and DOL to Cross Train.
       The Vice President will announce the development of a MOU between the EEOC and the
       Department of Labor to train each other's staff to be sensitive to potential violations of
       the statutes they enforce, including the Equal Pay Act, and to assist referrals of potential
       violations to the applicable EEOC or Labor Department office for appropriate action.

      A MOU Between EEOC and DOL to Collect Damages. This agreement will permit the
       Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contractor Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to
       serve as the EEOC's agent for purposes of collecting damages that are not otherwise
       collectible by OFCCP, including relief for intentional discrimination.

      Federal Contractor Best Practices. The Department of Labor will begin to
       publicize successful programs of federal contractors by placing them on the
       Department of Labor's web site.

      IO-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Businesses and Employees. The Department of Labor
       will place on the Internet a I O-step package that would give companies guidelines in
       order to determine whether they offer equal pay, hiring, and promotional opportunities.
       A similar checklist for employees will also be placed on the Internet.

      lO-Step Voluntary Self-Audit for Agencies. The Vice President will announce that the
       federal agencies will take the lO-step self-audit developed by the Department of Labor
       and use the results from the self-audit to monitor their efforts on equal pay.

      Guide to Recruitment and Retention of Women. The Vice President will announce
        OPM's new Guide on Recruitment and Retention of Women in the federal government
        which contains information to make agency managers aware of career opportunities for
