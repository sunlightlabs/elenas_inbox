                                 Questions and Answers
                                  December 11, 1997


Coast Guard Interdiction

Q.    How much cocaine has the Coast Guard seized?

A.    During FY97, the Coast Guard, in conjunction with other U.S. law enforcement agencies,
      seized its highest-ever total of cocaine -- 103,617 pounds. Last year's assisted seizures
      are triple the FY96 total of 28,585 pounds. Moreover, they are substantially higher than
      their previous record set in FY91 of90,335 pounds. The increase in Coast Guard
      seizures is largely the result of the success of Frontier Shield, which were kicked off last
      year.


Q.    What is an assisted seizure?

A.    It is a seizure during which Coast Guard assets participated in the operation. Many of
      our federal law enforcement agencies -- Customs, the Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement
      Agency (DEA) -- work together on drug seizure operations.


Q.    How do you know seizures are not up because the drug problem is growing?

A.    Because the other indicators of drug abuse are down. Overall drug use, what Americans
      spend on drugs, indicators of crack and methamphetamine usage are all down. Youth
      drug use seems to have stabilized. If the problem were growing these indicators would
      also be up.


Q.    How do these numbers relate to overaU seizure data?

A.    Full 1997 Federal-Wide Drug Seizure System (FDSS) data is not yet available.
      Assuming reported seizure levels remain unchanged during the FDSS "scrub," seizure
      levels are on track to meet or best prior year levels. For example, the Coast Guard and
      the Customs Services alone combined current data provides a total of 119.6 metric tons
      of cocaine seized. In 1996, all the federal agencies combined, including DEA and the
      Border Patrol, seized a total 115.3 metric tons of cocaine.


Q.    What can you tell us about reports that the DEA released the driver of a
      tractor-trailer rig loaded with over a ton of cocaine this past weekend in Texas?
A.    It is not appropriate for us to comment on this ongoing criminal investigation. Questions
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
      regarding this matter should be directed to the Department of JustIce.


Increased Department of Defense Counter-Drug Efforts

Q.    How much is the increase?

A.    The Department of Defense, under Secretary Cohen's leadership, has agreed to provide
      an additional $73 million over its original FY 99 budget request dedicated to
      counter-drug efforts. [Although this is only a $25 million increase over last year's enacted
      level, it represents a $73 million real increase due to non-recurring capital costs that
      dropped out this year's budget.]


Q.    What will the new monies fund?

A.    The funding will go toward a host of Defense's counter-drug efforts, including:

            Enhancing source country interdiction efforts, primarily in Peru, by providing
             ground-based and airborne radar detection capabilities, as well as training and
             conducting riverine interdiction programs;

            Implementing the commitments the United States made at the Barbados Summit
             to assist the Caribbean nations with maritime interdiction efforts; and,

            Working with Mexico to assist them in establishing their own interdiction
             capabilities;


Q.    How did this increase come about?

A.    As provided by statute, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy
      (ONDCP) reviewed the budget proposal of the Department of Defense to determine if the
      monies provided in the request adequately met the goals of the President's National Drug
      Control Strategy. ONDCP determined that the request failed to achieve the President's
      goals and began to work with the Department of Defense to rectifY this situation.
      Secretary Cohen provided the leadership necessary to ensure that the Department of
      Defense's budget would meet the President's goals and objectives.


$195 Million Anti-Drug Youth Media Campaign

Q.    What is the campaign?

A.    The campaign is a nationwide paid media campaign to use the full force of the media --
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

      regarding this matter should be directed to the Department ofJustice.

$195 Million Anti-Drug Youth Media Campaign

Q.    What is the campaign?

A.    The campaign is a nationwide paid media campaign to use the full force of the media --
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


      from television to the Internet to Sports marketing -- to educate kids and parents about the
      dangers of drugs.

Q.    What is the status ofthe campaign?

A.    Congress has appropriated the money for the media campaign and the President has
      signed the appropriations bill into law. ONDCP submitted to the members of the
      relevant committees a plan for implementing the campaign, as required under the
      legislation, and Congress has approved the plan. Phase I of the campaign will begin next
      month, with ads running in 12 pilot cities to evaluate the campaign. The 12 pilot cities
      are: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boise, Denver, Hartford, Houston, Milwaukee, Portland
      (OR), San Diego, Sioux City, Tucson, and Washington, D.C.

      Once the evaluation phase is completed, the campaign will go nationwide. Every
      American child willieam about the dangers of drugs when they tune in to prime-time
      television, listen to the radio, and surf the Internet.

Q.    Will the ad campaign really have any effect on youth drug use?

A.    We believe it will. While television ads have been found to be among the most efficient
      and effective means of reducing drug use, anti-drug public service messages and news
      coverage of drug issues have dropped markedly since 1989. The media campaign will
      involve the use of both paid and public service advertisements to get the message to kids
      and their parents about the dangers of drugs.

      The amount of funding for the media campaign is based on an estimate from the
      Partnership for a Drug-Free America and ad agencies for the level of ad exposure
      necessary to change attitudes and increase risk perception. Youth drug use has increased
      because risk perceptions have diminished. In 1990, 86.3 percent of kids, ages 12 to 17,
      said cocaine use was a high-risk behavior, and 40.4 percent said marijuana use was risky.
       By 1994, high-risk perception rates fell to 81.4 percent for cocaine and to 32.6 percent
      for marijuana. During the same time, 1992-1996, overall drug-use rates among youth
      increased. By increasing risk perceptions, coupled with positive messages of
      opportunity, the campaign will help steer kids away from drugs.

High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas

Q.    What was today's announcement regarding the creation of a Central Florida
      HIDTA?

A.    Today, the Administration -- and Florida Members of Congress in a separate press
      conference-- announced the formation of the Central Florida HIDTA. The Director will
      soon fulfill the statutory requirements to officially designate the Central Florida HIDTA.
       However, the President recently signed funding for this HlDTA-- $1 million in new
      money-- into law and an Executive Committee has been formed to help.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


Q.   Why was Central Florida selected for a HIDTA?

A.   Data provided by Central Florida authorities indicates that the 1-4 Corridor, from Tampa
     to Orlando, is a critical juncture for drug trafficking. The data also shows that organized
     drug trafficking has increased in the area with over 75 such groups operating in Tampa
     alone. The 1-4 Corridor has the highest rate of heroin deaths per capita in Florida,
     Orlando ranks fifth in the nation for cocaine related deaths. During 1996 alone, the
     Orlando area experienced 30 heroin overdose deaths, many ofthem by young people.
                                          .                                    .




Q.   What is the HIDTA program? What is a HIDTA?

A.   The "RIDTA" program provides federal assistance to better coordinate and enhance
     counter-drug law enforcement -- from the local to the federal level -- in those critical
     areas of the nation that are centers of drug production, manufacturing, importation, or ..
     distribution.


Q.   How does a HIDT A get designated, or created?

A.   RIDTA's are designated by the Director ofONDCP, in consultation with the Attorney
     General, heads of the national drug program agencies, and the appropriate Governors.
     The criteria for designating a RIDTA are:

    the extent to which the area is a center of illegal drug production, manufacturing,
     importation or distribution;
     the extent to which State and local law enforcement agencies have committed resources
     to respond to the drug threat;
    the extent to which drug-related activities in the area are having a harmful impact in other
     areas of the country; and,
    the extent to which a significant increase in allocation of Federal resources is necessary to
     respond adequately to drug-related activities in the area.

Q.   How many HIDTAs are there?

A.   There are 22 RIDTAs (including the five Southwest Border HIDTAs) in operation now.
      The Central RIDTA will be the 23rd designated RIDTA. Under the Clinton
     Administration the number of RIDTAs has grown from 5 to now 23; resources for the
     program have grown from $25 million in FY90 to .$162 million in FY98.
