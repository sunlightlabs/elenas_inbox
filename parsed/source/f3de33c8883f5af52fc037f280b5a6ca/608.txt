 TEXT:
 Attached is a brief description of the Senate Republican omnibus crime
 bill introduced earlier this week.  The omnibus bill appears to be a
 collection of separate bills pulled together into one package.  For
 example, the youth crime title was also introduced as a stand alone bill
 (S. 10). The gang subtitle is the Hatch-Feinstein gang bill.

 Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.==================== ATTACHMENT       1
