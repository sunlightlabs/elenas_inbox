      ACCEPT                                REGRET                                PENDING


TO:                    Stephanie Street, Director of Scheduling and Advance

FROM:                  Bruce Reed, Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

REQUEST:               Presidential Event Releasing the Fourth Grade Results from the Third
                       International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).

PURPOSE:              To highlight the importance of benchmarking student achievement in
                      mathematics and science education, and to set the stage for the
                      Administration's "action strategy" for science and mathematics education
                      reform.

BACKGROUND:           The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) will be releasing the
                      U.S. grade 4 findings from the TIMSS. Twenty-six countries participated
                      in the grade 4 assessment, compared with 41 in grade 8. Of the G-7
                      nations, the U.S., Canada, England and Japan participated (France,
                      Germany, and Italy did not).

                       The grade 4 results paint a very different picture of early U.S. mathematics
                       and science performance than appeared in grade 8;
                                     U.S. grade 4 mathematics performance is above the
                                              international average. We perform significantly
better than                                   12 of the 26 countries, including England, and
perform                                       comparably with Slovenia, Ireland, Hungary,
Australia,                                            Canada, and Israel. We trail Japan as well
as six other                                          countries (Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong,
Netherlands,                                  Czech Republic, and Austria).
                                     U.S. grade 4 science performance is among the top nations
                              of the world. We trail only Korea, are comparable with
                       Japan, Austria, Australia, the Netherlands, and the Czech
               Republic, and score better than England, Canada,
        Singapore, and 16 other nations.
                      These patterns are consistent with earlier international studies (we do
              better in the early grades, and in science, as opposed to math), but the
        magnitude of the difference here is considerably greater.
                      Three major points are apparent from the grade 4 data:
                                     The U.S. gets off to an internationally competitive start
                                      with respect to math and (especially) science performance;
                                     As was true in grade 8, we do considerably better in science
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
                                than math;
                               Relative to other countries, there's a major U.S.
                                performance slide in both science and math between grades
                                4 and 8.


PREVIOUS
PARTICIPATION:   The President spoke earlier this year at the release of international
                 achievement data from TIMSS when the "First in the World" consortium
                 report for school districts outside Chicago was released in late January.
                 He later recognized TIMSS and the performance of these districts in his
                 State of the Union message.

DATE & TIME:     Tuesday, June 10 at 11am. As with the grade 8 TIMSS findings from last
                 Fall, the U.S. release will follow by an hour the international grade 4
                 results being released by the lEA at Boston College in Boston.
                 International agreements prevent the findings from being released before
                 the international data (set for lOam on the 10th).

LOCATION:        Currently scheduled for The National Press Club but could be moved to
                 the White House.

PARTICIPANTS:    About 300 education, business, civic, and government officials.

OUTLINE
OF EVENTS:       The Commissioner of Education Statistics would formally release the data.
                 The President would then make remarks.
