                                                   PRESIDENT CLINTON:
                                        HELPING PROVIDE ACCESS TO PROTECTION AND
                                            HEALTH COVERAGE FOR OUR SENIORS    Automated Records Management System
                                                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                   July 6, 1998

                "Today I am launching a national effort to educate every single Medicare recipient about this opportunity -- using the mail,
      Medicare and Social Security notices, case workers, field offices, working with state governments, and using the Internet. Through this
      effort, hundreds of thousands of older and low-income Americans will receive more affordable health care without any new
      Congressional action. This is a duty we owe our parents and our fellow citizens, and we should honor it. It is the ~ight thing to do. "

                                                                                                       President Bill Clinton
                                                                                                       July 6, 1998

      Today, President Clinton announced a new outreach campaign to help millions of low-income senior citizens and people with
      disabilities receive assistance in paying Medicare premiums. The President has requested that the Department of Health and
      Human Services (HHS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) launch a multi-faceted effort to enroll eligible Medicare
      beneficiaries in the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program and related programs that pay for Medicare premiums and, for
      eligible recipients, copayments and deductibles.

      THE NEED To INFORM MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES OF THEIR OPTIONS. A study by Families USA reports that over 3 million
      low-income Medicare beneficiaries are not enrolled in either the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program or related
      programs that pay Medicare premiums and, for eligible recipients, copayments and deductibles. These assistance programs were
      expanded in last year's Balanced Budget Act. However, many eligible beneficiaries are not aware of these cost-sharing protections
      and others have difficulty accessing this critically needed assistance.

      A PRESIDENTIAL PLAN TO EDUCATE ELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS. The President is calling on the Department of Health and Human
      Services (HHS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) to launch a multi-faceted effort to enroll eligible Medicare
      beneficiaries in QMB and related programs. HHS and SSA will make unprecedented efforts to ensure that beneficiaries know
      about these programs, including:

             Sending Written Information To All 38 Million Medicare Beneficiaries about this vital program;
             Informing Every New Medicare Beneficiary about this program in the initial enrollment package they receive;
             Including Information Describing This Program And An Eligibility Screening Worksheet on the new Medicare Web
              Site, www.Medicare.gov.;
             Sending Program Information To More Than 36 Million Individuals receiving Social Security benefits in the annual
              cost-of-living adjustment notices distributed in the fall.
             Distributing 450,000 Pamphlets and placing posters in SSA's 1,300 field offices;
             Targeting Eligible Beneficiaries through direct mailings. SSA will identify, and the Health Care Financing
              Administration (HCFA) will send out, a letter to those most likely to be eligible for this program.

      WORKING WITH STATES AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR To DEVELOP ENROLLMENT STRATEGIES. This initiative wiJI bring
      together federal and state agencies and the private sector to enroll eligible recipients. These efforts include:

             Encouraging The Use Of A Simplified Application Process. The HCFA wiJI send a letter to State Medicaid agencies
              that includes a model. simplified application as well as examples of successful outreach and enrollment programs. HCFA
              will encourage states to adopt simple, user-friendly procedures such as a mail-in application.
             Creating A Federal-State-Consumer Advocate Task Force to develop new strategies to enroll eligible beneficiaries.
              HHS, SSA, the National Governor's Association and advocates of the elderly and people with disabilities will collaborate
              to identify and implement strategies to educate beneficiaries about this program and make enrollment easier.
             Providing The State Insurance Counseling And Assistance Programs (ICAs) With Material to assist beneficiaries in
              enrolling in the premium assistance program.

      BUILDING ON A COMMITMENT To THOSE IN NEED. Today's announcement builds on President Clinton's ongoing commitment
      to identifying and enrolling vulneraple, low income Americans in this important program. Already, HCFA is providing training
      material on identifying and assisting potential beneficiaries to health care providers, advocates, and States. SSA has included
      information on programs in SSA pamphlets and handouts and conducted training for staff who interact with beneficiaries. These
      efforts, along with today's initiatives, are helping to ensure that those in need are given the protections and coverage they deserve.
