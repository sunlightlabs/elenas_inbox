                        MORE EVIDENCE THAT THE ECONOMY CONTINUES
                  To GROW STEADY .AND STRONG            UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON
                                                April 3D, 1997



TODAY'S REPORT SHOWS THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY CONTINUES TO ENJOY ROBUST
GROWTH AND MODERATE INFLATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER, THE ECONOMY GREW BY
5.6 PERCENT AT AN ANNUAL RATE -- THE FASTEST IN A DECADE. REAL INCOMES ARE
RISING. AND INFLATION REMAINS MODERATE.

      Growth was 5.6 Percent on an Annualized Basis. Investment in business equipment rose 12.9
       percent, and exports rose 8.1 percent.

      Private-Sector Growth Continues to be Stronger than Either of the Previous Two Administrations. In
       the first quarter, the private sector grew by 7.0 percent at an annual rate. Under Clinton, the
       private sector has grown by 3.5 percent per year, compared to 3.0 percent under Reagan and 1.3
       percent under Bush.

      Inflation Remains Low. Inflation as measured by the CDP price deflator was 2.3 percent in the
       first quarter. The related CDP price index rose slightly faster, but both were affected by statistical
       artifacts involving falling oil prices.

      First Investment-Led Expansion in Three Decades. Under President Clinton, business investment
       has increased at a 10.5 percent annual rate -- stronger than any Administration since JFK.

      Once Again the Administrations Forecasts Appear Conservative.   In this year's budget, we projected
       growth for 1997 to be 2.2 percent -- and even if there is no growth for the rest of the year, we
       have already exceeded that.

WE HA VE 11.9 MILLION NEW JOBS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 5.2 PERCENT. THE
ECONOMY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE STRONG GROWTH, RAPID INVESTMENT, AND LOW
INFLATION

EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG:
      Allen Sinai, one of America's top economic forecasters, 4/30/97: "Job growth is good. Real income is
       rising. Sentiment is high. Unemployment is the lowest in years: Times are good for American
       consumers. "

      Mickey Levy, chief economist, NationsBank, 2/1/97: "It's really the best of all worlds. Growth at a
       healthy pace, but with the economy not overheating and continued very favorable news on
       inflation. "

      Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 8/3/96: "It's been a remarkable period of
       steady growth, low inflation and low unemployment."
