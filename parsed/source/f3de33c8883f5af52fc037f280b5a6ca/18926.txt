               CHILD CARE EVENT: TOUR OF CENTER AND SPEECH

                              DATE:           Tuesday, March 10, 1998
                              LOCATION: Housatonic Community-Technical

                                                           College
                                                    Bridgeport, Connecticut
                             TIME:                  10:50 to 11:40 am
                             FROM:                  Bruce Reed

I.     PURPOSE

To underscore your commitment to making child care better, safer, and more affordable for
America's working families by: (1) issuing an executive memorandum to improve
federally-sponsored child care, and (2) releasing a new HHS report that reveals a pressing
need for greater child care investment.

II.    BACKGROUND

In Bridgeport, Connecticut, you will tour a model child care center at Housatonic
Community-Technical College and then give a speech to a group of child care advocates,
community leaders, elected officials, and students. Connecticut is the home of many
congressional sponsors of child care legislation, including Senator Chris Dodd, and Reps.
Barbara Kennelly, Nancy Johnson, and Rosa DeLauro. In addition, Connecticut recently
passed bipartisan state legislation to promote early learning and improve child care
quality.

Executive Memorandum to Improve Federally-Sponsored Child Care

You will direct executive agencies to take the following new steps to improve the quality of
federally-sponsored child care:

       (1) Ensure proper thorough and timely background checks on child care workers in
       federally-sponsored child care.

       (2) Achieve 100 percent national accreditation offederally-sponsored child care by
       the year 2000. Accreditation is done by nonprofit, non-governmental professional
       organizations to validate safety and quality. Currently, 76 percent of military child care

                                                1
       compared to an estimated 7 percent nationally.
       (3) Explore opportunities for collaboration both within government and with the private
       sector to improve the quality and affordability of federally sponsored child care.

       (4) Ensure that all federal workers have full information on child care benefits and
       options available to them.

Release of New HHS Report on Child Care

HHS' new report, The Child Care and Development Block Grant - A Report a/State Plans,
outlines the strategies that states have developed to administer the Child Care and
Development Block Grant. The report contains two key findings:

      States need more resources to help working families afford child care. The welfare law
       allows states to use the Child Care and Development Block Grant to provide child care
       subsidies to lower-income working families -- defined as families with less than 85
       percent of state median income. This new report shows that because of resource
       constraints, some states set eligibility levels far below what is allowed by federal law.
       For example, in 10 states, a family of three with as little as $20,000 of income is not
       eligible for any help with child care costs. In as many as 37 states, a family of three with
       $28,000 of income is not eligible for any help with child care subsidy. Further, most
       states have insufficient funds even to subsidize all families meeting their eligibility
       requirements.

      States have innovative strategies to improve child care quality, such as scholarships and
       basic training for child care providers, tax credits for businesses that offer child care
       services, initiatives to link the child care and health care communities, support for
       resource and referral services, and initiatives to expand school-age care.

New Report by the Children's Defense Fund

On Tuesday morning, the Children's Defense Fund will issue a report of state expenditures of the
child care block grant. The report, titled Locked Doors: States Struggling to meet the Child
Care Needs a/Low-Income Working Families, makes the following findings, which are generally
consistent with those of the HHS report:

      State child care subsidy programs are so underfunded that they cut off eligibility at family
       income levels far below what is allowed by federal law and what is needed by families.

      Even those low-income working families that do meet state income guidelines frequently

                                                2
       eligible low-income working families or put them on lengthy waiting lists for help.



Congressional Legislation on the Hill

Several Congressional leaders on child care are from Connecticut, including Senator Dodd, and
Reps. Kennelly, Johnson, and DeLauro. All of their bills contain several elements included in
your initiative, but most also include an initiative targeted to stay-at-home parents as well. In
particular, Senator Dodd's bill, which is co-sponsored by 25 Senate Democrats, includes many of
the elements of your initiative, such as a significant expansion of the Child Care and'
Development Block Grant, an expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, a tax
credit for businesses that provide child care, an increase in the investment in after-school
programs, and a fund targeted to early learning and quality improvements; it also includes a
provision to assist stay-at-home parents.

Recent Action on Child Care in Connecticut

Connecticut passed landmark child care/school readiness legislation in the 1997 session, on a
bipartisan basis. The legislation provides full access to child care for three and four years olds,
with emphasis on quality, parent involvement, family literacy, transition to school, and health
linkages. Programs must be accredited to receive state dollars. Health care is linked to the
legislation by requiring child care providers to ensure that children have had necessary and timely
health screens. The legislation invested $60 million in this area.

Housatonic Community-Technical College's Early Childhood Laboratory School

Housatonic Community-Technical College enrolls 3,300 students and offers generalized
two-year degree programs. The student body is 66% female and the average age is 29. The
college's Early Childhood Laboratory School is a nationally-accredited center serving 40
children, in two classes of twenty. The ratio of teachers to children is roughly one to six. The
staff ranges from those with Masters in Early Childhood Education to two former welfare
recipients. Also, community college students serve as externs in the center to gain experience
towards their degrees in early childhood education.
