Q.    What is the Department of Education report on School Poverty and Academic
      Performance?

      The Department of Education released a report today that examines the relationship
      between school poverty and student achievement, comparing trends in the performance of
      4th graders in high- and low-poverty schools on reading and math tests from the National
      Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The report shows that students generally
      do less well if they attend a school where the majority of students are from disadvantaged
      circumstances. While this is a long-standing and continuing trend, though the report also
      shows that students in high poverty schools are making progress in math.


Q.    What is a "high poverty school?"

      In this report, a school in which half or more of the students come from low-income
      families are considered to be high-poverty. Overall, 34% of the nation's schools fit this
      definition. In urban communities, more than 3/4 of the schools are often high poverty
      schools.

Q.    If high poverty schools have lower achievement, shouldn't the Administration's
      efforts be focused on reducing poverty instead of on the schools themselves?

      One of the reasons that students in high poverty schools have poor achievement is
      because the schools have fewer educational resources--they tend to have fewer
      well-prepared teachers, larger classes, lower standards and weaker curriculum. The
      Administration's education proposals are designed to tum those conditions around.


School Safety

Q.    Are these school-based partnerships grants new? And how are they different from
      other actions the President has recommended with regard to putting more law
      enforcement in schools?

A.    The $16.4 million in grants released earlier today are the first ever to go out under the
      COPS School-Based Partnerships grant program. The President first highlighted the
      program in March, when the Justice Department announced the availability of the funds.
      The new initiative not only encourages partnerships between local police departments and
      schools, but also emphasizes using community policing principles to help prevent and
      combat school crime.

     James Maloney (D-CN) to help provide for the hiring of more school safety officers
     through the COPS program. The COPS Office has already provided funds for localities
     to hire school safety officers -- including Jonesboro, Arkansas which last month received a
     grant to hire 15 school safety officers.


Q.   What else is the Administration doing on school safety?

A.   In addition to continuing to challenge the Congress to pass his comprehensive youth
     violence strategy to address the overarching problem of juvenile crime, the President has
     taken many actions to address the safety of our nation's schools:

    White House Conference On School Safety.   In July, the President announced a White
     House Conference on School Safety, and proclaimed October 15, 1998, National School
     Safety Day. The White House Conference will be linked by satellite to communities and
     schools across the country, including those communities affected by the recent wave of
     school shootings.

    Early warning guide. Last month, the President released a guide he directed the
     Attorney General and Secretary of Education to develop -- for teachers and principals
     identify and respond to the early warning signs of troubled youth that can lead to school
     violence. Last week, copies were sent to every school in the country for the start of the
     school year.

    First Annual Report on School Safety. In December, the President called for the
     development of an Annual Report on School Safety, which will be released on School
     Safety Day, October 15. The report will include: an analysis of all existing national
     school crime data and an overview of state and local crime reporting; examples of schools
     and strategies that are successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and class
     disruption; actions that parents can take locally to combat school crime, including a local
     safety checklist; and resources available to schools and communities to help create safe,
     disciplined, and drug-free schools.

    Safe and Drug-Free Schools. President Clinton expanded the Drug-Free Schools Act into
     the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act of 1994, making violence prevention a key part of
     this program, and has proposed to increase funds for the program by $50 million in FY
     99. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program provides support for violence and drug
     prevention programs to 97 of the nation's school districts.

    Zero Tolerance for Guns in Schools.    In October 1994, President Clinton signed into law
     the Gun-Free Schools Act, and issued a Presidential Directive later that month to enforce
     "zero tolerance" for guns in schools -- if a student brings a gun to school, that student will
     be expelled for a year. In 1997, over 6,000 students were expelled for bringing guns to

   School Uniforms. School uniforms have been found to be a promising strategy to reduce
    violence while promoting discipline and respect in school. Because of this, the Clinton
    Administration has encouraged schools to consider adopting school uniform policies by
    sharing with every school district a school uniforms manual prepared by the Department
    of Education in consultation with local communities and the Department of Justice.

   Cracking Down on Truancy. Truancy prevention initiatives have been shown to keep
    more children in school and dramatically reduce daytime crime. The President, through
    the Education Department, issued a guidebook to the 15,000 school districts nationwide
    which outlines the central characteristics of a comprehensive truancy prevention policy
    and highlights model initiatives in cities and towns across the country.
