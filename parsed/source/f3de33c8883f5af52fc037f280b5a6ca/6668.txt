MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                   Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                Meeting with Senator McCain

        As you know, Senator McCain is leading an effort -- blessed by Trent Lott -- to report a
comprehensive bill out of the Commerce Committee. McCain is talking extensively with
Senators Breaux, Wyden, and Hollings, as well as with Republicans on the Committee. McCain
is currently working off a draft bill that has significant weaknesses, especially with regard to
price and FDA jurisdiction. There is little doubt, however, that McCain would like our support
and that he is listening carefully to our concerns. We met with his staff on Friday to review a
number of issues.

Talking Points

                The President wants comprehensive, bipartisan legislation this year. Every day
                 we delay, 3,000 kids become regular smokers and 1,000 of them will die
                 prematurely from this addiction.

                The President has made his priorities clear. To gain his support, a bill must:

                 ~      Raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years
                        and imposes tough penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids;

                 ~      Expressly confirm the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products;

                 ~      Get tobacco companies out of the business of marketing to children;

                 ~      Further public health research and goals;

                 ~      Protect tobacco farmers and their communities.

                We want to work with you to ensure that the Commerce Committee reports out a
                 bill that the President can support.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion        .


MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                   Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                Meeting with Representative Deborah Pryce

        As you know, most of the legislative activity on tobacco so far has taken place in the
Senate. The House remains inactive. Bliley has held some hearings and may try to draft
legislation, but prospects for a Bliley-Waxman collaboration now seem slight. The House
Republican leadership is interested in tobacco revenue to pay for tax cuts, but has done nothing
to spur legislative action.

        Speaker Gingrich has appointed Representative Deborah Pryce as his leadership team's
point person on tobacco. A key goal of the meeting should be to persuade her that the
President does not want to play politics with this issue, and that he is serious about enacting
bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco legislation this year.

Talking Points

                The President wants comprehensive, bipartisan legislation this year. Every day
                 we delay, 3,000 kids become regular smokers and 1,000 of them will die
                 prematurely from this addiction.

                The President has made his priorities clear. He has called on Congress to enact
                 comprehensive, bipartisan legislation that:

                 ~      Raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years
                        and imposes tough penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids;

                 ~      Expressly confirms the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products;

                 ~      Gets tobacco companies out of the business of marketing to children;

                 ~      Furthers public health research and goals;

                 ~      Protects tobacco farmers and their communities:

                We want to work together with the Republican leadership in both the House and




     Senate to enact a bipartisan bill this year.
