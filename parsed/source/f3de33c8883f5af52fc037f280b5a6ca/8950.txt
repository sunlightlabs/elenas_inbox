                                           August 8, 1998

In his radio address to the nation, President Clinton will: (1) announce that, in 1997, the rate and number
of alcohol-related fatalities dropped to their lowest levels since record-keeping began in 1975; and (2)
renew his challenge to Congress to save even more lives by setting a nationwide drunk driving standard of
.08 blood alcohol content (BAC).

Drunk Driving: Reaching A Historic Low

       Fewest Alcohol-Related Deaths Since 1975. According to the Transportation Department's
        Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), the rate of alcohol-related crashes fell from nearly
        41 % in 1996 to 38.6% in 1997 - the first time since the Transportation Department began
        record-keeping in 1975 that the rate dropped below 40%. And since 1986, the overall number of
        alcohol-related fatalities has dropped by a third.

       Decline in Youth Killed by Drunk Drivers. The 1997 FARS data also shows that alcohol-related
        deaths among 16 to 20 year-olds dropped 5%. Reducing the number of young people killed in
        alcohol-related crashes has been a cornerstone of the President's effort to combat drunk driving.

Working to Make .08 the Law o(the Land

       Fighting for a Tough National Standard. President Clinton continues to challenge Congress to
        enact legislation that makes .08 BAC the legal limit for impaired driving. The President strongly
        supports bipartisan legislation that would give states three years to enact .08 legislation, or risk
        losing highway funds. Sixteen states have already adopted .08 laws: Utah, Oregon, Maine,
        California, Vermont, Kansas, North Carolina, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Florida, Virginia,
        Hawaii, Alabama, Idaho, Illinois, and Washington.

       Taking Executive Action on .08. Although Congress failed to enact .08 legislation as part of
        omnibus transportation legislation it recently passed, the President continues to lead by example.
        On March 3, 1998, he directed the Secretary of Transportation to work with safety groups, the
        States, Federal agencies, and others to develop a plan to: (1) make .08 BAC the standard on
        federal property; (2) work with tribes to make .08 the limit in Indian Country; and (3) launch an
        education campaign on the risks of drinking and driving. The Secretary recently submitted such a
        plan to the President, and he has accepted the Secretary's recommendations.

President Clinton: A Record ofLeadership

       Putting Safety First. Safety has always been President Clinton's highest transportation priority,
        and the decline in alcohol-related deaths announced today is a result of that commitment. This
        Administration's highway safety priorities include taking on drunk and aggressive driving, and
        increasing seat belt use.

       Zero Tolerance Now the Law in 50 States. In 1995, President Clinton fought for and signed
        legislation requiring states to have "zero alcohol tolerance" laws for youth by October I, 1998, or
        risk losing highway funds. At that time, just 24 states and D.C. had zero tolerance laws. This
        past June, South Carolina became the 50th -- and final -- state to adopt a zero tolerance law.
