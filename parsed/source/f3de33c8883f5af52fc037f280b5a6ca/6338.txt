 TEXT:
 Attached is a revised version of the memo on education conferences, which
 just never gets to the top of my list.  It has been revised with input
 from Bob Shireman, particularly with respect to a Hispanic Dropout
 conference that NEC is on the hook for.

 I think its time to send this forward, especially if we want to get
 something going with ACHIEVE on the tests over the next few weeks.    They
 will press us for some committment on the Transcript conference they are
 interested in.

  Gene has not seen this yet, despite Bob's involvement.  I wanted you two
 to sign off before giving it to Gene.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ===========

SUBJECT:              White House Conference on Strengthening Public Education and related
                      events

We are proposing four high visibility education events, to be implemented before the end of the
school year in June, that will provide a number of opportunities for the President to highlight
and demonstrate broad support for his education agenda. As a package, these events will
underscore the President's commitment to strengthening public education by raising standards,
promoting public school choice, investing in quality and promoting accountability, and draw a
contrast with the Republican agenda of promoting vouchers and abandoning public schools.

The proposed events, listed in the order in which they should occur, are:
      A roundtable discussion with business leaders showcasing employer efforts to support
       high standards.
      A Mayor's Conference on Public Schools, with Presidential participation.
      A "Staying in School" event focusing on effective approaches to increasing high school
       graduation rates, with a special emphasis on Hispanics.
      A White House Conference on Strengthening Public Schools, featuring local success
       stories that reflect the Administration's agenda.

These events are described in more detail below.


1. Roundtable Discussion on Business Community "Transcript Project"

Background: The Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National
Alliance of Business have endorsed the President's proposal for voluntary national tests. They
have also each endorsed a common policy statement on the importance of high standards in
education--one key part of which calls on employers to review high school transcripts or other
evidence of academic achievement of prospective employees in order to underscore the
importance of standards. This builds on a commitment business leaders made at the 1996
National Education Summit, to implement hiring practices that will require entry-level job


                                               1
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

applicants to demonstrate high school academic achievement, and to send a powerful message to
students that performance in school counts.

More than 500 employers around the country have already begun to implement this initiative, as
part of broader business/education partnerships working in collaboration with local school
systems to raise standards and strengthen public schools. Nationally, IBM, Bell South, Eastman
Chemical and Eastman Kodak are the leading companies implementing and promoting this idea.

BRT, NAB and the Chamber, along with ACHIEVE (led by Lou Gerstner of IBM) have asked
for the President to endorse their efforts (know as the "Transcript Project") and give them
additional visibility.

The Event: A roundtable discussion involving the President, key national business leaders
(including Lou Gerstner), education leaders, and local employers, educators and current and
former students, highlighting business efforts around the country that send kids the message that
academic performance counts.

The business groups have identified a number of communities/states where this initiative is
working especially well, and which could serve as ideal sites for an event. These include
Orange County CA, Rochester NY, Berks County P A, and Kingsport TN.

Possible announcements: The President could announce that 500+ businesses already have
signed on and challenge other employers to follow suit. The business leaders would call on
Congress and states to support the national tests; and announce their support for the President's
efforts to end social promotions, including, possibly, for the Education Opportunity Zones
proposal.

With sufficient advanced notice, the business groups would be willing to help amplify the event
by using the Chamber of Commerce's satellite capability to transmit the event to local
business/education partnership events they would organize throughout the country.

Time frame: March


2. U.S. Conference of Mayors Conference on Public Education

Background: Last fall the U.S. Conference of Mayors approached us about a possible joint
White House/USCM Conference on Public Education, as a vehicle to highlight the emerging
leadership role of mayors in education, to encourage additional mayors to play important
leadership roles in local education issues, and to give the mayors a greater voice in the national
education discussion. Heightened involvement of mayors in education is good for education,
and mayors are an important source of support for our education initiatives, ranging from
America Reads to the national tests.

                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

Last month when the mayors were at the White House, the President accepted the USCM
invitation to speak at their conference. Staff from DPC and Intergovernmental Affairs staff have
met with representatives of USCM and its chair, Mayor Daley in order to better understand the
USCM objectives and proposal. Based on these discussions, we believe the approach outlined
below is workable.

The Event: The President would host a 1-2 hour meeting (pool spray, then closed press) with
mayors to discuss public education. This meeting would occur the morning after a day-long
Mayors Conference on Public Education, organized by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The
participants will be mayors, though local education leaders, school board members and teachers'
organizations will be invited to participate as well. The White House and Education
Department will work closely with USCM on the development of the conference program, to
ensure that the agenda reflects Administration priorities to the maximum extent possible. As
appropriate, Administration officials will participate in the conference.

The conference enables us to strengthen our ties with the mayors over education issues, and will
be another opportunity to build and highlight support for the President's overall education
agenda, and we can help structure the conference agenda so that it features those issues in which
we and the mayors and most in agreement. USCM believes this approach furthers its objective
of promoting mayoral involvement in education, and Mayor Daley's office believes this would
meet the Mayor's particular objective as well.

The Mayors could be asked to organize local events linked to the White House Conference on
Strengthening Public Education described below.

Possible Announcements: We believe it will be possible to announce USMC endorsements for
a number of our education initiatives, such as school modernization and Education Opportunity
Zones.
Time frame: April - May

3. Hispanic Dropout Conference
NEC has been working closely with the Hispanic Caucus on the development of a Hispanic
Education Initiative. In this context, some Members of Congress have urged that the
Administration hold a White House Conference on Hispanic Dropouts, or at least on the
dropout problem generally.

While this topic is probably too narrow in scope for a full White House Conference, it is
important to find a way to respond positively to this request. At present, NEC is
considering some Presidential and Administration involvement in a conference to share
solutions to the dropout problem (Hispanic and others). The conference would highlight
lessons from successful efforts to reduce dropout rates and to provide youth with
alternatives to traditional high schools. The conference could also be a vehicle for


                                               3
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

highlighting the Administration's High Hopes College/School Partnership initiative.

The event: A consortium of outside groups --such as the Ford Foundation and the
Brookings Institution --would sponsor a conference on "Staying in School." It would
feature presentations of research on the reasons for high dropout rates, and more
important, effective approaches to reducing dropout rates. The President would help to
open the conference with a roundtable discussion with school professionals who have
battled the dropout problem.       This would demonstrate how the Administration's
approaches: high academic standards, charter schools, smaller class sizes, etc., relate to
problems like high dropout rates. The message would be that there are solutions that
make a difference, and the President would ask them and others participating in the
conference to report back with recommendations for how to share and implement these
solutions more broadly.

Possible Announcement: To be determined

Time frame: open


4. White House Conference on Strengthening Public Education

Background: Recent White House conferences on Early Learning and Child Care have been
opportunities to focus public attention on critical issues and to create a common point of
departure for the field and the Administration. They served as launching pads for new
Administration initiatives, and became events that the Administration, the field and the press
could repeatedly point to as something that galvanized action.

The President already has an ambitious agenda for public education, centered around standards,
choice, accountability and investments in quality (e.g., technology, class size reductions). A
White House Conference would:

      HigJ:1light key aspects of the President's approach to strengthening public education by
       focusing attention on successful local and state efforts, consistent with the President's
       priorities and initiatives.

      Demonstrate broad support for the President's agenda by bringing together education,
       business and community leaders, state and local officials around agenda to strengthen
       public schools.                                               \

      Provide an opportunity to contrast Administration efforts to strengthen public education
       with Republican efforts to undermine it.

      Provide a launching pad for new Administration initiatives to be proposed to the next


                                              4
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

       Congress, when Goals 2000, Title 1, and other major elementary and secondary education
       programs are to be reauthorized.

In addition to previous White House conferences organized by the Clinton Administration, two
earlier Education Summits provide a context that will frame public perceptions of this event.
The first was the 1989 Education Summit President Bush held with the governors, which led to
the National Education Goals. Gov. Clinton was the lead governor for this event. The second
was the 1996 National Education Summit Lou Gerstner organized for the governors and 50
CEO's, focused on state efforts to raise standards and incorporate technology into education.
President Clinton spoke at that event.

The proposed White House conference will contrast with these events by being more inclusive
(involving parents, teachers, school board members, mayors and community groups in addition
to governors and CEO's) and more grass roots oriented (focusing more heavily on examples of
effective local practices than on state policies)


The Event: This would be a one day meeting, most likely in the East Room (though
conceivably held someplace outside of Washington, such as a high school), involving the
President, the Vice President, the First Lady, Mrs. Gore and Secretary Riley.

Participants would include a broad range of national, state and local leaders in education,
including parents, teachers and administrators, local school boards, mayors, business leaders,
governors and state education officials. The conference would be organized into 4-5 panel
discussions, each featuring a different set of issues that highlighted effective local practices tied
to the President's agenda.

For example, we could organize the panels around ways of achieving key goals (helping 8 year
olds to read, 12 year olds to log on to the Internet and learn math, preparing kids for college), or
around successful approaches to reform (e.g., promising urban reform efforts such as Chicago's;
successful college-school partnerships that provide mentoring; cutting-edge uses of technology in
schools). For each panel, we would have a mix of local educators, parents and community
leaders, mayors and governors, and business leaders .. The discussions would focus on what
works, how it can be spread to other places, and how the Administration initiatives are, or could
better, help.

Possible Announcements: To be determined

Time Frame:     Late Spring, or possible for Back-to-School (August-October).
