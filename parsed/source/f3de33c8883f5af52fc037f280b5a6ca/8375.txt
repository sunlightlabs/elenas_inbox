AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES
                                       APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY
1999
(Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana;           Skeen (R), New
Mexico)



        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and
Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as
reported by the House Appropriations Committee.  Your consideration of the
AdministrationD,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate the PresidentD,s priorities within the 302(b) allocation.   The
PresidentD,s FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by providing
savings through user fees and certain ,mandatory programs to help finance


discretionary spending.  In the recently enacted Transportation Equity
Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis -- took similar action in
approving funding for surface transportation programs paid for with
mandatory offsets. We want to work with the Congress on
mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be used to
increase high-priority discretionary programs, including those funded by
this bill.  In addition, we urge the Congress to adopt the user fee
proposals included in the PresidentO,s budget, which would enable over
$600 million to be directed to important initiatives such as those
proposed for food safety, nutrition programs, rural development, and
conservation.   '

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Committee-reported bill. We look forward to working with you to resolve
these concerns as the bill moves forward.

civil Rights

        The Administration strongly supports the provision made in order in the
rule that waives the statute of limitations for individuals who have
previously filed a discrimination claim against USDA.   The President is
personally committed to righting any wrongs' committed by USDA employees in
years past, and a great many individuals who were discriminated against
will have no recourse unless the statute of limitations is waived for them.

        In a number of areas, the Committee has reduced funds to assist
the most needy farmers and members of the rural community.   The Committee
has not provided the requested increase for the' Outreach for Socially
Disadvantaged Farmers program, which was a key recommendation of the Civil
Rights Action Team (CRAT) report last year. With the additional $7
million requested, USDA could support 35 projects to assist 10,000 small
family farms and stem the continuing reduction in the number of minority
farmers and ranchers.

        Another recommendation in the CRAT report is to increase the
amount of farm ownership loans, a portion of which are targeted to
minority and ,beginning farmers. The Administration urges the House to
shift the $1 million in unrequested subsidy increase provided in the bill
for boll weevil eradication loans to the farm ownership program, which
would permit another 140 limited-resource farmers to finance real estate
purchases.

Food Safety Initiative

         The Administration is deeply concerned that the Committee has not
fully funded the PresidentO,s request for Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and USDA activities to enhance food safety, providing only $16.8
million out of the $101 million the President has requested for these
activities, $96 million of which is requested in this bill.    American
consumers enjoy the worldO,s safest food supply, but too many Americans
get sick, and in some cases die, from preventable food-borne diseases.
The PresidentO,s budget increase would expand food safety research, risk
assessment capabilities, education, surveillance activities, and food
import i'nspections. The Administration wants to work with the Congresf; to.
explore user fee options within FDA and USDA that can be used to offset
the cost of the needed increases in these programs as well as provide
funds to further modernize the meat and poultry ,inspection system.

Women, Infants, and Children


         The Committee bill would freeze funding for the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) at
the FY 1998 level of $3.9 billion, $157 million below the PresidentD,s
request.   This would only support a participation level of between 7.3 and
7.4 million women, infants, and children, and, based on FY 1998 year-end
projections, would mean cutting off over 100,000 needy participants from
the program.   The PresidentD,s request would maintain participation at 7.5
million, fulfilling the bipartisan commitment to fully fund WIC.   The
Administration strongly encourages the House to fund WIC at the
PresidentD,s requested level.

Arms Export Control Act Modification

        The Administration supports section 737, which will ensure that
American farmers can continue to export wheat and other commodities to
India and Pakistan through USDA export assistance programs. As the
President recently announced, in the sanctions the U.S. is applying toward
those countries, we are attempting to minimize the humanitarian impact on
their people.   Cutting off the supply of U.S. wheat would only hurt the
citizens of Pakistan and India, as well as American farmers, without
furthering the goal of nuclear nonproliferation.  The Administration urges
adoption of this provision.

Rural Development Funding

        While the Administration supports the funds provided for the Rural
Community Advancement Program (RCAP), the Administration strongly objects
to the CommitteeD,s blocking the mandatory Fund for Rural America from
being used in FY 1999. The Fund provides additional resources for rural
development and innovative agricultural research that are vitally needed
to improve the quality of life in rural America and increase the
productivity of U.S. farmers.   The intent of Congress in creating the Fund
in 1996 was to boost the overall Federal investment in these activities,
not to offset discretionary spending in them.   Furthermore, Congress
recently extended the authority for the Fund while increasing its
resources.  The Administration urges the House to strike this provision.
In addition, for the RCAP program to be adaptable to unique local economic
development needs, as envisioned in its 1996 Farm Bill authorization, the
House should strike the CommitteeD,s limitation on the flexibility to
transfer funds among programs and allow the program to be implemented as
authorized.

Food and Drug Administration

        The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the full
$1,251 million in resources to fund the program level proposed for FDA in
the PresidentD,s budget.  The Administration is deeply disappointed and
concerned that the Committee has not funded the PresidentD,s request for
FDAD,s tobacco enforcement activities.  This funding is vital to the
AdministrationD,s plan to reduce youth smoking.  CongressD, failure thus
far to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation should not prevent the
Committee from providing adequate resources for these critical public
health activities. We will work with the Congress to develop the
appropriate means of funding.

Climate Change and Clean Water Initiatives

        The Committee has not provided any of the $7 million increase
requested for additional research as part of the Administration's Climate
Change Technology Initiative. These funds would support high-priority


research to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases caused by agricultural
practices, develop improved feedstocks that can be used to generate
energy, and improve techniques to convert agricultural products to
biofuels.  The Administration urges the House to provide the necessary
funding.

        The Committee also has not included the AdministrationD,s
requested increase of $23 million for the Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) to implement the PresidentD,s Clean Water Action Plan to
help State and local organizations hire watershed coordinators, document
baseline conditions, and target resources to farmers requesting
assistance.  The Plan, developed by USDA and EPA, outlines a strategy on
how to address water quali,ty problems, including polluted runoff, in
watershed areas across the Nation. The Administration urges the House to
provide these necessary funds to the NRCS.

Agricultural Research

        The Administration strongly objects to the CommitteeD,s
elimination of the $120 million in competitively-awarded research funds
authorized in the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform
Act of 1998. These funds will finance vital investments in food and
agriculture genome research, food safety and technology, human nutrition,
and agricultural biotechnology. At the same time, the Committee bill
includes over $50 ,million in unrequested earmarks for lower-priority
research while funding competitive grants through the National Research
Initiative (NRI) at $30 million below the PresidentD,s request.   This
systematic rejection of additional funds for competitive research grants
for national and regional priorities, in favor of earmarked grants for
more local or industry-specific requests, would slow progress toward
addressing the most pressing needs of American agriculture and food
consumers, and we urge the House to reverse this course of action.    The
House can do so not only by reducing earmarked grants in the bill, but by
reducing the $25 million in unrequested increases for the Agricultural
Research ServiceD,s buildings and facilities program.   A task force
created by the 1996 Farm Bill to review the NationD,s agricultural
research facilities comprehensively is due to report to Congress next
year, and further construction should be minimized until the
Administration and Congress have had the opportunity to review the .report.

Other Issues

         The Administration strongly opposes an amendment that may be offered
mandating peer review of "scientific data" supporting final regulations.
The Administration supports the peer review process for rule-making.
However, this amendment is not needed -- peer review is currently
incorporated in the Government-wide rule-making process through public
comment and scientific advisory boards.   This amendment as drafted would
impose an additional step in the review process and would cover a large
number of 'rules, as diverse as meat and poultry inspection rules, country
and product-specific quarantine rules, and the Animal and plant Health
Inspection Services annual fee regulations.   This would impose an undue
burden on numerous final rules by requiring substantial personnel and
other resources and could result in significant delays on important public
health and safety rules.

        Additional funds are needed for the farm labor housing program to
improve the living conditions many farm labor families endure.   The
CommitteeD,s ,$20 million in direct loans is more than 35 percent below the
AdministrationD,s request and would mean that 230 fewer housing units


would be built compared with the request.  In addition, the Committee
provides $69 million, or seven percent, less than requested for
single-family housing direct loans, which would keep 1,300 fewer
low-income rural families from achieving the dream of homeownership and
the ability to live in safe, decent, affordable housing.  The
Administration urges the House to increase funding to assist these needy
members of our society.

        The Committee bill includes a $10 million reduction to the
PresidentD,s request for the mandatory Emergency Food Assistance Program
(TEFAP), which purchases commodities for individuals greatly in need of
assistance. Given reported increases in need for food assistance through
food banks and soup kitchens, the Administration is concerned that this
reduction from the authorized level would mean less food will reach the
most vulnerable Americans.

        The Administration objects to section 722 of the Committee bill,
which would limit Executive Branch review of USDA responses to
congressional inquiries.  Congress expects the Administration to be
responsible for agency activities.  This provision erodes that
responsibility and is contrary to the widespread congressional view that
more, not less, accountability is needed for im~roved management results.
The Administration urges the House to delete the provision.,

        The Administration strongly objects to the Committee billD,s
provision that provides funding for research on nutrition programs only
within the Economic Research Service.  It is important that research on
nutrition programs also occur in the context of the programD,s
administration, and the Administration urges the Committee to provide
funding for these activities within the Food ,and Nutrition Service, as
requested and as included in the Senate version of the bill.

        The Committee has provided only $2 million of the requested $22
million increase for the Inspector General as part of the
AdministrationD,s law enforcement initiative.  This USDA initiative would
save taxpayers millions of dollars lost through fraud in the food and
nutrition programs, in USDA disaster, multi-family housing, and other
programs, as well as improve the integrity of USDA programs.  The
Administration urges the House to increase funds for this important
initiative.
