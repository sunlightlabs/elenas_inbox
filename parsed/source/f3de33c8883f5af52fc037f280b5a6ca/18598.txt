TEXT:
  Here are our major projects. We have not included the following
specific issues because they seemed speculative or at this point too
small:  single food agency; native american executive order; sex
orientation exec. order; war on heart attacks; virtual university; and DOJ
debt collection legislation.

Also there are a couple of other processes that might make sense but we
didn't include: 1.   21st Consumer. Work towards creating a consumer
financial bill of rights; and 2. Values group-- investigating ways to
promote family and responsibility-- including issues of father's
responsibilities, and alternatives/additions to the marriage penalty
option to encourage marriage.
