       MENTAL HEALTH AT THE FIRST-EVER WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE
                         ON MENTAL HEALTH         Automated Records Management System
                              June 7, 1999
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
Today, at the first-ever White House Conference on Mental Health, chaired by the President's
Mental Health Advisor Tipper Gore, the Clinton/Gore Administration will unveil unprecedented
measures to improve mental health. The Administration's proposals provide parity, improve
treatment, bolster research, and expand community responses to help those with mental illnesses"
Highlights of these initiatives include:

    Ensuring that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) -- the nation's
     largest private insurer - implements full mental health and substance abuse parity.
     Today, the Office of Personnel Management is sending a letter to the 285 participating health
     plans infonning them that starting next year they will have to offer full mental health and
     substance abuse parity to participate in the program. This step will provide full parity for nine
     million beneficiaries by next year and ensure that the Federal government leads the way to
     providing parity. The Department of Labor is also launching a new outreach campaign to
     infonn Americans about their rights under the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996.

    Launching national school safety training program for teachers and education
     personnel. The President announced a major nationwide pUblic/private partnership between
     the National Education Association (NEA), EchoStar, and other partners to improve school
     safety. The partnership, which includes the Departments of Education, Justice, and Health
     and Human Services, will create and run a comprehensive program that will be available at
     the beginning of the new school year with the goal of reaching every school across the
     country and providing training to teachers, school personnel, and community members on
     how to improve school safety.

    Accelerating progress in research. In July, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
     will launch a $7.3 million landmark study to detennine the nature of mental illness and
     treatment nationwide and to help guide strategies and policy for the next century. This new
     study will collect infonnation on mental illness, including the prevalence and duration of
     mental illness as well as the types of treatment that are most commonly used. NIMH also will
     announce the launch of two new clinical trials, investing a total of $61 million, to build on
     effective treatments for those affected by mental illness.

    Encouraging states to offer more coordinated Medicaid services for people with mental
     illness. Millions of Americans with severe mental illness rely on Medicaid to pay for their
     health care. To encourage states to make the most effective services available, the Health
     Care Financing Administration (HCFA) will advise all state Medicaid directors that: (1)
     Medicaid will reimburse for services provided in Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)
     programs targeting people with the most severe and persistent mental illness; (2) Medicaid
     recipients all have access to medications approved by FDA for the treatment of serious
     mental illnesses; and (3) states should educate Medicaid providers and beneficiaries about
     their ability to enter into "advance planning directives" that set out treatment guideline for
     people who became severely incapacitated in the future.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

   Launching a pilot program to help people with mental illness get the quality treatment
    they need to return to work. Ofthe 4.7 million Americans that receive Social Security
    Disability Insurance (SSDI), the Social Security Administration (SSA) estimates that
    approximately one in nine (about 500,000) has an affective disorder (such as depression or a
    bipolar disorder). Research suggests that many of the people suffering with these disorders
    could get effective treatment and perhaps return to work. The Administration will launch a
    new five-year, $10 million demonstration to provide treatment for ssm beneficiaries with
    affective disorders. This complements the Jeffords-Kennedy-Roth-Moynihan legislation,
    which allows people to buy into the Medicaid or Medicare program when they return to
    work.

   Educating older Americans and their health professionals about the risks of depression.
    Five million Americans over the age of 65 suffer from some form of depression, but many do
    not recognize their symptoms as depression and do not receive the treatment they need.
    NIMH and the Administration on Aging (AoA) will launch an outreach initiative to educate
    the elderly and their healthcare professionals about mental illness. The Department of
    Veteran Affairs will also launch six new study sites to test two modes of primary care for
    older Americans with mental health and/or substance abuse disorders.

   Reaching out to vulnerable homeless Americans with mental illnesses. The Department
    of Housing and Urban Development is launching a new initiative to encourage communities
    to create safe havens where homeless mentally ill Americans can get treatment and care.
    HHS will also launch a two-year, $4.8 million grant program to study the treatment, housing,
    education, training, and support services needed by homeless women and their children given
    to as many as 2,000 homeless mothers and their 4,000 children, many of whom suffer from
    mental illnesses. The Department of Veteran Affairs will double the number of "stand
    down" events to reach out to homeless Americans with mental illness to help them get the
    treatment and services they need.

   Implementing new strategies to meet the mental health needs of crime victims. To ensure
    that the federal response to community crises, like acts of terrorism or mass violence,
    includes a strong mental health component, the Administration is announcing a new
    interagency partnership between the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime and
    the Center for Mental Health Services within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
    Services Administration (SAMSHA). This partnership also will ensure that strategies are in
    place to address the mental health needs of victims of violent crime.

   Developing and implementing new strategies to address mental illness in the criminal
    justice system. SAMHSA and DOJ are hosting a conference later this summer to focus on
    how the criminal justice system can prevent crime by mentally ill people and can address the
    needs of offenders with mental illness. Following this conference, DOJ will launch an
    outreach effort to educate the criminal justice community on how to better serve people with
    mental health needs. This initiative will include a new partnership with the National GAINS
    center so that communities interested in pursuing these approaches can get technical'
    assistance and ideas about how to implement successful strategies.

   Implementing a new comprehensive approach to address combat stress in the military.
    At least 30 percent of those who have spent time in war zones experience combat stress

                                               2
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
    reaction. Today the President will direct the Department of Defense to report back within 180
    days on an implementation plan for a comprehensive combat stress program throughout the
    military. DOD will also hold a conference this fall to develop strategies and educate military
    leaders and medical personnel about the need to enhance current prevention strategies.

   Launching the expansion of the "Caring For Every Child" mental health campaign. At
    least one in ten American children and adolescents may have behavioral, or mental health
    problems. The Administration will launch a five-year $5 million dollar campaign in targeted
    communities to highlight the special mental health needs of children.

   Improving the mental health of Native American youth. The suicide rate for Native
    Americans between the ages of five and 24 years old is three times higher than the rest of the
    U.S. popUlation in this age group. This initiative allocates at least $5 million for a
    collaboration between the Departments of Interior, Justice, Education, and HHS, to go to ten
    Native American communities to develop effective strategies to address mental health needs
    of youth in settings such as the home, school, treatment centers, and the juvenile justice
    system.

   The Administration Also Challenged Congress to Pass Legislation to Improve Care and
    Services for People with Mental Illness. The Administration urged Congress to:
       ~ Pass the Jeffords-Kennedy-Roth-Moynihan-Lazio-Waxman-Bliley-Dingell
           legislation, which would enable people with disabilities to return to work by accessing
           affordable health insurance.
       ~ Hold hearings on the mental health parity law to review its strengths and weaknesses.
       ~ Fund the historic $70 million increase in the mental health grant.
       ~ Pass a strong enforceable patients' bill of rights which ensures that people with
           mental health needs obtain critical protections such as access to specialists and the
           continuity of care protections.
       ~ Pass strong comprehensive privacy and legislation to eliminate genetic
           discrimination.
