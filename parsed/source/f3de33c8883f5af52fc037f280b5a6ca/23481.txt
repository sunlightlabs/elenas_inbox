                    HATE CRIMES QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                                April 2, 1999

Q:   What is a hate crime?

A:   As a general matter, a hate crime is a crime that is motivated by bias based on the
     victim's race, color, religion, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability.
     However, it is important to understand that hate crimes are defined by various federal and
     state criminal statutes, and these statutory definitions differ in their particulars from
     jurisdiction to jurisdiction. A principal federal hate crimes statute, for example, is
     currently limited to acts of violence committed because of the victim's race, color,
     religion or national origin; it does not include crimes committed because of the victim's
     gender, sexual orientation, or disability.

Q:   What did the President announce today?

A:   Today President Clinton applauded public and private efforts to teach children about
     tolerance and urged Congress to quickly pass the pending federal hate crimes legislation.
     This legislation strengthens the existing federal hate crimes law by (1) extending the
     situations where prosecutions can be brought for violent crimes motivated by bias based
     on race, color, religion, or national origin; and (2) expanding the federal hate crimes
     statute to protect against hate crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability.
     The President also announced a new public-private partnership which will focus attention
     on issues of hate, tolerance, and diversity in middle-grade schools. Finally, the President
     called on the Departments of Justice and Education to include hate crimes in its annual
     report card on school safety and to report on hate crimes and bias on college campuses.

Q:   What did the President announce with respect to a new public-private partnership?

A:   The President announced a public-private partnership that will develop a program for
     middle-school students to teach tolerance in the classroom and in their daily lives. The
     members of the partnership are AT&T, Court TV, the National Middle School
     Association, the Anti-Defamation League, and Cable in the Classroom, with assistance
     from the Departments of Justice and Education. This effort is supported by the NAACP,
     the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights, the National Council of La Raza, the
     National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, the National Association of
     Protection and Advocacy Systems, the National Education Association, and the National
     School Boards Association, and the Partnership expects support from other organizations
     that deal with these issues. Recognizing that tolerance cannot be taught in a single day
     and that raising awareness of diversity should be integrated into students' daily lives, this
     public-private partnership -- entitled "Dealing with Our Differences" -- will provide an
     opportunity for middle-school students to learn about the harmful impact of intolerance,
     and will highlight positive ways that young adolescents are dealing with diversity issues.

       The Partnership will develop in-school lessons and activities supported with cable TV
       programming; videos and websites; a nationally-televised forum on diversity and
       tolerance at the end of October; and post-show lessons and activities. This partnership
       builds on previous Administration efforts such as issuing the following publications:
       "Preventing Youth Hate Crime: A Manual for Schools and Communities;" "Healing the
       Hate: A National Bias Crime Prevention Curriculum for Middle Schools;" and
       "Protecting Students from Harassment and Hate Crime."

Q:     What specific changes to current federal law is the President supporting?

A:     The President supports pending federal legislation to expand the principal federal hate
       crimes statute. The current statute prohibits any acts of violence that are based on a
       person's race, color, religion, or national origin and that are intended to interfere with
       certain specified federally protected activities. The proposed legislation would make
       illegal these acts of violence even if they were not intended to interfere with federally
       protected activities. Further, the proposed legislation would prohibit any acts of violence
       based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability, as long as there is a connection with
       interstate commerce.

Q:     How many hate crimes are there each year? Are hate crimes increasing?

A:     In 1997, there were 8049 reported incidents of hate crimes. But these statistics almost
       certainly under-report hate crimes to a significant extent, and the rise in the number of
       reported incidents may be due to improvements in reporting, rather than to increases in
       crime. There are two reasons for thinking that current statistics under-report hate crime.
       First and most important, submission of hate crimes data to the FBI is voluntary, and
       many law enforcement agencies do not submit data at all or submit incomplete data. In
       addition, many victims of hate crimes fail to report the incidents because of fear,
       humiliation, or language difficulties. For example, 60% of the victims of anti-gay
       incidents who reported their incidents to private tracking groups did not report the
       incidents to the police, in many cases because of a fear of mistreatment or unwanted
       exposure.

Q:      What other activities has the Administration undertaken with respect to hate
        crimes?

A:      At the White House Conference on Hate Crimes in November 1997, the President
        announced several initiatives to ensure effective law enforcement, including the creation
        of working groups in every U.S. Attorney's district in the country to improve
        coordination among local, state, and federal prosecutors; the addition of new FBI agents
        and prosecutors to work on enforcement of hate crimes laws; and the development of
        model curriculum for training law enforcement officers to deal with hate crimes. Since
        the conference, the Administration has committed significant resources to assisting
        enforcement of hate crimes and has issued publications such as "Preventing Youth Hate
        Crime: A Manual for Schools and Communities" and "Protecting Students from
        Harassment and Hate Crime." In his FY2000 budget, the President has requested
        approximately $34 million for hate crimes enforcement.

Q:      What is the Administration doing about hate on the Internet?

A:       It is important to distinguish between hate crime and hate speech. Speech on the Internet
         is protected by the Constitution. The Clinton Administration is not regulating the
         Internet. However, there are many organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League
         that are working on developing programs for use by parents to be able to protect their
         children by filtering out hate sites. Where crimes motivated by bias happen on the
         Internet, such as e-mail threats, they have and will be prosecuted.

Q:       Why isn't the President increasing penalties for hate crimes?

A:      The Clinton Administration has already increased penalties for hate crimes in the
        Sentencing Enhancement Act, passed as part of the 1994 crime bill, which authorizes the
        imposition of enhanced sentences for federal crimes found to have been motivated by

      race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. The Act
      became effective in November 1995.
Proposed Legislation

Q:     Why is this legislation needed?

A:     The legislation is needed for two compelling reasons. First, the problem of hate crimes
       based on sexual orientation, disability, and gender are serious, and are currently not
       covered under federal law. Second, the Department of Justice has been hindered in its
       efforts to prosecute racial hate crimes because of the need to show that the victim was
       attacked because he or she was engaging in a federally protected activity such as enrolling
       in or attending any public school or college. This amendment will ensure that all persons
       in the United States are protected under federal law from any hate crimes causing serious
       bodily injury.

Q:     Why is federal hate crimes legislation necessary at all?           Shouldn't this really be a
       matter for local prosecutors?

A:     The federal government has an important supporting role to play in prosecuting hate
       crimes. As a matter oflongstanding practice, federal officials defer to state prosecutors
       to make the initial determination whether to bring a hate crimes case. But the problem of
       hate crimes is serious enough to warrant providing the federal government with authority
       to act if federal jurisdiction is necessary to achieve justice in a particular case. And the
       proposed legislation will ensure that the federal government has this necessary authority.

Q:     Won't this expansion of the new federal hate crimes statute require extra resources?

A:     Any new criminal law requires new resources to enforce it, and this one is no
       exception. The Administration will work to ensure that its new responsibilities are
       carried out as efficiently as possible.

Q:     Doesn't providing protections based on sexual orientation legitimize the gay
       lifestyle?

A:     No. Whatever their views about homosexuality or about providing antidiscrimination
       protections to gays and lesbians, all people of good will should agree that people should
       not be subject to physical attack based on their sexual orientation. People in this country
       have a fundamental right to be safe and to live without fear of violence. This statute
       ensures that people will receive this protection.

Q:      Won't the addition of gender to the federal hate crimes legislation federalize all
        rapes?

                                            Hex-Dump COil version .

A:   No. The bill does not make every rape a federal crime. In addition to the violent act,
     there must be evidence of bias toward the victim because of the victim's gender and a
     sufficient connection with interstate commerce. The Act generally would not be used
     when state laws provide severe penalties, as in cases of rape. The more frequent use
     would be in cases of violent attacks against women where there is clear evidence of
     gender bias but state laws do not provide sufficient penalties or where state officials
     conclude it is difficult to bring a successful state prosecution. In addition, federal
     jurisdiction would also allow federal authorities to assist states in bringing their own
     cases.
