  morning. The attached is the actual press paper that will go out later
  today.  You can educate yourselves about where we are by referring to it.
  PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE this paper outside of the White House, however,
  until at least Raines, et. al., brief the press at 1:30 p.m.

                      PRESIDENT CLINTON USES LINE-ITEM VETO
                      ON DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 1998

                                         October 14, 1997


        President Clinton used the line-item veto today to cancel 13 projects in the Defense
         Appropriations Act of 1998.

        The President's action will save $144 million in budget authority in 1998.

        The Defense Appropriations Act included funding for over 750 projects, costing about
         $11 billion, that the President did not request in his 1998 budget.

                -- The Administration carefully reviewed those unrequested projects and found
                that while most ofthem have merit, some do not.      .

        The Administration has chosen criteria that are appropriate to each appropriations bill
         under review.

        For the Defense Appropriations Act, the President considered such factors as:

                -- whether he requested the projects in his 1998 budget,

                - whether they contribute to our national security, and

                - whether they fit with our long-range defense plans.

        The President's action will in no way adversely affect our military capability, the
         readiness of our forces, or their operations in defense of our Nation.

                -- The Defense Department has determined there is no national security
                requirement for these projects.

        The President left thousands of projects in the bill, including the vast majority that
         Congress added, reflecting his commitment to the military readiness of American forces
         and Congress' role in shaping appropriations bills.

                -- In fact, his actions mean that he has agreed to a net addition of about $1 billion
                in Defense Department funding above the level in the Bipartisan Budget
                Agreement.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
                            THE LINE ITEM VETO ACT


o   Scope of Authority. President may cancel any item of discretionary or direct
    spending or any limited tax benefit, if he sends a special message to Congress
    identifying the item within 5 days (excluding Sundays) of signing the bill
    containing the item.

o Cancellations transmitted to Congress are effective upon receipt by Congress,
  and remain effective unless overturned by a disapproval law.

o The item veto may only be used on items in bills the President signs -he may not
  veto items that become law without his signature.

o   Defmition of Item. The President may cancel (not reduce) whole individual
    "items" of discretionary spending -defmed as any dollar amount in an
    appropriations bill or report, or any amount required to be allocated by a
    specific proviso in a bill or represented separately in explanatory text in a
    report.

o   President may cancel only the amount of spending -not conditions or
    restrictions on spending.

o The President may also cancel any "item of new direct spending" -defmed as a
  specific provision of law estimated to result in an increase in direct spending,
  relative to the baseline.

o   Limited Tax Benefits. "Limited tax benefits" that may be canceled include only
    revenue-losing provisions applying to 100 or fewer beneficiaries in a fiscal year
    (where the beneficiaries are not similarly treated), or transitional relief to 10 or
    fewer beneficiaries. Congress may specify in tax legislation whether the bill
    contains any provisions subject to cancellation authority.

o   Lockbox.    Includes a "Iockbox" mechanism:        discretionary cancellations
    trigger automatic cap reductions, and paygo savings from cancellations are not
    put on paygo scorecard.

o Con!!ressional orocedure. The Congress has 30 session days following a
  cancellation message to consider disapproval legislation, under expedited
  procedures.

o   Disapproval bills introduced in the House must disapprove all cancellations
    made with respect to a particular law. Bills introduced in the Senate may select
    particular cancellations. However, the bills may be amended in both chambers
    to alter the list of cancellations.

    will sunset on January 1,2005.

on Objects, Purposes, and Programs: The President's FY 1998 Budget supports
ongoing work to demonstrate and export new environmentally acceptable
technology to the industrial base and to train the industrial base on the use of new
technology. The appropriated increase would support life-cycle environmental and
manufacturing technologies research specifically related to weapons systems and
munitions technology assessment and analysis. The Army does not believe this
additional research merits funding at this time.

1(D). Estimated Fiscal, Economic, and Budgetary Effect of Cancellation: As a
result of the cancellation, Federal outlays will not increase, as specified below. This
will have a commensurate effect on the Federal budget deficit and, to that extent,

            Report Pursuant to the Line Item Veto Act, P.L. 104-130

Bill Citation: "Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1998" (H.R. 2266)

I(A). Dollar Amount of Discretionary Budget Authority: $3,000 thousand for a
Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Navy project for "COTS airgun as an
acoustic source" on page 120 of House Report 105-265 dated September 23,1997.

1(B). Determinations: This cancellation will reduce the Federal budget deficit, will not
impair any essential Government functions, and will not hann the national interest.

I(C),(E). Reasons for Cancellation; Facts, Circumstances, and Considerations
Relating to or Bearing upon the Cancellation; and Estimated Effect of Cancellation
on Objects, Purposes, and Programs: This project would continue development,
testing, and calibration of components for a mobile, high power broadband acoustic
surveillance source that is based upon the adaptation of commercial air-gun technology.
Technical review in the Department of Defense has concluded that this technology will
not be effective, except in shallow water regions where there are no current requirements.
 The project is being canceled because it was not requested in the President's FY 1998
Budget and the Department of Defense has determined that it would not make a
significant contribution to US military capability.

1(D). Estimated Fiscal, Economic, and Budgetary Effect of Cancellation: As a
result of the cancellation, Federal outlays will not increase, as specified below. This will
have a commensurate effect on the Federal budget deficit and, to that extent, will have a
beneficial effect on the economy.

not impair any essential Government functions, and will not harm the national
interest.

I(C),(E). Reasons for Cancellation; Facts, Circumstances, and Considerations
Relating to or Bearing upon the Cancellation; and Estimated Effect of Cancellation
on Objects, Purposes, and Programs: This project would fund research into
hypersonic technologies and is intended to complement NASA's reusable launch
vehicle program. However, NASA, not the Department of Defense, is responsible
for the development of reusable launch vehicles. The project is being canceled
because it was not requested in the President's FY 1998 Budget, and because the
Department of Defense has determined that it would not make a significant
contribution to US military capability.

l(C),(E). Reasons for Cancellation; Facts, Circumstances, and Considerations
Relating to or Bearing upon the Cancellation; and Estimated Effect of Cancellation
on Objects, Purposes, and Programs: This project would test and demonstrate
microelectronics for acquisition tracking and intercept of an asteroid in space using
a mothership integrated with three microsatellites. The scientific objective of the
mission is to obtain data on the asteroid. The project's key military application
would be for space-based missile defense. The project is being canceled because it
was not requested in the President's FY 1998 Budget; it was not in the Department
of Defense Future Years Defense Plan; and its key military application is not part of
the Department's national missile defense readiness plan.

1(D). Estimated Fiscal, Economic, and Budgetary Effect of Cancellation: As a
