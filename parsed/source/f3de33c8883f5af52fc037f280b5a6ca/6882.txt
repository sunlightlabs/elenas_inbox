                        McCain Tobacco Bills Leaves Room for Improvement

    Enacting comprehensive tobacco legislation to dramatically reduce youth smoking is our most
    urgent public health priority, and Senator McCain's leadership increases our chances of enacting
    strong legislation this year. His bill provides a solid foundation for further action, but leaves
    room for improvement. In particular, comprehensive tobacco legislation should include:

    Strong Penalties for Companies Missing Youth Smoking Targets

          It is critically important that individual companies have financial incentives to meet the
           youth smoking reduction targets. This means that a company that misses the youth
           smoking targets by 40 percent will pay a higher penalty than a company that misses by 10
           percent.

          Industry-wide penalties, while important, are not a substitute for company specific
           penalties. Since industry penalties are imposed on all firms at once, companies can pass
           them on to consumers, raising. the price of cigarettes more -- which will help to reduce
           youth smoking, but won't provide companies with a financial incentive to do more to
           reduce youth smoking.

          Reducing youth smoking is our bottom line and we must make it the industries' bottom
           line -- that is why we need company specific penalties.

    National Environmental Tobacco Smoke Standards

          Progress toward other public health goals should include limiting exposure to
           environmental tobacco smoke in work sites and public places.

          We have serious concerns about this bill's provision which would allow individual States
           to "opt out" of the national smoke-free environment policy. This undermines and
           significantly weakens the national ETS standard by creating a patchwork system where
           states could decide to adopt weaker laws or decide against taking any action, leaving
           people with little or no protections from the hazards of environmental tobacco smoke.

    No Anti-Trust Exemption

          There is no need to exempt the tobacco industry from anti-trust rules in order to reduce
           youth smoking. We strongly oppose any exemptions that would allow price fixing
           agreements.

                                                                         ,       Hex-Dump Conversion
    Public Health Spending

    It is critical that any tobacco legislation include core public health investments in his bill,
    including funding for: .

          National, state, community and school-based prevention and education efforts;

           Counteradvertising;

           Youth smoking data collection;

           Research through the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the
            Centers for Disease Control, and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.

    Assistance for Children

    In addition to funding public health efforts, tobacco revenues should be targetted at efforts to
    assist children, including the President's proposals to:

           Double the number of working families who receive child care, and significantly
            increasing the number of students receiving after school care;

           Reduce class size by hiring 100,000 additional teachers;

           Funding Medicaid outreach efforts to ensure all children eligible for Medicaid health care
            coverage receive it.

    The President's Five Principles

    President Clinton has said he will only support tobacco legislation that:

           Raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over 5 years and $1.50 a pack over the
            next ten years, and impose tough penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids;

           Affirms the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;

           Gets companies out of the business of marketing and selling tobacco to minors.

           Promotes public health research and public health goals; and

           Protects our tobacco farmers and their communities.

    If we act now, we can reduce the number of youths smoking by 3 million between now and 2003
    -- and most importantly help us avoid approximately 1 million premature deaths.
