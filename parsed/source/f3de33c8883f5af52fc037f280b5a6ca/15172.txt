TEXT:
Ann Lewis has apparently signed off on these talking points for our
general use in connection with the Summit. They look basically good to
me, but I thought you might be int'erested. I just told Eli that he should
highlight "reading tutors" in his bullet listing the great things
AmeriCorps does, along with a few more minor comments.

   TALKING POINTS ON THE PRESIDENTS' SUMMIT FOR SERVICE AND THE
    CLINTON'S ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO CITIZEN SERVICE
                        Thursday, April 10, 1997

        "The era of big government may be over, but the era ofbig challenges for our nation is
surely not. Citizen service is the main way we recognize that we are responsible for one
another. It is the very American idea that we meet our challenges not through heavy-handed
government or as isolated individuals, but as members ofa true community, with all of us
working together. "
                                             -- President William J. Clinton, April 5, 1997

       Service as a path to good citizenship. The President believes that citizen service is
not only an effective answer to a community's problems, it is also an important part of
every young person's civic education -- their sense of responsibility for themselves, our
community, and our nation. Those who serve gain a greater understanding of their
communities and neighbors. In many ways, they learn what it truly means to be an
American.

        Engaging young people in service through AmeriCorps. While today's challenges
require something of all of us, it is especially important that young people take leading
roles in shaping their own futures, and gain the sense of citizenship that service helps to
provide. That is why the President created AmeriCorps. It is also an important reason
for the Service Summit's focus on young people.

       AmeriCorps: the basic bargain of opportunity and responsibility. The President
often says that one of his proudest moments was creating the Corporation for National
Service and AmeriCorps. During the last three years, 50,000 young AmeriCorps participants
have earned college tuition by serving their communities, with the basic bargain of getting the
opportunity to go to college in return for giving something back to their friends and neighbors.

        AmeriCorps: reviving the spirit of service in America. The success of AmeriCorps
shows that service can help to meet our most pressing social needs, from renewing our cities to
protecting our environment, from immunizing poor children to giving them mentors and
someone to look up to. That service often leads to more service -- a typical AmeriCorps
member trains or recruits a dozen or more community volunteers. AmeriCorps - and even
larger numbers of Senior Service Corps and student volunteers - have helped revive the spirit
of service in America.

        The Presidents' Summit: mobilizing citizen power. From April 27-29, in
Independence Hall in Philadelphia, President Clinton and President Bush and will convene
the first Presidents' Summit On Citizen Service, with the support and leadership of the
Corporation For National Service and AmeriCorps, the Points Of Light Foundation,
Summit Chairman General Colin Powell and Vice Chairs Henry Cisneros and Lynda
Robb. The Summit's goal, like that of AmeriCorps, is to mobilize America's citizen power
into a united effort to solve our common problems - especially those that threaten our
                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
young people.

        Participation from all sectors of society. Leaders from a broad spectrum will come
to the Summit with commitments in hand, concrete pledges of support and volunteers to
solve their local problems. In preparation for the summit some of our most prominent
corporations and service organizations have already stepped forward.

       An unprecedented bipartisan Summit. Every living former President will attend or
send a representative. We hope this will serve as an example that there are common
national values that unite us all. The idea of service is such a value.

        A special focus on children, to help prepare them for the 21st Century. No task
facing is more crucial than preparing our children for the future. To do that, we must
help our children and families overcome the challenges of society today: the burdens of
illiteracy and poor health, the lure of tobacco, alcohol and drugs; the need to acquire the
tools to succeed in a global economy. That is why the Summit will have a special emphasis on
service aimed at America's children.

       In preparation for the Summit, the President has already:

     Announced a new National Week of Service (April 14-20), with AmeriCorps and Peace
      Corps alumni engaging young people in service across the country;
     Called on all states to make service a part of high school and middle school education;
     Launched his National Service Scholarships, offering $1,000 scholarships (half provided
      by the government, half by local civic &Toups and businesses) to help students who
      perform outstanding service pay for college;
     Highlighted a recent Brandeis study that shows that when you begin to serve at a young
      age, schoolwork improves and there is a good chance you will keep serving in years to
      come.

      In the coming weeks before the Summit, the President will:

     Recognize service and volunteers working for children at the White House Early
      Childhood Conference on April 17;
     Recognize service, volunteers, and public-private partnerships on Net Day, on April 19;
     Play major role at the Presidents' Service Summit in Philadelphia, which he will attend
      from April 27-28. (The Vice President, the First Lady, and Mrs. Gore will also attend.)
