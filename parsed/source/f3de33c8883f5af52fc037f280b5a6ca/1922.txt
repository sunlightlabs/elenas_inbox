TEXT:
Last week we discussed that we should continue with efforts to get a visit
to an urban turnaround high school -- preferably DeWitt Clinton High
School -- on the President's schedule.   Tonight I spoke with Jennifer
Palmieri.   She said that the 4th commencement speech -- which had been
targeted for a Western university, on racial reconciliation -- was still
up in the air because of difficulty in finding the proper venue (the main
options are 3 UC schools, none of which is ideal) .   She agreed that it
would be good to do a turnaround school, and to do so this Spring, but
June 25th (the day of DeWitt Clinton's graduation) is a problem because
the POTUS is scheduled to be at the VP's conference in TN that day, and
they have already moved this once.    However, as she recalled, DeWitt
Clinton has indicated that it is willing to move its date if the POTUS
would come.   Palmieri said that we can discuss the turnaround option again
at the next commencement meeting, probably Thursday.

As we had discussed, I have prepared a draft memo (attached), all or part
of which could be circulated to others in advance of Thursday's meeting,
that argues for the need to do a turnaround school in general and plugs
DeWitt Clinton in particular.   Would it be helpful for somebody (Bruce,
Elena?) to circulate something like this, or maybe shorter? Please let me
know if there'S something more I should do to follow up.

MEMORANDUM FOR

FROM:

SUBJECT:              Commencement Address at an Urban Turnaround School

Thus far, there are plans for the President to deliver three commencement addresses: Morgan
State; West Point; and Sidwell Friends. There is also interest in having the President deliver a
fourth speech, concerning themes of racial reconciliation, in a West Coast commencement. We
urge that a fifth site should be added to the slate, whether billed as a part of the commencement
series, or as a free-standing event. The President should visit a once-troubled public high school
that has recently made dramatic strides, embodying some of the key principles of our education
agenda: high standards, better teaching, greater discipline, more parental involvement. Visiting
such a "turnaround school" could send a powerful message that high standards can yield greater
student achievement in a diverse, challenging urban setting, not just comfortable white suburbs.
It could also provide an opportunity to reinforce the message of racial reconciliation.

Adding a turnaround school graduation to the President's calendar is critical for several reasons:

      The President's initiative on national standards will only succeed if it is firmly embraced
       by our nation's urban schools. However, many urban teachers, administrators and
       parents view the standards movement warily, concerned that adopting higher standards
       and testing for performance can only set up their children--and their schools--for failure.
       Focusing national attention on a real urban high school that is beginning to see the results
       from higher standards could build on next month's Education Town Hall to help urban
       parents and educators understand why the President passionately believes that all students
       can do better if we ask them to.

      Another potential threat to the President's standards initiative is the risk of test-related
       litigation. Mike Smith, Mike Cohen, and others have been meeting with the civil rights
       community to try to address concerns that they have expressed about the national reading
       and math tests. However, we are far more likely to succeed the more the President can
       communicate that this is an achievement initiative that will benefit minority groups,
       rather than a pure testing initiative that will penalize them. Showing that standards have
       worked in a predominantly minority school would help get this across.

      Many parents, businesspeople, legislators and others are on the verge of concluding that
       urban public schools are beyond salvation, that there is nothing we can do to make them
       safe and educationally sound. This cynical attitude feeds public sentiment for vouchers
       and other quick fixes, rather than supporting the more complicated, long-term task of
       reform the public schools that serve 90% of students. Visiting a turnaround school
       conveys that if we raise standards, get parents more involved, and pay attention to the
       basics, we can make our urban public schools safe centers of learning.


                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
        that as the President has embarked on his campaign to raise standards across the nation,
        he will have elected to visit two of the more exclusive schools in the country (the North
        Shore high school from the First in the World consortium and Sidwell) without setting
        foot in an urban high school. Visiting a turnaround school to discuss higher standards
        would show that the President is in tune with the needs and challenges of our urban
        public schools.

  These considerations should be addressed now, before the end of the current school year. Ifwe
  delay until this fall, there is a serious danger that negative impressions will have had too much
. time to harden.

If, as we recommend, the President were to visit a turnaround school, our top choice would be
DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. This school has a graduation date of June 25, but has
expressed a willingness to adjust to accommodate a Presidential visit.

       Dramatic turnaround story in a large, highly ethnically diverse high school. Identified
        seven years ago as a low-achieving school by New York State, with low attendance and
        high dropout rates. The formerly all-male school raised expectations (expanded AP
        program, eliminated all non-Regents level courses, and tripled the number of students
        moving on from Limited English Proficient program), and substantially increased
        parental involvement.

       Dropout rates and attendance have dramatically improved, and far more students are
        taking and passing rigorous regents exams (although the total receiving Regents diplomas
        is still under 20%).

       Selected by Redbook magazine in 1996 as one of the five most improved high schools in
        the nation, and given a high rating for performance from New York Times.

       The school is celebrating its Centennial this year.

       Distinguished alumni including Daniel Schor, Bernard Kalb, A.M. Rosenthal, Neil
        Simon, Richard Rodgers, James Baldwin, Ralph Lauren, Fats Waller, Garry Marshall and
        Burt Lancaster. Press interest in a Presidential visit to DeWitt Clinton would likely be
        high.

       The President has expressed a general interest in going to the Bronx.

Other possibilities for visiting a turnaround school would include:

       Patterson High School, Baltimore, Maryland -- Formerly one of the lowest-achieving
        schools in the state, the school reorganized into smaller five schools within schools
        (including four career academies in the upper grades), allowing closer ties with caring
        adults and improved safety, discipline, and student performance.


                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion




           West Mecklenburg High School, Charlotte, North Carolina -- Within a two year period
            the school raised its test scores, increased parental involvement, and had a 75% increase
            in students making the honor rolL It also reduced violence and the number of weapons
            at schooL

     Again, we think adding a turnaround school to the schedule for this spring is of tremendous
     importance to the President's education agenda; waiting for next fall would be too late. If there
     is support for this general concept, but additional options are necessary, we would be happy to
     ask the Education Department for an expanded list of candidates.
