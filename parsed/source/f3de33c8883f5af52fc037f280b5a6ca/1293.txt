REBUILDING AMERICA



America's prosperity and quality oflife are linked to our transportation system's efficiency,
which keeps production costs low and maintains our international competitiveness. When
President Clinton promised to "rebuild America" five years ago, this system suffered from
inadequate capacity, deteriorating infrastructure, and poor connections among different forms of
transportation. The President has worked with Congress to make good on his promise, taking
advantage ofISTEA to raise infrastructure investment to record levels.

ISTEA SUCCESSES

       Under President Clinton, federal transportation infrastructure investment increased 21
       percent, to an average of $25.5 billion annually.

       Many indicators of highway conditions and performance have stabilized or improved.
       The condition of bridges and highway pavement, which had been deteriorating, has
       stabilized. We have kept pace with our transportation system's maintenance
       requirements and stopped its deterioration.

       Transit investment has increased, including over $3 billion transferred using ISTEA's
       flexible funding provisions. Nearly 26,000 new buses and nearly 600 new rail cars have
       been bought for state and local transit agencies, and more than 100 miles of new transit
       lines serving more than 100 new stations are under construction. Transit speeds have
       improved by an average of about 10 percent.

KEY NEXTEA PROVISIONS

      NEXTEA builds on ISTEA's successes while helping us to move towards a balanced
       budget. It would authorize about $175 billion for surface transportation programs from
       1998 through 2003, an 11 percent increase over ISTEA. The proposed authorization
       levels would sustain or expand core programs such as the National Highway System,
       maintenance of the Interstate Highways, bridge reconstruction, and mass transit.

      NEXTEA gives state and local officials greater flexibility to target funds towards projects
       that best meet community needs, including Amtrak and intercity rail passenger facilities.
       It also increases the tools available to them by making intelligent transportation systems
       eligible under all major program categories and by expanding innovative finance
       strategies to cut red tape and to leverage private and nonfederal public resources.




                                                4
                                                                    ltex~~~~Tl



A          COMMITMENT TO SAFETY
More than 40,000 Americans die and three million are injured in motor vehicle crashes each
year, inflicting a tragic toll on millions offamilies. In addition, these crashes cost our economy
$150 billion annually, including $14 billion paid directly by taxpayers for expenses such as
health care and emergency services. Improved safety can help to control these costs.

ISTEA SUCCESSES

       Under ISTEA, with its enhanced commitment to safety, highway fatalities have been
       lower than in decades, averaging about 41,000 annually. Safety belt use has grown from
       11 percent of motorists in 1982 to 68 percent last year. Alcohol-related fatalities have
       decreased from 57 percent of crashes in 1982 to 41 percent in 1995.

KEY NEXTEA PROVISIONS

Our challenge is to continue the progress on safety even as traffic increases. Recently, we have
seen warning signs that we may be approaching the limits of progress under ISTEA: the fatality
rate has stagnated, increases in safety belt use have leveled off, and the number of alcohol-related
deaths has increased. NEXTEA would attack these problems by focusing on three key areas:
driver behavior, road design, and vehicle standards.

       Safer Drivers

      NEXTEA would increase NHTSA safety funding by 11 percent to $333 million, and fund
       incentive programs to reduce drugged and drunken driving, to increase safety belt use,
       and to collect improved data on highway safety to better identify and solve safety
       problems.

      $9 million annually in financial incentives would be provided for states to increase proper
       use of safety belts and child restraints.

      NEXTEA would increase funding for drunk driving prevention by 60 percent to $40
       million in 1998, and reward states for aggressively reducing drunk driving through
       administrative driver's license suspensions and revocations, programs to prevent minors
       from drinking, and effective sanctions for repeat offenders.



      NEXTEA would provide $5 million annually beginning in 1999 in grants to states to

                                                 5
                                                                         Hex4)lllhp CtJilYel'8lon
    prevent drugged driving. A state would be eligible for these grants if it adopted five of
    nine countermeasures, including zero tolerance laws, administrative license suspension
    for those driving under the influence, and pre-license drug testing.

    Safer Roads

   Under ISTEA, funding was set aside to eliminate road hazards and to make highway-rail
    grade crossings safer. Grade crossing deaths alone have dropped by 31 percent.
    NEXTEA would build on this progress by replacing this set-aside with a flexible,
    six-year, $3.2 billion Infrastructure Safety Program. States would now have the ability to
    transfer funds to enforcement and behavioral programs if they would have a greater
    impact on safety.

    Safer Vehicles

   States would have increased flexibility for tougher enforcement, such as targeting
    shippers who encourage truckers to violate rules and increasing penalties for violators.
    States also would be reimbursed for border enforcement and other high-priority activities
    that improve trucking safety.

   Under NEXTEA, the freeze on the size and weight of larger combination trucks on
    Interstate Highways and other routes would continue. We are doing a comprehensive
    study of this and related issues, and may soon propose additional steps in future safety
    legislation.

   Much progress on safety has been the result of vehicle design aimed at protecting
    motorists in crashes. NEXTEA would build on the progress to date with a $45 million
    annual research program targeted at improving crash avoidance and crash worthiness. In
    addition, more than a third of intelligent transportation systems research would be
    focused on collision avoidance systems and other "smart vehicle" technologies that
    prevent crashes.

   A new focus on performance in safety programs would measure effectiveness by looking
    at qua~tifiable results, not at how much money or effort is put into solutions.

                                                                              Hex톞lwnp Converslon
INCREASING INVESTMENT THROUGH INNOVATIVE FINANCING



In spite ofISTEA's record investment, the federal government alone cannot meet all of our
infrastructure. needs. President Clinton recognized this in his January 1994 Executive Order on
infrastructure, in which he directed us to cut red tape to speed construction and supplement
federal funds by leveraging private and nonfederal public investment.

ISTEA SUCCESSES

       President Clinton's Partnership for Transportation Investment accelerated 74 projects
       worth $4.5 billion, including $1.2 billion in investment beyond that available through
       conventional financing. Projects are advancing an average of two years ahead of
       schedule, saving interest and inflation costs.

       Some innovative finance initiatives also advance other national priorities, such as in
       Missouri and Arizona, where entrepreneurs were given permission to install fiber optic
       cable within highway rights-of-way in return for reserving part of the cable as the
       backbone of statewide intelligent transportation systems.

       The new State Infrastructure Bank program uses federal seed money to leverage private
       and nonfederal public funds in 10 pilot states. Among the proposed uses of these funds
       are: a loan to start construction on a highway interchange without waiting for the full
       federal funding to be accumulated; a loan to finance a toll road's interest costs while it is
       being built, before revenues can begin to pay off the construction debt; and a loan to buy
       new light rail vehicles.

       We provided a direct loan to California's Alameda Corridor, which will speed shipping
       from Los Angeles' port by creating a dedicated freight rail corridor. We also provided
       standby lines of credit to secure private financing for California toll roads; at a cost of just
       $18 million, we supported $2.5 billion in construction financing

KEY NEXTEA PROVISIONS

      NEXTEA would open the State Infrastructure Bank program to all states, increase the
       federal seed money dedicated to these banks, and allow states to use up to 10 percent of
       their regular federal-aid highway funds to capitalize their banks.

      $100 million annually would be dedicated to help leverage nonfederal public resources
       for projects of national significance, such as interstate trade corridors.

ENSURING GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS



Under President Clinton, America is once again the most economically-competitive nation in the
world and its leading exporter, and this is due in great measure to the reliability and low costs of
our transportation system. In an increasingly-global economy, keeping transportation efficient is
crucial to our continued competitiveness and to taking advantage of the markets opened by
NAFTA and GATT.

ISTEA SUCCESSES

       Seamless connections among different forms of transportation, such as between trucks,
       railroads, and seaports, are important for efficiency, and ISTEA-funded projects are
       making possible these connections. These projects include truck-rail freight transfer
       facilities in Stark County, Ohio, and Auburn, Maine, and projects in Portland, Oregon and
       Seattle designed to improve rail and truck access to seaports.

       Projects such as the Red Hook barge transfer, which daily takes hundreds of trucks off
       New York's crowded streets, often have important social and environmental benefits, and
       ISTEA made them eligible for funding through such flexible initiatives as the Congestion
       Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program and our innovative finance programs.

KEY NEXTEA PROVISIONS

      NEXTEA would facilitate trade by creating new programs to improve border crossings
       and develop major trade corridors within the U.S., cutting congestion and eliminating
       bottlenecks.

      NEXTEA would support projects of national significance, such as those focused on trade
       corridors, through dedicated funds and by expanding the State Infrastructure Bank
       program.

      The proposal would expand funding eligibility to include access to intermodal terminals
       and water ports. This is a vital change since much international trade -- 98 percent by
       weight, 50 percent by value -- is shipped through ports. These programs also would
       make eligible for funding Amtrak and intercity rail passenger and public freight facilities
       and intelligent transportation systems projects, which can improve the logistics crucial to
       "just-in-time" deliveries.

IMPROVING ACCESS TO JOBS AND TRAINING



One of the biggest barriers faced by those moving from welfare rolls to payrolls is finding
transportation to jobs, training, and support services such as day care. Poverty and welfare
eligibility rules mean that few welfare recipients own cars, and public transit often provides
inadequate connections to job and training centers. This problem is becoming more serious,
since two-thirds of new jobs are in suburbs. To support his comprehensive welfare reform
initiative, President Clinton proposes to build on existing transit programs that work with
innovative approaches to helping people make the transition to the working world.

ISTEA SUCCESSES

       Our Livable Communities program integrates transit with jobs, schools, and housing. In
       Corpus Christi, local residents worked with local officials on developing three bus
       transfer centers and improving pedestrian access to local amenities, and a Los Angeles
       neighborhood initiative generated a hundred new jobs and helped to cut crime by 19
       percent.

       The 10blinks program provides transportation and training in both urban and rural areas.
       Oregon's Glendale-Azalea School District used 10blinks funds to transport 400
       unemployed and undereducated residents to training and to jobs in the first year alone.
       The success of initiatives such as 10blinks and Livable Communities provides a model for
       new efforts to improve community access to jobs and other necessities.

KEY NEXTEA PROVISIONS

      NEXTEA includes a six-year, $600 million grant program to support flexible, innovative
       transportation alternatives, such as vanpools, to get people to where the jobs are.
       Funding would also provide access to training centers and to support services such as day
       care at transit links. This program would be closely coordinated with other human
       services assistance that would be provided to states and localities working to meet the
       special needs of the welfare population.

      Since transportation and construction jobs are among America's best-paying, we want to
       open opportunities in these fields for welfare recipients and other disadvantaged people.
       NEXTEA would increase incentives for states and localities to provide job training in
       conjunction with federally-funded technology and construction projects, and to enable
       them to offer hiring preferences to welfare recipients and residents of Empowerment
       Zones and Enterprise Communities.

PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT



Scientific research demonstrates the effects of pollution on our health and on the ecological
systems which sustain human life. President Clinton has taken advantage ofISTEA's landmark
environmental provisions to reduce air and water pollution, to preserve wetlands and open space,
and to make transportation facilities more compatible with the environment.

ISTEA SUCCESSES

       The largest ISTEA environmental initiative is the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
       Improvement Program (CMAQ), which authorized $1 billion annually under ISTEA to
       help communities meet national standards for healthy air. CMAQ has funded such
       innovative projects as cleaner natural gas buses in Cleveland and Boise, a child care
       center to promote ridership at a San Jose transit facility, and an inspection and
       maintenance program in Indiana, which ensures that auto emissions systems continue to
       cut pollution.

       ISTEA supported important travel alternatives, such as bikeways and pedestrian paths,
       and preserved scenic and historic roadside vistas, supporting tourism and strengthening
       local economies.

KEY NEXTEA PROVISIONS

      NEXTEA would increase CMAQ funding by 30 percent, to $1.3 billion annually, and
       expand funding eligibility to include scrappage of higher-polluting pre-1980 vehicles. It
       also would act on new research on the dangers of particulate matter by allowing areas that
       do not meet health standards for this pollutant to receive CMAQ funds. NEXTEA also
       would ensure that no state loses CMAQ funds as a result of the Environmental Protection
       Agency's proposed changes in air quality standards.

      NEXTEA would increase Transportation Enhancements funding by more than 25 percent,
       supporting projects designed to strengthen the cultural, aesthetic, and environmental
       aspects of our transportation system.

      The National Scenic Byways program, which designates roads of aesthetic or historic
       value and funds improvements to them, would be continued, and the list of eligible
       activities would be expanded to include scenic byway marketing programs. Funding for
       recreational trails, bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways, landscaping, and
       wildflower plantings also would be continued, as would ISTEA's commitment to
       inclusive transportation planning which reflects such community values as environmental
       preservation.

IMPROVING TRANSPORTATION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY



Technology can improve the performance of roads and transit systems and effectively increase
their capacity, especially in urban areas where new construction is too expensive or
environmentally unsound. Technology also can make travel safe: most automobile crashes
involve human error, and advanced collision avoidance systems and highway-rail grade crossing
warnings can save hundreds of lives annually. Finally, technology can provide the logistical
support needed for such innovations as "just-in-time" deliveries, which are cutting costs and
improving productivity at nearly a third of U.S. companies.

ISTEA SUCCESSES

       ISTEA established a major federal commitment to intelligent transportation systems
       (ITS), the application of advanced information and communications technologies to
       travel. The federal role includes providing seed money for development and
       deployment, assistance in the creation of technology standards to promote system
       integration, and the coordination of public and private research efforts.

       The first generation oflTS is already being deployed: in Denver, synchronized traffic
       signals reduced travel times by over 15 to 20 percent, and in Seattle, ramp metering has
       cut accident rates by more than 60 percent. Operation TimeSaver, an initiative to reduce
       travel times in 75 cities by 15 percent over the next decade, was launched last year.
       Under this initiative, states may use their federal transportation funds to deploy ITS
       systems.

       Overall federal transportation research and technology investment increased to record
       levels, $930 million in 1997 alone. Initiatives resulting from this investment include
       high-performance materials, such as Superpave asphalt, which cost less and last longer,
       and the application of global positioning satellite systems to aviation and maritime
       navigation.

KEY NEXTEA PROVISIONS

      NEXTEA would provide states and localities with ITS training and technical assistance,
       and fund a $600 million incentive program to help cities integrate their ITS programs and
       to help rural areas deploy ITS to improve safety. mobility, and commercial vehicle
       operations. It also would expand the eligibility of all major program categories to
       include ITS, so technology will always be considered as a strategy for meeting travel
       demand.

      NEXTEA would increase overall federal investment in technology research for initiatives
       including advanced composites for stronger, safer roads and bridges and
       second-generation ITS technologies such as collision avoidance systems.

STRENGTHENING URBAN COMMUNITIES



Sound transportation is crucial for sustaining economic prosperity and a high quality of life in
our cities. Targeted infrastructure investment can reduce congestion and improve connections
so businesses can take advantage of the city's proximity to suppliers, support services, markets,
and amenities. Such investment also can generate jobs for city residents, directly through
construction, and indirectly by attracting new businesses.

ISTEA SUCCESSES

       ISTEA strengthened the role of cities in the transportation planning process, giving cities
       greater control over a substantial portion of federal funds and enabling them to choose
       projects which best met urban needs.

       Together with the increased flexibility of many programs, this enabled funding to be
       transferred to such urban needs as transit. Over $3 billion traditionally earmarked for
       highways was used for high-priority transit projects, most in cities, and overall transit
       funding increased under ISTEA, reaching a record $6 billion in 1995 alone.

KEY NEXTEA PROVISIONS

      NEXTEA sustains investment in mass transportation by increasing direct federal transit
       funding to $5 billion, by increasing the flexible Surface Transportation Program, and by
       making Amtrak and intercity rail terminals eligible for funding. Transit programs would
       be streamlined to make it easier for local officials to select the options that make the most
       sense for their communities

      NEXTEA includes a six-year, $600 million program to support flexible, innovative
       transportation alternatives, such as vanpools, to get people to where the jobs are and to
       provide access to training and such support services as child care.

      Technology can provide needed additional urban travel capacity with less disruption to
       established communities and at less cost than new construction. NEXTEA proposes to
       make intelligent transportation systems eligible under all major programs, and to create
       an incentive program to ensure that these technologies are fully integrated.

      NEXTEA would further strengthen the role of central cities in regional planning and
       simplify federal planning requirements.

SERVING RURAL AMERICA



Transportation is as vital to rural areas as it is to cities. Sound transport is vital for shipping raw
materials and agricultural products. Tourism, generated by the four in five Americans who drive
for pleasure in rural areas, sustains many local economies. And many rural residents rely on
transit to reach schools, health care, and other necessary services.

ISTEA SUCCESSES

        ISTEA provided over $1 billion for projects in rural America, such as protecting scenic
        roadside vistas, preserving historic transportation facilities, and beautifying communities
        with bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

        ISTEA benefitted rural areas with provisions like special transit programs for small
        communities, transportation enhancements, scenic byways, and set-asides for off-system
        bridges.

    KEY NEXTEA PROVISIONS

       NEXTEA would strengthen rural communities' involvement in transportation planning
        by requiring coordination with local rural officials when statewide transportation plans
        are developed.

       NEXTEA would increase investment in core programs affecting rural areas, such as the
        National Highway System, Transportation Enhancements, and Rural Transit Assistance,
        and expand funding eligibility to include Amtrak and intercity rail, a key lifeline for rural
        America.

       NEXTEA would raise authorizations for the Federal Lands Highways Program to $525
        million, funding improvements on roads in national parks and forests, Indian reservations,
        and other public lands.
