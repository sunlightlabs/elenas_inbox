MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Rt;port



        1. Welfare -- Permitting States to Purchase Food Stamps for Those Losing Federal
Benefits: As part of the supplemental appropriations bill, Congress has agreed that states that
wish to continue food subsidies to certain individuals losing Federal food stamps because ofthe
welfare reform law can do so by purchasing food stamps from the federal government. This
includes both legal immigrants and unemployed non-disabled childless adults. A few months
ago, Washington State asked the Department of Agriculture ifit had legal authority to sell
coupons to states to provide benefits for legal immigrants. Unfortunately, the Department's
legal analysis indicated that it did not. However, we assisted the state in drafting a legislative
proposal, and it has been agreed to by the conferees, with the option also applying to
non-disabled childless adults subject to the new food stamp work requirement. Maryland and
Massachusetts are among the states planning to take advantage of this new option for legal
immigrants.

Note to Elena: I previously told you states with EBT (Maryland) were out of luck on this
legislation, but I was wrong: any state can take advantage of this.

       2. Teen Pregnancy -- National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy You asked
whether we have any continued involvement with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy, which we helped get started. On May 2nd -- the same day you announced the budget
deal -- the First Lady marked the Campaign's first anniversary in an East Room ceremony
recognizing 12 individuals working to lower teen pregnancy rates. During its first year, the
Campaign has focused on building its organization, engaging the media to promote pregnancy
prevention messages, establishing linkages with state and local groups, and commissioning
research on the problem and promising solutions. Former Gov. Thomas Kean, the Campaign's
chairman, spoke along with the First Lady at the May 2nd event.

{Elena -- I assume the following will be an add-on to your weekly on the NGA letter}:
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

         3. Welfare Maintenance of Effort and the Contingency Fund The governors also
expressed concern about an issue involving maintenance of effort and the welfare contingency
fund. In the welfare law, there are maintenance of effort requirements for both the TANF block
grant and for the contingency fund states can access during recessions. There are two major
differences between the MOE for the contingency fund and for the TANF block grant: states
must maintain more of their historic state spending to access the contingency fund (100% vs. 75
or 80%) and they can count fewer kinds of state spending to meet the contingency fund MOE. It
is the latter difference the governors propose to change. They argue that because states plan
their programs around the definition for the basic T ANF block grant, they may not be eligible for
the contingency fund when they need it. They propose to unify the MOE definitions by adopting
the easier-to-meet TANF definition which allows states to count state spending in programs for
families that are not programmatically connected to the T ANF block grant. We have generally
resisted any attempts to weaken the maintenance of effort requirement and opposed accepting
this change in the welfare technical corrections bill.

        4. Immigration - Impact of Immigration on the U.S.: A study released by the
National Research Council found that immigration benefits the u.s. economy overall-- by as
much as $10 billion annually-- and has little negative effect on the income and job opportunities
of most native-born Americans. Only in areas with high concentrations oflow-skilled, low-paid
immigrants are state and local taxpayers are paying more on average to support the
publicly-funded services that immigrants use. While on an annual basis new immigrant families
receive more in publicly-funded services than they pay in taxes, over the long term, the majority
of new immigrants and their descendants will add more to the government coffers than they will
receive during their lifetimes. In recent decades, however, the wage gap between new immigrants
and native-born workers has grown substantially. The gap is largely attributable to the lower
educational and skill levels of newer immigrants.

       The study was funded by the u.s. Commission on hnmigration Reform. The National
Research Council operates the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of
Engineering.

        5. Education - School Voucher Amendment Passes in the Senate: During the debate
on the budget resolution, the Senate passed an amendment, offered by Sen. Lott, which provides
education vouchers for children who have been the victim of violent crimes. The bill provides
for budget authority for this provision in FY2000, but no outlays in any year. The amendment
passed by a 51-48 vote; no Democrat voted for the amendment, and four Republicans (Chaffee,
Jeffords, Collins and Spector) voted against it. Both Sen. Lott and Sen. Dominici voted for the
amendment.

        The amendment was a surprise to almost everyone, and we are still not sure why it was
drafted with no budget but no outlay authority. The expectation is that it will easily be dropped
in conference. The main point seems to have been to provide an important symbolic victory.
We believe this is the first time a voucher provision has ever passed in the Senate.

        6. Education - New Charter Schools Study: Next Wednesday the Department of
Education is scheduled to release the first year findings of a planned 4-year study of charter
schools and their impact on student achievement. The study includes an annual survey of all
charter schools every year for 4 years. The first year results, are based on studies of schools in
the ten states that had charter schools legislation when the study began. Key findings include:

      Over half of all charter schools are newly created; almost one-third were pre-existing
       public schools; a little over one-tenth were pre-existing private schools.

      In most states, charter schools are at least as economically and racially diverse as the
       overall population in the state's public schools. In several states (e.g., Arizona and
       Colorado) charter schools are less diverse.

      The three most significant obstacles cited by charter school leaders are lack of start up
       funds, lack of planning time, and inadequate facilities. Only 6% said federal regulations
       were a significant barrier to getting underway.

        7. Education - Reauthorization of Idea You requested additional information in
response to a May 16 Wall Street Journal article which suggested that the overhauled IDEA does
not go far enough in enabling school authorities to deal with disruptions caused by students with
disabilities.

        The new bill continues to provide procedural safeguards for students with disabilities, in
order to protect their right a free and appropriate education. Within that framework, it
strengthens the ability of teachers and principals to deal with disruptive or dangerous students,
including those with disabilities. It does this by:

              making it easier for principals to remove children with disabilities who bring a
               gun, weapon or drugs to school, or who pose a danger to themselves, their
               teachers or their classmates from the classroom, while continuing to provide them
               with an education in another setting.
              making it easier to address a child's behavior problems early on -- before they get
               out of hand -- by requiring that these be considered in the development of an
               Individual Education Plan, and by making the regular classroom teacher a part of
               the team that develops the plan.

        These changes were worked out in a bipartisan, bicameral group that also included the
Administration and representatives of the education and disabilities communities. While not
ideal from anyone's point of view, it represents something that all parties could agree to.
Especially since education has such a strong culture of regulation, especially in special education,
 the maintenance of procedural requirements for removing students with disabilities from
school (which have been at the heart of the federal guarantee of access to education) the bill
