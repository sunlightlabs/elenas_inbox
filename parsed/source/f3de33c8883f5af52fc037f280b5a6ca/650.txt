TEXT:



TO:                DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
                   DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
                   DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      JANUARY 28, 1997

SUBJECT:          DAILY LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Today, Congressional Budget Office Director June OD,Neill testified on
CBOD,s Economic and Budget outlook.   (Please call our office at 5-4790 if
you would like a copy of the testimony.)    In her testimony, OD,Neill
claimed that to achieve solvency in ten years, Medicare growth must be cut
by two-thirds, from 9 percent to 3.4 percent growth.    Senator Lautenberg
reportedly criticized CBOD,s pessimistic projections and expressed fear
that cuts to reach a balanced budget would consequentially be too severe.

The Senate Banking Committee reported the nomination of Andrew Cuomo as
the new HUD Secretary by a vote of 18 to O. Also today, the Full Senate
Committee on Appropriations met to discuss subcommittee membership,
committee rules and committee budget issues.

Director Raines will testify on the PresidentD,s Budget on the following
dates, before the following committees:
Friday, 2/7 Senate Budget Committee
Tuesday, 2/11 House Budget Committee
Wednesday, 2/26 Joint Economic Committee


CONGRESS TODAY (1/28)

CONGRESS THIS WEEK:

SENATE:
On Wednesday, beginning at 9:30 am, the Senate will debate the nomination
