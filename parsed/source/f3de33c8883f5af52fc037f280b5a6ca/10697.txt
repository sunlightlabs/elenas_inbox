     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                 GENE SPERLING

     SUBJECT:              EdleyMemo


            Chris's attached memo stresses two areas in economic opportunity and development
     where he feels our efforts so far are inadequate. While we will agree it would be good to do
     even more and while there are legitimate differences on how best to tackle these challenges, it is
     important to put his ideas in both areas in perspective.

     Economic Development:

              On top of Empowerment Zones, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Community
     Development Financial Institution (CDFI) fund, you will announce on Friday the New Markets
     Initiative, which will dramatically expand capital investments in our underserved areas. This
     initiative will include:

           A New Market Investment Tax Credit: You will propose a new $1 billion tax credit,
            which will be available for qualified equity investments made in selected targeted
            investment vehicles. An investor will receive total tax credits up to a fixed percentage of
            his/her investment. This tax credit will leverage $6 billion in additional investment in
            our distressed communities.

           The Creation of America's Private Investment Companies (API C): In response to
            concerns that the SBICs are too limited in size to meet the need for larger-scale
            investment in underserved areas, you will propose a new program to stimulate equity
            investments in larger-scale businesses in, or relocating to, central cities or rural areas.
            This new program will provide government guarantees on debt up to two times the
            amount of equity investment allowing up to five investment firms each with up to $300
            million to invest -- or up to $1.5 billion in investment.

           New Markets Venture Capital Firms (NMVC): To help small-sized firms in
            underserved areas that need investment and technical assistance, you will propose that
            investors get government guarantees on debt matching the level of equity investment,
            provided they also match technical assistance and administer it to the business to support
            the investment. The program should provide long-term, patient growth capital and
            facilitate critically needed technology and management skills development for these firms.


                                                      1
                                                                                     Hex텱ump Conversion


             Chris recommends re-chartering the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBS) to create
     a National Community Investment Bank with the goal of promoting community development.
     While we share Chris's interest in the potential ofGSEs doing more to meet public policy
     objectives, the issues involving Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLBS are complex and
     delicate and the proposals that Chris advances are not as simple as he makes them sound.

            In the end, we believe that the New Markets Initiative has a far greater chance of passing
     Congress, and thus, makes more sense. Therefore, while Chris's proposal may be something we
     should aspire to, you should know that the experts within your Administration have significant
     problems with it.

              For example, it may be impossible for the FHLBS to simultaneously increase its public
     purpose obligations that are tied to access to low-cost funds and use their access to below-market
     capital to make a profit through arbitrage. In particular, there is much skepticism that political
     dynamics will allow us to add new public purpose obligations on the FHLBS -- the off-budget
     subsidies of which Chris writes -- and reduce arbitrage significantly at the same time. More
     likely, some fear, the mission will be expanded and the leakage of federal subsidy to private
     hands will grow. Treasury has thus far insisted that these "abuses" be stemmed before any even
     modest mission expansion can go forward.

            If you would like to pursue this idea further, we can prepare a pro/con memo to inform
     your decision on how to proceed.

     Youth Jobs:

             We share Chris's goal of "breaking the back of endemic hyper-unemployment in
     distressed communities." However, we must respectfully disagree with Chris's belief that your
     Youth Opportunities Initiative is not "the answer" because it is too concentrated in a few areas
     and will serve "only" 50,000 poor children this year.

              The overwhelming weight of the academic research shows that in order to truly help
     out-of-school youth we need to saturate small areas with a lot of resources so that we change the
     culture of joblessness and high unemployment. This is precisely what the Youth Opportunity
     Initiative will do. For the record, it is important to note that sen:ing 50,000 out-of-school youth
     nationwide is not a "drop in the swimming pooL" Last year, there were 280,000 unemployed
     African-American teenagers and one million African Americans (aged 18-24) living in poverty.
     Therefore, we are addressing a significant part of the problem.                         .

             Finally, Chris's memo ignores the tremendous progress you have made in the past couple
     of years to address the problems of politically powerless disadvantaged youth. His memo does
     not address the fact that we got $250 million in last year's budget for Youth Opportunity Areas,
     $120 million for GEAR-UP, and $70 million more to help minorities prepare for college and stay
     in college through the TRIO program. In sum, we will invest $510 million more in FY99 than
     in FY98.

              If you include the expansions of existing programs and the new initiatives in your
       FY2000 budget, our investments in programs specifically targeted at poor children are $902
       million higher than in 1998. (See table) In the face of a partisan Republican Congress, this is
       absolutely remarkable progress and will certainly purchase more than "a wrench and two
       screws."
