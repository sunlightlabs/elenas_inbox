    PRESIDENT SAYS NEW SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT UNDERSCORES THE NEED
            FOR COMPREHENSIVE BIPARTISAN TOBACCO LEGISLATION
                           April 27, 1998 -- 4/24 draft

Today, the President said a new Surgeon General's report on minority tobacco use underscores the
urgent need for comprehensive legislatio'n to reduce youth smoking. The report shows that smoking
has increased dramatically among minority youth, rising 80 percent among African American and 34
percent among Hispanic youth from 1991-1997. Tobacco use is also increasing among Asian
American and American Indian/Alaska Native youth, according to the most recent data available.
This report -- the first to be released by newly appointed Surgeon General David Satcher -- is the first
comprehensive source of data on the use and health impacts of tobacco among minority/ethnic groups.

The Surgeon General's Report Documents Disturbing Trends in Tobacco Use. African
Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans and American Indians/Alaska Natives make up nearly
one-fourth of the United States population and will account for one-half of the population by the year
2050. The report provides a comprehensive analysis on the effect oftobacco on these groups,
including that:

      Teen smoking rates are rising in many ethnic and minority groups, and adult smoking
       rates are strikingly high among certain populations.

               Teen smoking rates rose among African-Americans and Hispanics from 1991-1997.
               Smoking rates among African-American high school students were up by a startling
               80 percent -- more than twice the increase among Hispanics (34 percent) and whites
               (28 percent).

               The most recent data also shows disturbing trends among Asian American and
               American Indian/Alaska Native youth. From 1990 to 1995, cigarette smoking
               increased by 17 percent among Asian American 12th graders and by 26 percent among
               their American Indian and Alaska Native counterparts.

               The report also documents that American Indians have the highest adult smoking rates
               of any U.S. subgroup -- nearly 40 percent, compared to 25 percent of all adults.

      Cigarette smoking is a major cause of death and disease among aU minority and ethnic
       groups. The report documents that:

               Lung cancer is the leading cancer death for all four minority/ethnic groups. The increase
               in youth smoking threatens to reverse recent progress that has been made against lung
               cancer among minority and ethnic groups.

               African-American men bear the greatest health burdens from lung cancer, with death
               rates about 50 percent higher than whites. Lung cancer incidence has increased
               substantially among Alaska Natives (93 percent increase for men and 241 percent
               increase for women) since the 1970s.

               Smoking increases infant mortality and low birth weight, and the rate of sudden infant
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
              death syndrome is high among Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians who smoke.
      The tobacco industry has targeted advertising and promotion campaigns iii ethnic and
       minority communities that pose serious challenges to reducing smoking among this
       population. The report found that:

              Tobacco products are intensively advertised in racial/ethnic communities and economic
              contributions heavily fund minority and ethnic community organizations, businesses,
              and publications. For example, in one city, 62 percent of billboards in predominantly
              African American neighbhorhoods advertised cigarettes, compared with 36 percent of
              billboards citywide.

      More research and prevention are needed to better understand of racial and ethnic
       smoking patterns and reduce tobacco rates among racial and ethnic minorities.

              The Surgeon General's report highlighted existing models of successful
              community-based tobacco prevention and cessation programs as well as successful
              Federal programs that are tailored to the needs of specific minority and ethnic
              communities.

              However, the report clearly states that there is need for research to develop more
              effective culturally-appropriate prevention and cessation programs.

The President Renewed His Call for Comprehensive Bipartisan Tobacco Legislation. The
President emphasized that this report once again demonstrated the need for comprehensive tobacco
legislation to reduce youth smoking, and renewed his call to Congress to send him comprehensive
bipartisan legislation this year which:                                                     .

      Raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years and imposes
       tough penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids;

      Confirms the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products;

      Gets tobacco companies out of the business of marketing to children;

      Furthers public health research and goals;

      Protects tobacco farmers and their communities.

The President noted that Senator McCain's legislation is a strong step in that direction and that
Congress should not delay, given that every day 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1,000 of
them will will die prematurely as a result.

L      PURPOSE

       To release the Surgeon General's report on tobacco use among minorities which
       underscores the urgent need for comprehensive legislation to reduce youth smoking.

II.    BACKGROUND

The Surgeon General's report shows that smoking has increased dramatically among minority
youth, rising 80 percent among African American and 34 percent among Hispanic youth from
1991-1997. Tobacco use is also increasing among Asian American and American Indian/Alaska
Native youth, according to the most recent data available. This report -- the first to be released
General Satcher -- is the first comprehensive source of data on the use and health impacts of
tobacco among minority/ethnic groups.

The Surgeon General's Report Documents Disturbing Trends in Tobacco Use. African
Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans and American Indians/Alaska Natives make up nearly
one-fourth of the United States population and will account for one-half of the population by the
year 2050. The report provides a comprehensive analysis on the effect of tobacco on these
groups, including that:

      Teen smoking rates are rising in many ethnic and minority groups, and adult
       smoking rates are strikingly high among certain populations.

              Teen smoking rates rose among African-Americans imd Hispanics from
              1991-1997. Smoking rates among African-American high school students were
              up by a startling
              80 percent -- more than twice the increase among Hispanics (34 percent) and
              whites
              (28 percent).
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


          The most recent data also shows disturbing trends among Asian American and
          American Indian/Alaska Native youth. From 1990 to 1995, cigarette smoking
          increased by 17 percent among Asian American 12th graders and by 26 percent
          among their American Indian and Alaska Native counterparts.

          The report also documents that American Indians have the highest adult smoking
          rates of any U.S. subgroup -- nearly 40 percent, compared to 25 percent of all
          adults.

   Cigarette smoking is a major cause of death and disease among aU minority and
    ethnic groups. The report documents that:

          Lung cancer is the leading cancer death for all four minority/ethnic groups. The
          increase in youth smoking threatens to reverse recent progress that has been made
          against lung cancer among minority and ethnic groups.

          African-American men bear the greatest health burdens from lung cancer, with
          death rates about 50 percent higher than whites. Lung cancer incidence has
          increased substantially among Alaska Natives (93 percent increase for men and
          241 percent increase for women) since the 1970s.

          Smoking increases infant mortality and low birth weight, and the rate of sudden
          infant death syndrome is high among Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians
          who smoke.

   The tobacco industry. has targeted advertising and promotion campaigns in ethnic
    and minority communities that pose serious challenges to reducing smoking among
    this population. The report found that:

          Tobacco products are intensively advertised in racial/ethnic communities and
          economic contributions heavily fund minority and ethnic community
          organizations, businesses, and publications. For example, in one city, 62 percent
          of billboards in predominantly African American neighbhorhoods advertised
          cigarettes, compared with 36 percent of billboards citywide.

   More research and prevention are needed to better understand of racial and ethnic
    smoking patterns and reduce tobacco rates among racial and ethnic minorities.

          The Surgeon General's report highlighted existing models of successful
          community-based tobacco prevention and cessation programs as well as
          successful Federal programs that are tailored to the needs of specific minority and

                   Surgeon General Report on Minority Tobacco Use
                             April 27, 1998 -- 4/24 Draft


Q.   What did the Surgeon General's Report say?

A.   The Surgeon General's Report being released today is the first comprehensive report on
     minorities and tobacco use. Specifically, the report finds that from 1991 to 1997,
     smoking increased by 80 percent for African-American youths and by 34 percent for
     Hispanic youth. The report finds that cigarette smoking is a major cause of disease and
     death among minority populations, and says that this problem will only get worse if
     tobacco use is not reduced among these populations. The report also documents that
     efforts to reduce and prevent smoking among minority and ethnic populations are clearly
     undermined by the tobacco industry's heavily targeted advertising and promotion of
     tobacco products within minority and ethnic communities.

     This report clearly demonstrates, once again, why Congress needs to pass comprehensive
     tobacco legislation designed to reduce youth smoking this year.

Q.   Does the President have a specific proposal to address the particular problem of
     tobacco use within minority communities?

A.   Passing comprehensive tobacco legislation designed to reduce youth smoking will help
     all Americans -- regardless of their background or ethnicity. The Surgeon General's
     report clearly illustrates that this is an extremely important issue in minority and ethnic
     communities. It also demonstrates that we need to better understand tobacco use among
     and the impact on minority and ethnic groups. For example, we clearly want to look
     carefully at why smoking rates increased by 80 percent for African-American youth and
     by 34 percent among Hispanics from 1991 to 1997 and better understand how prevention
     and cessation efforts can target these problems more effectively. We will continue to
     work closely with the minority health community to determine how best to address these
     issues.

Q.   Aren't the minority health organizations and the Congressional Minority Caucuses
     drafting legislation to address the specific problems of tobacco use among and.
     impact on minorities? What is your reaction to these proposals?

A.   The principles that the President has outlined for comprehensive tobacco legislation
     would certainly address many of these problems. The President shares the concerns of
     the minority community, and the Surgeon General's report clearly underscores that we
     need to better understand tobacco use among and impact on minorities. We look
     forward to reviewing closely any proposals that address our shared concerns.

     programs designed to address minorities and tobacco use?

A.   We think that all children should be targeted in the most effective ways to prevent or stop
     them from smoking, The Surgeon General's report recognizes that minority
     communities have been targeted by the tobacco industry and underscores the need to
     better understand tobacco use among and the impact on minority/ethnic populations.
     Certainly varied approaches that reflect some of the differences in these populations are
     necessary to achieve this success.

Q:   Aren't the fees imposed by the Administration's plan and the McCain bill regressive
     and therefore hit minority communities hardest?

A:   The tobacco industry has spent billions of dollars marketing to low-income and
     minorities, and made billions of dollars at their expense. Big Tobacco doesn't care about
     poor people -- it just wants to keep hooking future smokers. As a result, low-income
     people have suffered a disproportionate level oftobacco-related harm. The
     Administration is committed to making sure cessation programs are available to help
     smokers quit -- and just as important, that we change the way the tobacco industry does
     business so it no longer preys on poor kids in the first place.

Q:   Are you concerned about the information reported in last week's New York Times
     that young African Americans are smoking more to enhance the high from
     marijuana?

A:   This Administration has long recognized that cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs all pose
     a serious threat to our youth. Studies have shown that kids who make it to their 21st
     birthday without having smoked a cigarette, taken a drink or turned to drugs are almost
     certain to avoid chemical dependency throughout their lives. That is why our goal must
     be to keep teenagers from having that first drink, trying a cigarette, or experimenting with
     illegal drugs before they are old enough to know better and to realize the consequences of
     their decisions.

     Weare greatly concerned by new data released earlier this month showing that smoking
     among African American youth has increased by 80 percent over the last six years. New
     information relating this trend to marijuana use is very disturbing, and provides still
     further reason to take strong action against illegal drugs. Of course, as the New York
     Times points out, the increase in tobacco use is even more heavily associated with
     advertising and other media messages that have a great impact on young people. That's
     why minority youth tend to smoke Kool and Newport, brands advertised with minority
     images, while white youth smoke Marlboro and Camel, whose ads feature white
     characters.

     These facts underscore why we need comprehensive legislation to reduce youth smoking
     by raising the price of cigarettes, putting into place tough restrictions on advertising and
     access, imposing penalties on the industry if it continues to sell cigarettes to children, and

     ensuring that the FDA has authority to regulate tobacco products.

Q.   What do you think of the House Republican proposal to link drugs and tobacco in
     a single bill?

A.   Nobody disagrees about the need to be tough on drug use, but that is no excuse to be less
     than tough on youth smoking. We need to pass strong, comprehensive tobacco
     legislation this year that dramatically reduces youth smoking by raising the pack of
     cigarettes, imposing tough penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids, granting
     the FDA authority over tobacco products, and restricting advertising and marketing to
     children. The McCain bill, which passed the Senate Commerce Committee by a 19-1
     vote three weeks ago, is a strong step in that direction. If Republicans want to add good
     anti-drug provisions to a comprehensive tobacco bill of this kind, we have no objections.
     But the bill must address the problem of youth smoking comprehensively; anti-drug
     provisions can't serve as an excuse for watered-down tobacco legislation.

Q:   What exactly is the President's strategy on drugs?

A.   This past February President Clinton released the 1998 National Drug Control
     Strategy, a comprehensive ten-year plan to reduce drug use and availability by
     50% -- to a historic new low. The strategy is backed by a $17 billion anti-drug
     budget in FY 1999 -- the largest ever presented to Congress, with a $1.1 billion
     increase over last year's budget.

     While the strategy incorporates specific goals and objectives in the areas of drug
     treatment and prevention, domestic law enforcement, interdiction, and international
     programs, its number one goal is to educate and enable our youth to reject illegal
     drugs. That is why the largest budget increases (15% over last year's funding
     levels) are targeted for this purpose. In contrast, Speaker Gingrich and the House
     RepUblicans tried to cut the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program -- the program
     that funds anti-drug efforts in 97% of the nation's school districts -- by a full 50%
     just a few years ago.

     Key initiatives in the drug strategy include:

     Protecting Kids:
            $195 Million National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign to make sure that
            when kids turn on the television or surf the "net," they learn about the
            dangers of drugs.
            $50 Million for School Drug Prevention Coordinators to improve and expand
            the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program by hiring more than 1,000 new
            prevention professionals to work with thousands of schools in preventing
            drug use.

     Strengthening Our Borders:
           $163 Million for Border Patrol to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol officers and
           for "force multiplying" technology.

            $54 Million for Advanced Technology for the Customs Service to deploy
            advanced technologies, such as X-ray systems and remote video surveillance.
            $75.4 Million to Support Interdiction Efforts in the Andean region and
            Caribbean, and to train Mexican counterdrug forces.

     Strengthening Law Enforcement:
           $38 Million to Crack Down on Methamphetamine and Heroin by hiring 100
           new DEA agents, expanding the Administration's anti-methamphetamine
           initiative, and targeting heroin traffickers.

     Breaking the Cycle of Drugs and Crime:
           $85 Million to Promote Coerced Abstinence to help state and local
           governments implement drug testing, treatment, and graduated sanctions for
           drug offenders.

     Closing the Treatment Gap:
            $200 Million Increase for Substance Abuse Block Grants to help states close
            the treatment gap.

Q.   What is wrong with passing a "skinny" tobacco bill? Why do you need a
     comprehensive bill?

A.   Every day, 3000 children and adolescents begin smoking, and 1,000 will die prematurely
     as a result. Experts agree that in order to dramatically reduce youth smoking we need to
     take a comprehensive approach that will attack the problem from a variety of angles.

           Price: All experts agree that the single most important step we can take to reduce
            youth smoking is to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes significantly. That is
            why the President has proposed raising the price of cigarettes by $1.10 over five
            years -- an increase that both the Treasury Department and the Congressional
            Budget Office agree should cut youth smoking by about a third.

           Advertising: Studies show that industry advertising significantly contributes to
            youth smoking rates. The Treasury Department has estimated that the advertising
            and marketing restrictions in the McCain bill should cut youth smoking by about
            15 percent. This is a conservative estimate: an American Medical Association
            study recently found that a full 34% of teen smoking is attributable to promotional
            acti viti es.

           FDA Jurisdiction: Reaffinning the FDA authority over tobacco products is
            necessary to help stop young people from smoking before they start. Currently,
            nearly 90 percent of people begin smoking before age 18, despite the laws that
            make it illegal to sell cigarettes to minors. FDA Authority will ensure that young
            people do not have access to these products.

           Penalties: Strong lookback penalties will act as an insurance policy to ensure that
            the tobacco industry takes meaningful steps to reduce youth smoking. If the bill's

                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
            provisions on price, advertising, and FDA jurisdiction do not bring youth smoking
            down as much as expected, penalties will kick in to ensure that the industry has
            every incentive to take further action to reduce youth smoking.

     All of these measures support and reinforce each other; all are necessary to ensure that
     legislation dramatically reduces youth smoking.
Q:   Isn't the President's plan a big government, big tax proposal?

A:   No. What the President's approach does is to attack the problem of youth smoking
     comprehensively, as all experts say we need to do, by combining strong provisions on
     price, penalties, advertising and access, and FDA jurisdiction. Although we have some
     differences with Senator McCain, he also recognizes the need to move forward on all
     these fronts to reduce youth smoking. That's not about big government. It's about
     sensible, bipartisan steps to dramatically reduce youth smoking.

Q.   But won't the McCain bill create 17 new federal bureaucracies?

A.   No -- this isn't about big government. That's just another Big Lie from Big Tobacco.
     What the bill does is to ensure that the federal government has the authority to regulate
     tobacco products in order to reduce youth smoking, as well as the ability to target tobacco
     revenues to strong public health and research efforts. The so-called "bureaucracies" that
     the industry is now complaining about are nothing more than what's necessary to protect
     the public health in this way -- to ensure that cigarettes are not sold to minors, to promote
     effective education, and to encourage smoking cessation. The proof that this is an
     industry con job is clear: almost all these provisions were in the June 1997 proposed
     settlement put forward by 41 state attorneys general, which the industry agreed to. The
     industry is criticizing these provisions now only because the political tide has turned
     against it, and certain other aspects of the legislation have gotten stronger.

Q:   Hasn't the Administration proposed proposed a big government scheme that would
     extend the reach of the federal government to every mom-and-pop grocery store?

A:   No. The Administration has offered proposals designed to reduce smuggling that would
     require wholesalers, distributors, and retailers to identify themselves as such. That's no
     more than what any business has to do now to sell liquor -- and no more than what most
     states already require sellers of tobacco to do. The important thing is to work with
     Congress to devise a scheme that will facilitate the effort to prevent smuggling, while not
     burdening retailers. The Administration will work with Congress, and the retailers
     themselves, on this issue.

Q:   Aren't you just trying to bankrupt the companies?

A:   We don't want to put the tobacco companies out of business. We just want to put them
     out of the business of selling cigarettes to kids. A central feature of comprehensive
     tobacco legislation is to ensure that most of the payments made by the tobacco companies
     are passed on to price, in order to reduce youth smoking. As a result, there will be at
     most a modest impact on the profitability of the tobacco companies. This is also an

industry with significant cash flow and net assets that will allow it to easily absorb this
modest profit decline. The operating earnings ofRJR, Philip Morris, and Loews last
year were $18 billion. Even RJR, the most highly leveraged firm in this industry, had a
$1.5 billion operating profit for its domestic tobacco business, and has over $4 billion in
net assets from its Nabisco stock holdings. The only real risk of bankruptcy comes from
losing a rash of lawsuits in court.
