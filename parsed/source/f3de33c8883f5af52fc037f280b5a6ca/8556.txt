S. 2271 - Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998
   (Sen. Hatch (R) UT)

The Administration strongly opposes S. 2271 because it would shift
authority over local land use issues away from local communities and State
courts to Federal courts.  The bill would subject local communities to the
threat of premature, expensive Federal court litigation that would favor
wealthy developers over neighboring property owners and the community at
large.  The President will veto S. 2271 or any similar legislation.

S. 2271 would harm neighboring property owners, weaken local public health
and environmental protections, and diminish the quality of life by
undermining local land use planning. Through radical changes to the
existing legal doctrine of ripeness, the bill would give developers
inappropriate leverage in their dealings with local officials by making it
easier to sue local communities far earlier in the land use planning
process.  S. 2271 also purports to allow takings claimants to circumvent
State courts altogether.

The bill would violate constitutional limits on congressional power if
read, as its supporters intend, to allow for a ruling that an
uncompensated taking has occurred even where the claimant fails to pursue
available State compensation remedies.   The bill also would prohibit
Federal courts from "abstaining" or deferring to State courts on certain
delicate issues of State law.   It would lead to poorly informed decisions
by allowing claimants to bring claims in Federal cOurts without an
adequate factual record, the very claims that the courts themselves have
said are unripe for resolution.

S. 2271 would empower the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to invalidate
Federal statutes and rules and grant other injunctive relief in a broad
category of cases.  This unprecedented grant of authority to a non-Article
III court raises a host of serious constitutional and policy concerns.

The bill provides that, by including a property rights claim, any litigant
against the United States could ensure that the entire case would be
reviewed on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
an approach that would promote inappropriate forum-shopping.  This would
dramatically increase the legal influence of the Federal Circuit at the
expense of other circuits, thereby disrupting settled interpretations of
important areas of the law.

S. 2271 also could override the "preclusive review" provisions found in
many Federal statutes, including major environmental laws.  These
provisions allow for the swift and orderly resolution of challenges to
Federal actions.  S. 2271 would deprive affected businesses and the public
of the regulatory stability needed to plan their actions.

 (Do Not Distribute Outside the Executive Office of the President)

This Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) was developed by the
Legislative Reference Division (Briatico), in consultation with NRD
(Fairweather/Dennis), BASD (Orlando), OIRA (Rostker),  the Departments of
Justice (Taylor/Dowling), Transportation (Holstrup) and the Interior
(Lyder),  Environmental Protection Agency (Reeder) , and the Council on
Environmental Quality (Campbell)

S. 2271, was introduced by Senator Hatch on July 7, 1998. The bill is the
ManagerO,s amendment to H.R. 1534, a bill that the Vice President has
stated that the President will veto.  S. 2271 does not make any
substantial changes to H.R. 1534 or address any of the AdministrationO,s
major concerns.

H.R. 1534, with an amendment,     passed the House on October 22, 1997, by a
vote of 248-178.

H.R. 1534 was ordered reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee with an
amendment in the nature of a substitute on February 26, 1998.   As ordered
reported, H.R. 1534 has been amended to include provisions of H.R. 992,
the Tucker Act Shuffle Relief Act of 1997, which was the subject of a
mUlti-agency veto recommendation. H.R. 992 passed the House on March 12,
1998, by a vote of 230-180.

Administration position To Date

On August 15, 1997, the Department of Justice sent a report on H.R. 1534
to Senator Leahy strongly opposing the bill.

On September 25, 1997, the DepartmentO,s Acting Attorney General testified
before the House Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property.  The
testimony indicated that the Attorney General would recommend that the
President veto H.R. 1534 if it passed in its current form.  On October 7,
1997, the Department sent a letter to the Chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee reiterating that Justice would recommend a veto of the bill.

On October 21, 1997, the Statement of Administration Policy sent to the
House Rules Committee indicated that the Attorney General, the Secretary
of the Interior, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,
and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality would recommend that
the President veto H.R.1534, as reported by the House Judiciary Committee.

On March 9, 1998, in remarks before the State Municipal Leagues, the Vice
President stated that the President "will veto ... H.R. 1534 -- or any
similar measures that would undermine local control or waste taxpayer
money" .

Background

Traditionally, the resolution of local land uses has been left to the
neighborhoods and communities that would be most directly affected.
Potential takings claims that result from local zoning laws are frequently
the result of discussion and negotiations to balance competing values.
This process by its very nature may be time consuming.  If no agreement
can be reached, the claimant then proceeds to State courts because real
property issues are within the province of State law.

Federal courts show deference to local decision-making in two important
ways.  First, where appropriate, they abstain from deciding delicate or
,,'

      complex issues of State law so State courts can decide those issues.
      Second, Federal courts require developers and other property owners to
      make every effort to resolve land use disputes with local officials before
      proceeding to a Federal court. Thus, claimants must pursue all available
      avenues of local decision making and the local governmentD,s decision must
      be final before a claim is "ripe" for Federal court review.

      Under current law, takings claimants may have to file in two different
      courts, depending on the relief they are seeking.  In general, the U.S.
      District Court has jurisdiction over cases where litigants are seeking
      injunctive relief or monetary relief for less than $10,000 while the Court
      of Claims has jurisdiction over cases where litigants are seeking only
      monetary relief.
      Confusion over which court to file in can lead plaintiffs to file in the
      wrong court and have to refile in the appropriate court. This "switching"
      is referred to as the "Tucker Act shuffle".

      Provisions of S. 2271

      S. 2271 would:

                      Relax the "ripeness" standard for adjudication by the
      Federal courts to include any claim or action upon which a final decision,
      as redefined for the purposes of the Act, has been rendered.

                       For the purposes of this Act, redefine "final decision"
      to:  (1) ignore State exhaustion of remedy provisions; and (2) use any
      definitive decision made by any party under any statute, ordinance,
      regulation, custom, or usage regarding the extent of permissable uses of
      certain property.

                      Encourage premature lawsuits against local officials by
      allowing claimants to:  (1) sue in a Federal court upon the single
      rejection of a land use proposal; and (2) bypass local procedures for
      variance and waiver applications by only having to submit an application.

                       Prohibit Federal courts from abstaining from exercising
      Federal jurisdiction even in cases where the claimant asserts a violation
      of a State law, right, or privilege or a case is pending in State court.
                      Authorize the District Court, in such cases that cannot
      be decided without resolution of significant but unsettled question of
      State law, to certify such question to the highest appellate court of that
      State.

                      Provide property owners the option of filing a civil
      action to challenge the validity of any Federal action that adversely
      affects the ownerD,s interest in private property in either the District
      Court or Claims Court.

                      Grant both U.S. District Courts and the Court of Federal
      Claims the power to determine all claims -- whether for monetary or
      injunctive relief -- including related tort claims, arising out of Federal
      actions alleged to constitute Fifth Amendment takings.

                      Require the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
      circuit to hear all appeals commenced by authority of this Act.

                      Repeal section 1500 of section 28 of the U.S. Code which
      states that the Court of Federal Claims does not have jurisdiction of any
      related claim to which the plaintiff has pending in another court against
·,

     the United States.

                     waive the sovereign immunity of the United States.

                     Provide for attorneys fees to prevailing plaintiffs.

                     Create a six year statute of limitations.

                    Require a 60 day notice of intent to sue.

                     Require notice to the property owner by the Federal
     government of any agency action that limits the use of private property,
     including personal and real property.

     Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

     According to NRD (Dennis) and BASD (Orlando), S. 2271 would not affect
     direct spending or receipts, therefore, it is not subject to the
     pay-as-you go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
     Act of 1990.
