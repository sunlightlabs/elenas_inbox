TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: APRIL 17, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Today, the House swore in its newest member, Democrat Representative Ciro
Rodrigues of TexasD, 28th District.   Congressman Rodrigues fills the seat of
the late Representative Frank Tejeda.

Subcommittees on Health & Environment and Oversight & Investigation regarding
the EPAD,s rules concerning particulate matter and ozone.

Deputy Director John Koskinen will testify on Friday, April 18, before the
House Government Reform Committee regarding debt collection.



 CONGRESS TODAY (4/17):

 SENATE
 The Senate passed (53-44) S. 495, as amended, a bill to establish domestic laws
 and enforcement tools to prosecute activities involving chemical weapons.    The
 bill would also require that the President sanction countries that engage in
 chemical weapons activities, and would provide the death penalty for violations
 of the law that lead to the loss of life.
   [SAP on the Chemical Weapons Convention sent, 4/17: D&For the   reasons
 expressed by the President in the attached statement, the Administration
 strongly urges the Senate to expeditiously grant its advice and consent to
 the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention;     SAP on S. 495 sent,
 4/17:   Strongly oppose]

 HOUSE
 By a vote of 227-190, 3 present, the House agreed to Rep. SolomonD,s motion to
 strike from the record Representative John LewisD, remarks regarding Speaker
 Gingrich paying his $300,000 ethics violations fines.  The House then tabled a
 motion to object by a vote of 223 -199.

 The House considered H.R. 400, the 21st Century Patent Improvement Act, but did
 not come to resolution. While under consideration, the House rejected
  (178-227) the Rorhbacher substitute amendment, which would have changed the
 term of a patent to the longer of either 20 years from the filing of the
 application or 17 years from the grant of the patent. The House hopes to
 complete consideration of the bill on Wednesday, April 23rd.
   [House Rules SAP sent, 4/15 : Administration supports House passage of the
