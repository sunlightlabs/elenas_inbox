Year 2000 Legislation (DISCUSSION DRAFT)   - July 13, 1998


Section 1. Short Title.

This Act may be cited as the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act.

Section 2. Findings.

The Congress hereby finds the following:

(1)     The disclosure of information related to Year 2000 readiness of
entities, products and services is a matter of national importance and a
vital factor in minimizing any potential disruption to the nation's
economic well-being as result of the transition to the new Millennium.

(2)     Concern about the potential for legal liability associated with
the disclosure of Year 2000 compliance information may be impeding the
disclosure of such information.

 (3)    The national interest will be served by uniform application of
the law in connection with the disclosure of Year 2000 readiness
information in order to promote disclosures of such information in a
timely fashion.

(4)     The capability to freely disseminate and exchange information
relating to Year 2000 readiness, including among competitors, is critical
to the ability of public and private entities to address Year 2000 needs
in a timely manner.


Section 3. Definitions.

For purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall apply:

(1)     Year 2000 statement. The term "Year 2000 statement" means any
statement -

(A)     that describes an assessment, projection, or estimate
concerning Year 2000 processing capabilities of any entity, product or


service;

(B)     that describes plans, objectives, or timetables for
implementing or verifying the Year 2000 processing capabilities of an
entity, a product or service or a set of products or services; or

(C)      that describes test plans, test dates, or test results
relating to Year 2000 processing by:

(i)    products, or

(ii)    services that incorporate or utilize products;

(0)     of the type defined in (A), (B), or (C) that may be required by
any federal, state, or local law or regulation, except as otherwise
provided 'herein.

(2)     Statement. The term "statement" means a disclosure or other
conveyance
of information, in any form or medium whatsoever.

(3)     Year 2000 processing. The term "Year 2000 processing" means the
processing (including, without limitation, calculating, comparing,
sequencing, displaying or storing), transmitting or receiving of date or
date/time data from, into, and between the twentieth and twenty-first
centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000 and leap year calculations.

(4)     Year 2000 Internet Website. The term "Year 2000 Internet
Website" means an Internet website or other similar electronically
accessable service, designated as an area where Year 2000 statements and
other information about the Year 2000 processing capabilities of an
entity, a product, service, or a set of products or services, are posted
or otherwise made accessible to the general public.

(5)     Commercially appropriate efforts. The term "commercially
appropriate efforts" means efforts undertaken without gross negligence,
recklessness, or the intent to mislead or deceive.

(6)        Covered action.   The term "covered action" means:

(A)        a private civil action arising under federal or state law; and

(B) any civil action arising under federal or state law in which a
federal, state or other public entity, agency or authority is acting in a
commercial context rather than in an enforcement capacity.


Section 4. Safe Harbor for Year 2000 Statements.

(1)     General. - Except as otherwise provided in Section 4(3), in any
covered action, to the extent such action is based on an allegedly false,
inaccurate or misleading Year 2000 statement, the maker of any such
statement shall not be liable with respect thereto unless the claimant
establishes, in addition to all other requisite elements of the applicable
action:

(A)        that the statement was material; and

(B)        that the statement was:


(i)     made with knowledge that the statement was false,     inaccurate or
misleading, or

(ii)    not made with at least commercially appropriate efforts to
determine or verify that the statement was accurate and not false or
misleading, except as otherwise provided below in (iii); or

(iii)    made, in the case where the statement is a re-publication of
or otherwise repeats a false, inaccurate or misleading statement
originally made by another, with knowledge that the statement was false,
inaccurate or misleading, or without a disclosure by the maker that the
republished or repeated statement is based on information supplied by
another.

(2)     Year 2000 Internet Website. - In any covered action in which
the adequacy of notice regarding Year 2000 processing is at issue, the
posting of a notice by the entity purporting to have provided such notice,
on that entity's Year 2000 Internet Website shall be deemed an adequate
mechanism for providing such notice.   Nothing in this Subsection (2)
shall be deemed to:

(A)     alter or amend any federal or state statute or regulation
requiring that such notice be provided using a different mechanism; or

(B)      create a duty to provide notice about Year 2000 processing; or

(C)     preclude or suggest the use of any other medium for notice
about Year 2000
processing, or require the use of an Internet Website; or

(D)     mandate the content or timing of any notices about Year 2000
processing.

(3)     Defamation or Similar Claims. - In any private civil action
arising under any federal or state law of defamation, or any federal or
state law relating to trade disparagement or a similar claim, to the
extent such action is based on an allegedly false Year 2000 statement,
whether oral or published in any medium,  the maker of any such Year 2000
statement shall not be liable with respect to such statement, unless the
claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence, in addition to all
other requisite elements of the applicable action, that·the statement was
made with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless
disregard as to its truth or falsity.

         (4)        Limitation on Effect of Year 2000 Statements. - In any
covered action,     no Year 2000 statement shall be interpreted or construed
as an amendment     to or alteration of a written contract, whether public or
private.     This   subsection 4 shall not apply:

(A)      to the extent the party sought to be charged has otherwise
agreed in writing to so alter or amend the written contract,
(B)     to Year 2000 statements made in conjunction with the formation
of the written contract, or
(C)     where the contract specifically provides for its amendment or
alteration through the making of a Year 2000 statement or a similar
statement.

Existing law shall apply to determine what effect, if any, a Year 2000
statement within the scope of (A), (B), or (C) has on a written contract.


(5)     Special Data Gathering.    In any request by a federal agency or
authority, for information relating to Year 2000 processing (including
without limitation, Year 2000 statements) made pursuant to this Subsection
(5), any information provided in response to such request shall be deemed
exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) , and
may not be used, directly or indirectly, in any action (including, without
limitation, any enforcement proceeding) arising under any federal or state
law.   Nothing in this Subsection (5) shall be interpreted or construed as
requiring any party or entity to provide information pursuant to a request
under this Subsection (5).

Section 5.Exclusions.

(1)       [OPTION 1 - No exclusion for securities laws (although "covered
action" already excludes all enforcement actions by government
authorities, including the SEC); OPTION 2 - Except in the case of a Year
2000 statement which is a republication of or otherwise repeats a Year

or affect in any way, and shall not be construed to alter, amend or affect
in any way, the securities laws as that term is defined in Section
3(a) (47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Section
78c(a) (47).J

        {Alternatives require additional review and discussion.}

(2)     This. Act shall pot abrogate, amend, or otherwise alter, and
shall not be construed to abrogate, amend, or otherwise alter, any right
by written contract, whether public or private, under any federal or state
law.

(3)     This Act shall not be deemed to impose upon the maker or
publisher of any Year 2000 statement any increased obligation, duty or
standard of care than is otherwise applicable under applicable federal or
state law, nor does this Act preclude any party from making or providing
any additional disclaimer or like provisions in connection with any Year
2000 statement.
