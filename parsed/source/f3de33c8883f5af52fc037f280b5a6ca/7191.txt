TEXT:
You already have a hard copy, along with the other issue papers.

This one is very straightforward -- a review of the studies,    in an attempt
to prove that price does reduce youth smoking.

Do you see any problem with letting this one out?

                    Background on Youth Smoking Elasticity Estimates

The Treasury Model

      The Treasury model of youth smoking starts from a participation elasticity of -0.7 at the
       current price level of about $1.95 - which means that a 10% increase in price above its
       current level would reduce the number of teen smokers by 7%.

      But this relationship only holds for very small price changes. For larger and larger
       price increases, the Treasury model predicts somewhat smaller proportional reductions in
       teen smoking. This reflects the fact that the teens most likely to respond to price signals
       are also the first to be discouraged from smoking by a price increase.

      Using this model, a $1.10 increase in the real price of cigarettes is projected to reduce
       youth smoking by 32.4%. Since a $1.10 increase in the real price in 2003 represents a
       54% rise, the associated "average" elasticity is actually _0.6. 1

Previous Academic Studies

      A number of studies have attempted to estimate the responsiveness of youth smoking in
       the U.S. to price changes - the participation elasticity, or the change in the number of
       teen smokers due to price changes. This literature is based on comparisons of youth
       smoking rates in high and low tax states, and on how youth smoking changes within
       states as tax rates change.

      The CBO recently summarized this literature by stating that most ofthe evidence points
       to participation elasticities ranging from -0.50 to -0.75. The Treasury estimate is in the
       range used by the CBO.

      The results from this literature are shown in the Table below. Because differences in
       elasticity estimates may be less intuitive, the table below shows - for each analysis of
       youth smoking - the projected reduction in teen smokers from a $1.10 price increase
       (along with the Treasury estimates). Doing so recognizes the fact that the Treasury
       model allows the elasticity to decline for larger price increases.




        I The semi-logarithmic demand function underlying this analysis is based on a standard
model used to predict overall cigarette demand. Under it, every dime ($0.10) increase in price
reduces demand by the same percent, but since it is doing do from a smaller and smaller base at
each step, the absolute reduction in teen smoking from each 10 cent increment declines slightly.

         It is clear that the Treasury estimate is within the range of professional consensus on this
          question. Indeed, our estimates are more conservative than most of the recent work in
          this area.

         One study which estimates a response appreciably different from the remainder of the
          literature (Wasserman et al.) focuses exclusively on the late 1970s. This was a period
          during which some surveys indicate that youth smoking fell precipitously despite no price
          increase. We believe a more appropriate interpretation of the data during the late 1970's
          was that youth smoking was driven down by the broader dissemination of facts about
          smoking's dangers. In 1975 only half of 12th graders saw a great risk in smoking a pack
          or more of cigarettes a day - the lowest level in the survey - but this number increased
          by nearly 25% between 1975 and 1980. Thus, rather than indicating that price does not
          affect youth smoking, we believe this data shows that other things can influence teens in
          addition to price.

         This same problem has led to a misinterpretation by some of the Evans and Huang paper.
          As Professor William Evans of Maryland pointed out in a recent letter to the Commerce
          Committee, the findings of his paper have been misquoted. As noted in the Table above,
          the estimate that Evans endorses is very close to the Administration estimate. The
          confusion over his findings arises from the fact that his estimates which include data from
          the late 1970s show a smaller youth elasticity than his estimates which focus on the 1980s
          and 1990s. As Prof. Evans has noted, however, the data are less reliable for this earlier
          period; in addition, as noted above, this was an era when non-price factors were driving
          teen smoking down in the face of constant prices.

The Cornell Study

         Some have cited the recent study by DeCicca et al. as refuting the previous literature. In
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

       fact, this study finds higher estimates than the remainder of the literature when similar
       estimation techniques are used on their full sample of 8th-12th graders. 2

      The study does find smaller effects when they choose the particular sample of 12th
       graders who weren't smoking in 8th grade, and model whether they start smoking. But
       there is no obvious explanation for this anomalous result; after all, removing from their
       model a population that is more addicted to cigarettes (individuals smoking from 8th to
       12th grade) should raise, not lower, the elasticity estimate. It is troubling that dropping
       the 5% of their sample that is most addicted reduces their estimate so dramatically.

      One criticism levied by DeCicca et al. against the earlier literature is that it does not
       control for differences across states that might determine youth smoking propensities; low
       tax states may have high smoking because of other regulatory or cultural factors. But
       their approach does not address this problem: their estimates of the effect of taxes on 12th
       graders who didn't smoke in eighth grade are still based on a simple comparison of high
       to low tax states. Other studies do directly address this problem. Chaloupka and
       Grossman (1996) do so by including a variety of state characteristics, including state
       anti-tobacco regulations. Evans and Huang (1997) address the problem even more
       directly by examining only the effect of within-state price changes on youth smoking.
       The fact that these estimates are so similar highlights the robustness of the conclusions,
       and indicates why the previous scientific consensus is not undermined by one set of
       anomalous results.

International Evidence

      There has also been much recent attention paid to the fact that youth smoking remains
       high in other countries with much higher cigarette prices. In particular, Wall Street
       analyst Martin Feldman noted in his testimony of March 19th that youth smoking rose in
       the U.K. between 1988 and 1996, despite a 26% rise in the real price of cigarettes. The
       inference that is often drawn from this type of evidence is that higher prices won't deter
       youth smoking in the U.S.

      But these international comparisons are not informative for the response ofyouth in the
       Us. to price changes. The fact that youth smoking rates remain high in other countries
       reflects other cultural factors that influence youth to smoke, and not a rejection of the
       fundamental relationship between price and demand. And increased smoking among
       youth in the U.K. between 1988 and 1996 may have more to do other factors, such as a
       recession which raised youth unemployment rates by 25% over this periQd, than with
       changes in the price of cigarettes.

      In light of this concern, it is certainly preferable to rely on careful, peer-reviewed analysis


        2The estimate cited in our Table is an average of their elasticities for 8th, 10th, and 12th
graders.

    in the U.S. than on this type of anecdotal international evidence.

   Nevertheless, if one is going to make international comparisons, then the most
    appropriate one would be to Canada, since it is more similar to and faces many of the
    same cultural influences as the U.S. The two economic studies which estimate the
    effects of cigarette prices on Canadian teens are both consistent with the findings in the
    U.S. literature - teens are not only responsive to price changes, but they are more
    responsive than adults. In fact, the Canadian youth elasticity estimates are higher than
    those for the U.S.

   Moreover, the pattern of youth smoking in Canada confirms the sensitivity of youth to
    price changes. In 1981, Canada had a youth smoking rate that was about 50% higher
    than that in the U.S. Over the next decade, Canada raised its cigarette prices by over
    100%, and teen smoking fell by almost half -- despite no substantial change in teen
    smoking rates in the U.S. -- so that by 1991 there were fewer teens smoking in Canada
    than in the U.S. The implied elasticity of -0.42 is very close to the estimate that would
    be computed by the Treasury model (which allows the price responsiveness to fall as the
    magnitude of the price increase grows) for this price rise, which is -0.48.

   Teen smoking then rose again in Canada between 1991 and 1994, as Canada lowered
    dramatically its federal excise taxes. Of course, teen smoking was on the rise in the U.S.
    over this period as well, so that the rise in Canada over this time period is not as easily
    attributable to price impacts. But the fact remains that for the country most comparable
    to the u.s., teen smoking rates fell as prices rose, and rose as prices fell.
