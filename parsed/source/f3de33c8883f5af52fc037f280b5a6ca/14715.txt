Income Tax Check-offs and Add-ons
Several states currently rely on a tax check-off or add-on. This method is considered public funding
because it uses the tax system to solicit small, voluntary contributions that are distributed according to a
legal formula administered and enforced by the state. In no state do more than 2 choose to add-on.
Participation rates increase when a tax check-off system is used.
