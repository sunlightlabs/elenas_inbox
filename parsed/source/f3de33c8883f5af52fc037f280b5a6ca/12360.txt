The Honorable C. W. Bill Young
Chainnan
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chainnan:

       The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's views on H.R. 1141, the
FY 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, as passed by the House and by the
Senate. As the conferees develop a final version of the bill, your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.

        In February, the President requested funds to assist in Central America's recovery from
recent natural disasters, to provide urgently needed funding related to the situation in Jordan, and
to provide vital loans and other assistance to our fanners and ranchers. The Administration
continues to believe that both this supplemental request and the recent request for emergency
funding for military and humanitarian operations in the Kosovo region should be approved as
soon as possible, free of extraneous issues.

        Providing essential assistance to victims of natural disasters and helping our fanners at
home with vital financing clearly fall in the category of needs that are urgent, unanticipated, and
essential -- that is, emergency requirements. Therefore, they clearly deserve to be funded
quickly, fully, and without requiring offsets that could force unacceptable reductions in important
programs. We support the House action of providing defense-related emergency funding in
response to Hurricane Mitch without offsets and believe that consistent treatment should be
applied to non-defense agencies perfonning similar emergency activities. We strongly oppose
the Senate provision that would strike emergency funding authority from the entire bill.

         Regrettably, the Senate has also chosen to include several objectionable legislative riders
that threaten approval of the bill, as detailed below. We strongly urge the conferees to approve a
bill that is free of such provisions.

        Were the bill to be presented to the President with the objectionable offsets and riders
discussed below, the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill. We
urge the conferees not to take actions that could result in gridlock and delay, and that would be
detrimental both to our allies abroad and our citizens at home in their time of need.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
Emergency Relief for Central America

        On February 16th, the President transmitted to the Congress a request for $956 million for
International Assistance Programs, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice to
provide assistance for emergency disaster and reconstruction assistance expenses arising from the
consequences of the recent hurricanes in Central America and the Caribbean and the recent
earthquake in Colombia. The Administration appreciates the full funding provided in the House
and Senate bill for this request, which will provide relief from the effects of Hurricanes Mitch
and Georges and restore hope to this devastated region.

        Hurricane Mitch, the worst natural disaster in the history of the Western hemisphere, left
more than 9,000 dead and drove millions from their homes. Even today, hundred of thousands
of Central Americans still cannot return to their homes. Schools, hospitals, businesses, farms
and roads were destroyed, resulting in serious economic dislocation. Hurricane Mitch caused
more than $8.5 billion in damage, and Hurricane Georges brings the total to more than $10
billion. The President's Central America package is urgent, unanticipated, and essential and
should be funded as an emergency request.

        Funds must be provided swiftly to buy seed and plant crops in the Spring planting
season, thereby providing food and jobs to many communities, and to demonstrate to Central
Americans that they can find jobs and security in their own recovering economies. Much of
the rural road system farmers and small merchants depend on for their livelihoods was destroyed.
  Water and sanitation systems have been disrupted, which can result in disease.      Economic
destruction and dislocation threaten to undermine the region's achievements of the past decade, as
these nations have made tremendous strides toward settling conflicts, strengthening democracy,
promoting human rights, opening economies and alleviating poverty. Emergency assistance for
reconstruction aid will ensure that their transformation continues and that illegal migration is
avoided because Central Americans will have cause to view their own futures in the region with
hope. [Being Updated]

Jordan

        The Administration commends the House and Senate for providing the full $100 million
for Jordan, fully funding the FY 1999 request. These funds will provide financial support to
help promote stability in Jordan and the region during the period of transition subsequent to King
Hussein's death. While the Administration appreciates the full funding of the $100 million FY
request, we are disappointed that the $200 million requested for advance appropriations for FYs
2000 and 2001 has not been provided. In the context of promoting peace in the Middle East, the
Administration will continue to press for these advance appropriations.

Department of Agriculture

        The House bill fully funds the President's request for $152 million for emergency funds
for the Department of Agriculture and the Senate bill provides an additional $161 above the
request. The Administration appreciates the House and Senate's support for the requested
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

emergency farm loans and administrative costs. This loan authority would provide vitally
needed financing for the Nation's farmers in light of the significant increase in demand for
USDA loans, due to projected continuing low commodity and livestock prices.

Offsets

       The President has proposed that essential emergency disaster assistance be funded
consistent with the budget rules that have applied to emergency spending since 1990. The
proposed offsets in the House and Senate versions of the bill would result in unacceptable
reductions in funding in areas of crucial importance to Americans.

        An amendment added to the Senate bill would cut over 43 percent of necessary
emergency funding provided in the FY 1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency
Supplemental Appropriations Bill. This provision would result in unworkable reductions to
vital programs, including the following:

              $827 million from anti-terrorism activities including $616 million from activities
               designed to protect our citizens at our embassies and facilities abroad;

               $561 million from disaster relief, reducing resources that FEMA, SBA, and other
               agencies need to continue their work in response to domestic disasters in Florida,
               Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, North and South Carolina, North and
               South Dakota, West Virginia, Texas, California, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee,
               Pennsylvania, Alaska and most other States;

              $289 million from federal drug control programs to implement the Western
               Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. The Senate bill would limit funding for
               counter drug programs in the key source countries, and would disrupt planned
               capital investments by the Coast Guard, State Department, and the Customs
               Service. Further, the purchase of inspection equipment for the Southwest Border
               would be scaled back. In addition, another $91 million would be cut from the
               Coast Guard, thereby seriously eroding its drug interdiction and other
               capabilities.

             $973 million from the non-defense agency Y2K emergency fund. A reduction of
              this magnitude is extremely unwise. Not only would this reduction eliminate the
              remaining balance in the emergency fund ($505 million), but it would also force
              agencies to stop planned and ongoing procurements for Y2K-related activities,
              and cancel contracts in order to recapture the remaining $468 million (where this
              can be done without penalty). With under 250 days remaining until December
              31, 1999, this reduction would substantially undercut the Federal Government's
              ability to solve the Y2K problem and provide services that the American public
              depends upon. Resources must remain available for agencies to carry out
              aggressive strategies to achieve compliance, and, where necessary, to develop and
              implement contingency plans that will ensure uninterrupted service delivery.
                                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion


              $141 million cut from the $325 million appropriated to the Department of Energy
               (DOE) to purchase Russian uranium and $87 million cut from funds disposing of
               Russian plutonium. On March 24, DOE signed an agreement with the Russian
               Federation obligating the U.S. to purchase uranium from Russia for the entire
               $325 million. If these funds are rescinded, Russia would most likely once again
               suspend deliveries under the HEU agreement, which just resumed last week after
               a five-month hiatus. There would also be severe damage to the credibility of the
               United States' commitments to future international agreements. The cut in
               plutonium funds would undermine ongoing negotiations with Russia on the
               schedule and timing for plutonium disposition. It would also undercut U.S.
               efforts to obtain funding commitments from other nations for the full cost of
               Russian plutonium disposition.

       The Senate bill includes a number of other objectionable rescissions such as:

              $100 million from revised inflation assumptions for domestic, non-defense
               programs, which could result in cuts in inflation-sensitive programs such as WTC
               and other essential programs;

              $60 million from the Global Environmental Facility;

              $10 million from the EPA climate change program that develops the technology
               needed for a fuel efficient, less polluting vehicle; and $1 million from NOAA for
               coastal States for implementation of clean water action plan programs;

              $65 million from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that would
               virtually eliminate the benefits of the $80 million supplemental appropriation
               provided elsewhere in the bill. This rescission would slow the provision of
               immigration benefits and compromise enforcement and detention operations. A
               $25 million reduction in the immigration services account would increase
               processing times for applicants legally entitled to benefits, other than citizenship,
               and likely force the shutdown of INS' automated enforcement systems such as
               IDENT and ENFORCE. A $40 million cut in enforcement account funding is
               equivalent to a 20 percent reduction in land border inspection, investigation and
               intelligence programs for the remaining half of this fiscal year. Finally, a $5
               million rescission in the Office of the Inspe~tor General (OIG) and a
               prohibition on future reprogrammings for the OIG, will result in the furlough or
               a reduction-in-force that could affect more than half of the Inspector General's
               current on-board staff.

        The House bill would rescind $875 million from international affairs accounts, with the
largest portion being a rescission of$648 million in appropriations of callable capital from U.S.
payments to the Asian Development Bank (ASDB), the World Bank and the InterAmerican
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

Development Banle Such rescissions would be extremely ill-advised. Rescinding the callable
capital funding would send a dangerous signal to financial markets and could require the ASDB
and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) to pay a higher premium on their borrowing,
which could lead to the restriction of capital flows necessary to strengthen the global economy
and expand U.S. exports. At a time when some of our emerging export markets in Asia and
other developing economies are beginning to recover, this step would be highly unproductive.

        In addition, this rescission of callable capital would call into question U.S. commitment
to all multilateral development banks. This could have a detrimental effect on capital flows and
economic growth globally, including in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This unintended
consequence would even more broadly delay economic recovery in markets vital to the United
States, thereby hurting our own economy.

       The other rescissions in the international affairs area would undermine a host of
important objectives in many programs. For example, the rescissions would cut support for U.S.
exports, undermining our efforts to penetrate foreign markets and provide jobs for American
workers. At a time when the United States needs to promote its exports, this is a particularly
misguided step. The rescissions would also undercut free market reform and democracy
promotion in the New Independent States and in Eastern Europe, areas where it is manifestly in
America's interests to encourage reform. The rescission of development assistance would set
back efforts in the poorest countries, including possibly in those hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch.

       Other rescissions would undermine our efforts to provide peacekeeping operations in
troubled areas of the world. The rescission of Global Environment Facility funding would be
highly detrimental to the cause of improving global environmental protection. Still other cuts
would reduce our contributions to international organizations, where America's reputation as a
contributor in good standing is already tarnished.

       In addition, we oppose the $150 million cut in the House bill in important
nonproliferation programs to reduce stockpiles of excess weapons grade uranium and plutonium
in Russia. Since the Department of Energy has already signed an agreement with Russia to
purchase uranium for $325 million, the entire cut would have to come from the $200 million
appropriated for plutonium. That would drastically undercut negotiations that are underway to
dispose of 50 tons of weapons grade plutonium in Russia, enough for 15,000 nuclear weapons.

       Taken together, these international affairs rescissions are so great that the supplemental as
a whole would constitute a net reduction in U.S. foreign affairs spending -- a reduction that
would seriously undermine America's capacity to pursue its foreign policy objectives and
promote our economic security.

       Finally, since the House and Senate acted on this legislation, there have been important
developments in Kosovo that require resources. A number ofthe rescissions in the House and
Senate versions of the bill are in accounts that can be used to provide critical assistance in
response to immediate needs in the Balkans.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


Objectionable riders

        The House is to be commended for its decision to keep the bill free of objectionable
riders. Unfortunately, the Senate bill includes a number of strongly objectionable provisions,
including the following:

             A provision that would completely relinquish the Federal taxpayers' share of
              the Medicaid-related claims in the comprehensive State tobacco settlement
              without any commitment whatsoever by the States to use these funds to stop
              youth smoking. Federal taxpayers paid more than half, an average of 57
              percent, of Medicaid smoking-related expenditures. The Administration
              believes that the States should retain these funds but should make a
              commitment that the Federal share of the settlement's proceeds will be spent
              on shared national and State priorities: e.g. to reduce youth smoking, protect
              tobacco farmers, improve public health, and assist children. The
              Administration is prepared to work with the Congress on this issue in
              separate legislation.

             Two provisions in the Senate bill that would reopen the compromise reached in
              the FY 1999 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act in Section 123
              concerning Glacier Bay National Park (AK) to ban commercial fishing in
              wilderness waters, phase-out commercial fishing in certain non-wilderness waters
              within Glacier Bay proper, buyout qualifying Dungeness crabbers who had
              previously crabbed in park waters, and continue to permit commercial fishing in
              the waters outside the Bay (where 80 percent of the fish are caught). One
              provision would increase the previously agreed to buy-out packages for crabbers
              and delay implementation of restricted fishing operations (except for closures of
              wilderness waters) by up to a year due to additional rule making requirements.
              The other provision would delay all of the Section 123 fishing restrictions in both
              non-wilderness and wilderness areas (except for the closure of the wi Iderness
              waters of the Dungeness crab fisheries) indefinitely while an unrelated submerged
              lands title issue is settled between the State of Alaska and the Federal
              Government. The compromise reached last fall and codified in Section 123
              should not be re-opened.

             A provision that would postpone until February 2000 the Department of the
              Interior's issuance of regulations prescribing procedures and standards to permit
              Class III casino gaming on Indian reservations when a State will not negotiate a
              gaming compact with a tribe "in good faith." This provision gives the States de
              facto veto power over the compacting process, without providing the tribes the
              option of offering alternative procedures for negotiating gaming compacts. This
              provision is unnecessary since Florida and Alabama filed suit challenging final
              regulatory procedures, which were published in the Federal Register on April
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

                    12th. This issue should be decided through this litigation.

                   A provision that would extend (for the second time) the current moratorium on
                    publishing a final Interior Department rule revising the method by which crude oil
                    from Federal leases is valued for purposes of calculating Federal royalties. The
                    existing FY 1999 rider imposed an eight-month moratorium (until June 1, 1999)
                    and was the outcome of negotiations with the Congress at the end of the last
                    session. This provision would cost the Treasury about $15 million in FY 1999.

                   A provision that would prevent a recent reorganization of the Interior
                    Department's Office of the Special Trustee for the remainder of FY 1999. The
                    reorganization addresses deficiencies in day톞o톎ay Indian trust management
                    operations. However, if this provision were left in place, it would hamper
                    Interior's efforts to resolve and reform trust fund management and represents
                    unjustified micro-management of the Department's activities.

                   A provision that would extend (for the second time) the current moratorium on a
                    final rule governing surface management and reclamation of hard rock mine sites
                    on Federal lands until about December 1999 (from the current June 1999 time
                    frame). The provision unnecessarily ties finalization of the rule making to
                    completion of a National Academy of Sciences study on the need for this rule
                    making.

     Other Issues

            There are a number of other objectionable funding and legislative provisions in the House
     and Senate versions of the bill. Examples follow:

                   The Administration does not support the Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed
                    Loan Programs provision. This loan guarantee program would be ineffective,
                    costly, and would benefit many firms that don't need Federal assistance. With up
                    to 2,000 loans per year, this program would also prove cumbersome for the
                    Department of Commerce to administer and would complicate its ongoing
                    administration of import laws.

                   The Administration also opposes a provision that would provide additional oil and
                    natural gas royalty relief for marginal and other leases located on Federal
                    on-shore, public lands, by providing a credit level of up to $123 million to be
                    applied to the royalties due to the United States. The Administration has been
                    supportive of oil industry economic needs, already providing relief for marginal
                    producers on Federal lands by permitting suspended operations for up to two years
                    on "stripper oil properties" with no penalty, and agreeing to place 28 million
                    barrels of royalty oil into Strategic Petroleum Reserve - in addition to ongoing
                    stripper well royalty relief. Oil prices are also starting to recover in the
                    marketplace. This provision would be cumbersome to administer, may not be
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

       confined only to small oil and gas producers, and would cost the Treasury about
       $30 million in royalty receipts in FY 1999, the remainder in FY 2000.

      On March 10, 1999, the President transmitted a request for $15 million in
       additional supplemental funding for the Department of the Interior to
       support the requirements of the Cobell v. Babbitt class-action lawsuit
       alleging mismanagement of individual Indian money accounts. These
       additional funds would allow the Department to conduct critical activities,
       including court-ordered document production and statistical sampling
       needed this year in defense of the suit. This request is fully offset from other
       Interior appropriation accounts. The House-passed bill provides this
       additional funding, however, the House rejected the Administration's proposed
       offsets. The Administration strongly supports full funding for these efforts with
       the proposed offsets.

      The Administration objects to a provision in the Senate bill that would
       transfer $100 million from the Department of Agriculture's Wildfire
       Management Operations -- primarily firefighting funding -- to its
       Knutson-Vandenberg Fund (K-V Fund), which funds reforestation and
       timber stand management and improvement on national forest lands. A
       transfer of this magnitude is unnecessary and inappropriate. Transferring
       the funds from the appropriated fire operations account would likely require
       that available Forest Service emergency contingency funds be used to fight
       fires in FY 1999, even if FY 1999 is a normal fire year. Should a significant
       fire season occur and the contingency funds be exhausted, the Forest Service
       would have to transfer. funds back from the K-V Fund.

      The Administration opposes the transfer in the Senate bill of disaster relief funds
       from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to the Federal
       Emergency Management Agency. The Administration would like to work with
       the conferees to respond to their concerns about the implementation of the CDBG
       disaster relief program.        .

      The Administration is disappointed that Congress has not adopted the provision
       regarding the auction of available spectrum within the 746-806 MHz band. The
       Administration believes that the FCC is able to conduct the auction in 2000 and
       collect receipts within 2000. The Administration's proposed language facilitates
       the efficient and competitive deployment of spectrum.

We look forward to working with the Congress to address our mutual concerns.

                                     Sincerely,
