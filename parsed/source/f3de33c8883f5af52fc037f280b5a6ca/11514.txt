     MARCH 3, 1999[J


     Part B of Title I of the bill would amend Part B of TitleI of the ESEA, which a
     uthorizes the Even Start
     program.

     Section121, statement of purpose [ESEA, 1201], Section 121 of the bill would a
     mend the
     Even Start statement of purpose in section 1201 of the ESEA by requiri
     ng that the existing community
     resources on which Even Start programs are built
      be of high quality, and by adding a requirement that
     Even Start programs be ba
     sed on the best available research on language development, reading
     instruction
     , and prevention of reading difficulties.   These amendments would reflect amend
     ments made
     to other provisions of the Even Start statute in 1998 and enactment
     of the Reading Excellence Act (Title
     II, Part C of the ESEA) in that same year.


     Section122, program authorized [ESEA, 1202], Section 122 (1) of the bill would
      amend
     section 1202(a) of the ESEA, which directs the Secretary to reserve 5 pe
     rcent of each year's Even
     Start appropriation for certain populations and areas
        As revised, section 1201 (a) (1) would emphasize
     that programs funded under th
     e Spercent reservation are meant to serve as national models; retain the
     curren
     t requirement to support projects for the children of migratory workers, Indian
      tribes and tribal
     organizations, and the outlying areas; specify that the amou
     nt reserved each year for the outlying areas
     is onehalf of one percent of the
     available funds; and permit the Secretary to fund projects that serve
     additiona
     I populations (such as homeless families, families that include children with s
     evere disabilities,
     and families that include incarcerated mothers of young chi
     ldren). The latter provision would replace
     the current requirement to award a
     grant for a program in a woman's prison when appropriations reach
     a certain lev
     el.


A new section 1202(a) (2) would require applicants under the Spercent reservatio
n, other than
the outlying areas, to demonstrate that one or more partners in t
he proposed project has provided highquality, effective educational services to
 adults or young children; and that the proposed project has
substantial potent
ial to serve as a national model for other projects to help meet the educationa
I needs
of lowincome families.   These criteria will help ensure both that these
 projects succeed at the local
level and that they have an impact beyond their
local communities.

Section 122(2) of the bill would amend section 1202(b) of the ESEA, which autho
rizes the
Secretary to reserve up to 3percent of each year's appropriation for
evaluation and technical
assistance.    Because other provisions of the bill woul
d provide a new authority to fund evaluations
across the entire range of ESEA p
rograms, the specific reference to evaluations would be deleted here,
and the m
aximum setaside for technical assistance (the remaining activity under this pro
vision) would
be one percent.    In addition, section 1202(b) would permit the Se
cretary to provide technical
assistance directly, as well as through grants and
 contracts.Section 122(3) of the bill would amend section 1202(c) of the ESEA,
which directs the
Secretary to spend $10 million each year on competitive grant
s for interagency coordination of
statewide family literacy initiatives, to mak
e these awards permissive rather than mandatory, and to
remove the specific dol
lar amount that must be devoted to these awards each year.     The Secretary
shou
Id have the flexibility to determine the ongoing need for these awards, as well
 as the amount
devoted to them, and whether program funds should be devoted ins
tead to services to children and
families.   [l[Conforming amendment would be mad
e to the Reading Excellence Act, Title IIC,
which contains part of the mandate
to make these awards.]O

Section 122(4) and (5) would make technical and conforming amendments to sectio
n 1202 (d)
and (e).

Section 122(5) (A) would amend the definition of "eligible organization" in sect
ion 1202 (e) (2) to
permit forprofit, as well as nonprofit, organizations to qual
ify as providers of technical assistance under
section 1202 (b).   The current Ii
mitation unnecessarily limits the pool of providers, excluding some who
are hig
hly qualified.

Section 123, State programs   [ESEA, 1203].   Section 123(1) of the bill would red
esignate


subsections (a) and (b) of section 1203 of the ESEA as subsections (b)
 and (c) and insert a new
subsection (a) relating to State plans.    New subsecti
on (a) would require a State that wants an Even
Start grant to submit a State p
lan to the Secretary, including certain key information specified in the bill,
including the State's indicators of program quality, which the 1998 amendments
require each State to
develop.  : '[Add discussion of plan duration after languag
e is agreed to for Title I, Part A)D

Section 123(3) and (4) of the bill would make technical and conforming amendmen
ts to section
1203.

Section 124, uses of funds [ESEA, 1204).   Section 124 of the bill would amend s
ection
1204(a) of the ESEA, relating to the permissible uses of Even Start fund
s, by replacing a reference to
"familycentered education programs" with "family
 literacy services".    "Family literacy services" is the
term used elsewhere in
 the statute and defined in section 1202 (e) (3) .

Section 125, program elements [ESEA, 1205). Section 125 of the bill would rest
ate, in its
entirety, section 1205 of the ESEA, which lists the required elemen
ts of each Even Start program.      This
restatement would provide helpful clarific
ation and greater readability for some of these elements;
reorder the elements
in a more logical sequence; add some new elements; and move certain
requirement
s that now apply to local, applications and State award of subgrants (under sect
ions
1207 (c) (1) and 1208 (a) (1)) to the list of program elements, where they mor
e logically belong.

In particular, career counseling and jobplacement services would be added to th
e examples of
services that can be offered as a way to accommodate participants
 , work schedules and otherresponsibilities under paragraph (3).     Paragraph (4)
would be revised to require that instructional
programs integrate all the eleme
nts of family literacy services and use instructional approaches that,
accordin
g to the best available research, will be most effective.      Paragraph (5) would c
ontain a new
requirement that a majority of a program's instructional staff hav
e obtained, or be actively working
toward, certification or other credentials i
n a field directly related to early childhood education, adult
education, or pa
renting education.      Paragraph (6) (currently (5)) would add a new requirement t
hat
staff training be aimed at helping staff obtain certification in relevant i
nstructional areas, as well as the
necessary skills.      Paragraph (8) (currently
(9)) would add (to language incorporated from current
1207 (c) (1) (E) (ii)) a spec


ific reference to individuals with disabilities as included among those who may

be most in need of services.      Paragraph (9) would clarify and consolidate, into
 a single element, the
various statutory provisions that promote the retention
of families in Even Start programs, including the
requirement of current paragr
aph (7) to operate on a yearround basis, the requirement of current
section 120
8(a) (1) (C) to provide services for at least a 3year age range, and the language
 in current
section 1207 (c) (1) (E) (iii) about encouraging participating families
 to remain in the program for a
sufficient period of time to meet their program
 goals.

This updated statement of program elements reflects experience and research ove
r the past
several years.   It will promote better program planning and higher q
uality programs, with better results
for participating families.

Section 126, eligible participants [ESEA, 1206]. Section 126 of the bill would
 amend
section1206(a) (1) (B) of the ESEA to restore the eligibility of teenage p
arents who are attending
school, but who are above the State's age for compulso
ry school attendance.    As amended in 1994, the
current statute terminates a par
ent's eligibility when he or she is no longer within the State's age range
for
compulsory school attendance, excluding many teen parents and their children wh
o could benefit
from Even Start services.

Section 127, applications [ESEA, 1207]. Section 127(a) of the bill would amend
 section
1207(c) of the ESEA, relating to local Even Start plans, byemphasizin
g the importance of continuous
program improvement; requiring a local program's
 goals to include outcome goals for participating
children and families that ar
e consistent with the State's program indicators; emphasize that the program
mu
st address each of the program elements in the revised section 1205; and requir
e each program to
have a plan for rigorous and objective evaluation. Current s
ubparagraphs (E) and (F) of section
1207 (c) (1) would be deleted because the sub
stance of those provisions would be addressed in the
revised statement of progr
am elements in section 1205.

Section 127(b) of the bill would delete subsection (d) of section 1207, which p
urports to allow
an eligible entity to submit its local Even Start plan as part
 of an SEA's consolidated application under
TitleXIV of the ESEA.  This provisi
on has had no practical effect.


Section128, award of subgrants [ESEA, 1208]. Section 128 (a) (1) of the bill wou
ld amendsection 1208(a) (1) of the ESEA, relating to a State's criteria for sele
cting local programs for Even Start
subgrants, by deleting subparagraph (C) , whi
ch refers to a threeyear age range for providing services,
because that provisi
on would be converted to a program element under section 1205.   Section
128 (a) (
1) would also make technical and clarifying amendments to section 1208(a) (1).

Section 128(a) (2) would amend section 1208(a) (3) to require a State's review pa
nel to include
an individual with expertise in family literacy programs, to enh
ance the quality of the panel's review and
selections.  Inclusion of one or mor
e of the types of individuals described in section 1208 (a) (3) (A)
(E) would b
e made optional, rather than mandatory.

Section 128(b) of the bill would add a new authority, as section 1208(c), for e
ach State to
continue Even Start funding, for up to four years beyond the statu
tory 8year limit, for not more than
two projects in the State that have been hi
ghly successful and that show substantial potential to serve as
models for othe
r projects throughout the Nation and as mentor sites for other family literacy
projects in
the State.   This would allow States and localities to learn valuabl
e lessons from welltested, proven
programs.

Section 129, evaluation [ESEA, 1209]. Section 129 of the bill would delete par
agraph (3)
from the national evaluation provisions in section 1209 of the ESEA.
  That paragraph describes certain
technical assistance activities that are mor
e appropriately addressed under section 1202(b).

Section130, program indicators [ESEA, 1210]. Section 130 of the bill would arne
nd section
1210 of the ESEA to set a deadline of September30, 2000 for States t
o develop the indicators of
program quality required by the 1998 amendments.  T
hose amendments did not include any deadline
for the development of those indic
ators.  In addition, the bill would add, to the current indicators that
States
are to develop, indicators relating to the levels of intensity of services and
the duration of
participating children and adults needed to reach the outcomes
the State specifies for the currently
required indicators.

Section 131, repeal and redesignation    [ESEA, 1211 and 1212].   Section 131(a) of
 the bill
would repeal section 1211 of the ESEA,   relating to research.    The ess
ential elements of this section
would be incorporated into the revised   section
on evaluations (1209).  Section 131(b)   of the bill


would redesignate section 12
12 of the ESEA as section 1211.
