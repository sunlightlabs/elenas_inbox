TODAY'S DATA SHOW CONTINUED JOB GROWTH WITH HISTORICALLY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

 Unemployment is at 4.9 percent, as low as its been in 24 years.
         The September unemployment rate was 4.9 -- its 37th consecutive month below 6 and as low as it's
          been since 1973. The unemployment rate has been at or below 5 for six months now with no signs of
          inflationary pressures. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5 . [Source: BLS.]
         The combined rate of unemployment and inflation has been lower under President Clinton than any other
          Administration since Lyndon Johnson was President. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]

 13.2 Million New jobs.
         During the Clinton Administration, the economy has added 13.2 million new jobs -- a faster annual rate of
          job growth (2.5 percent per year) than any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s. [Source:
          Based on data from the Bureau of Lahor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]
         The economy has added 2.7 million jobs over the past year.

 Strong Private-Sector job Growth.
        Since President Clinton took office, the private sector of the economy has added over 12 million new jobs
         -- with 2.5 million jobs added in the past year -- much more than during the entire four-year period before
         President Clinton took office. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]
        93 percent of the 13.2 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector -. that's a
         higher percentage than any Administration since Truman. [sou;ce: Based on data from BLS.]

 Turning The Comer In Basic American Industries.
       Mter losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous four years, 1.1 million new construction jobs
        have been added since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S
        Truman was President. [Source: Bureau of Lahar Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]
       Mter losing 35,000 jobs in the auto industry during the Bush years, we have 129,000 new auto jobs since
        President Clinton took office. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.] .

EARLIER THIS WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT THE INCOME OF THE TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY HAS
INCREASED NEARLY $2,200 SINCE 1993, ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION SINCE PRESIDENT CLINTON
TOOK OFFICE, THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY HAS GROWN 3.6 PERCENT PER YEAR AND
BUSINESS INVESTMENT HAS GROWN BY 11 PERCENT PER YEAR -- THE FASTEST FOR ANY
ADMINISTRATION SINCE KENNEDY WAS PRESIDENT.       THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE
ROBUST GROWTH, STRONG INVESTMENT, AND LOW INFLATION

EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG:
   Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 7/22/97: "The recent perfonnance of the economy,
    characterized by strong growth and low inflation, has been exceptional--and better than most anticipated."
   David Berson, chief economist, Fannie Mae, 6/14/97: "What we have now is the best combination of
    sustained growth and low inflation that we have had in at least a decade."
   Fortune, 6/9/97: "Business is booming, inflation is falling, jobs are plentiful, and American industry is way out
    in front. The U.S. economy is stronger than it's ever been before."
   Business Week, 5/19/97: "Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion
    over five years, sparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and
I systems that brought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity."
