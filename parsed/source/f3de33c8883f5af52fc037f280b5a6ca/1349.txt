TODAY, THE PRESIDENT WILL SEND TO CONGRESS LEGISLATION TO HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES
AND STATES REBUILD THE NATION'S SCHOOLS. As America moves into the 21st century, our schools should
too. The President's new legislation -- the Partnership to RebuHd America's Schools Act -- meets his commitment to
provide $5 billion over four years, leveraging $20 billion, to help local communities and states rebuild America's schools
 -- through both upgrading and new construction to respond to population increases and shifts. The need for this is clear:

      Record Numbers of School Buildings in Disrepair. One-third of all schools-serving 14 million
       students-need extensive repair or replacement. About 60 percent of schools have at least one major building
       feature, such as leaky roofs and crumbling walls, in disrepair. [Source: General Accounting Office Report: "School Facilities: America's
       Schools Report Differing Conditions," June 14, 1996]

      Student Population at an All-Time High. Many school districts also face the need to build new schools to
       accommodate enrollment growth. Public school enrollment in grades K-12 is expected to rise 20 percent
       between 1990 and 2004. [Source: u.s. Department of Commerce, Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1995, p. 151]

      A State and Local Responsibility, and a National Concern. The federal government can, and should, playa
       crucial role in addressing this increasing problem of school disrepair by providing limited resources in a manner
       that spurs states, communities, and even the private sector to provide adequate school facilities for all children.

USING A NEW FORMULA, THE ACT ALLOCATES ONE-HALF OF THE FUNDS TO STATES FOR
STATE BONDS OR FOR DISTRIBUTION TO LOCAL DISTRICTS. Of the $5 billion total for this
initiative, $2.45 billion would be allocated to states using a formula based on the existing "Title I" (education for the
disadvantaged) basic grants formula.

      Leveraging requirement. To receive funds, States will have to assure that the they will increase, over a
       four-year period, the amount of school construction paid for by State, local and private funds.

      States would determine their highest priorities for construction assistance based on a survey of school
       construction needs, awarding the subsidies to those communities with the greatest construction needs and
       least ability to meet those needs with their own resources.

THE ACT TARGETS FUNDS TO THE 100 SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBERS
OF CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY. According to General Accounting Office data, those school districts --
primarily urban -- that have the greatest numbers of children living in poverty have far and away the greatest school
construction needs. This legislation addresses this by providing direct allocations, and a competitive bonus pool, to
those districts facing dire construction needs.

      Leveraging requirement. To receive funds, eligible school districts would have to demonstrate in their
       applications how they will increase, over a four-year period, the amount of school construction paid for with
       State, local, and private funds.

      Districts would determine highest priority needs based on a survey of local construction needs.

      Districts would compete to receive bonus funds. Seventy percent of the funds available directly to local
       districts would be awarded by a formula, based on their Title I shares. The remaining 30 percent would be
       awarded on a competitive basis to those districts with particularly high needs that are willing to provide the
       most support, through non-federal resources, for infrastructure improvement.

PURPOSES OF SUBSIDIZED PROJECTS. Funds for subsidies would be provided to states and local districts
to lower the costs of additional construction or renovation of projects with one of the following purposes:

      Fixing or upgrading classrooms or structures related to academic learning.
      Addressing basic health and safety problems with air quality, plumbing, heating, and lighting.
      Enhancing access for students, teachers, and other people with disabilities.
      Improving energy efficiency.
      Providing infrastructure that facilitates use of educational technology, such as communications closets,
       electrical systems, and power outlets.
      Constructing new schools to meet needs imposed by increased or shifting enrollments.
      Creating after-school learning centers, community schools, and charter schools.

ONE-TIME FEDERAL STIMULUS OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. The funds available
thorough this legislation would be distributed as single awards to States and districts.

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAINTAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCHOOL
CONSTRUCTION. States and localities would continue to maintain full responsibility for determining school
construction needs and administering facilities programs.
                             The Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act of 1997
                                                                            Automated Records Management System

The Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools provides $5 billion to jump-start State and local school construction
and renovation. After two percent of the funds are set aside for the Bureau ofIndian Affairs and the U.S.
territories, the remainder is made available as follows:

LOCAL DISTRICT ALLOCATION

One-half of the remaining available funds, $2.45 billion, is made available to fund applications submitted to the
Secretary of Education by the 100 local school districts with the greatest number of children living in poverty.

Of that $2.45 billion, 70 percent, or $1. 715 billion, will be made available to local districts on the same basis that.
they receive funds under the Federal government's major program for helping schools serving children from
low-income families (basic grants under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act). The data used for
the tables that follow are based on the 1990 Census count of low-income children. That data is being updated and
may be incorporated into the Title I allocations for FY 1998, causing some adjustments to the estimates provided
here.

The remaining 30 percent of the local allocation, or $735 million, will be awarded on a competitive basis to those
districts with particularly significant infrastructure needs that will use these funds most effectively in leveraging
non-Federal resources.

ST ATE ALLOCATION

The other half of the funds, $2.45 billion will be made available to the States based on the same Title I formula,
except that the qualifying children that live in local school districts that are eligible to apply directly for funds are
subtracted from the States' total number. (For example, the children living in poverty in Philadelphia were not
included in the calculation for the State of Pennsylvania, since Philadelphia would be eligible to apply for funds
directly to the Education Department). Again, the estimates may be adjusted in the next few months based on an
update of Census data.

In order to receive funds, States must survey their infrastructure needs (if they have not already done so) and provide
the Secretary of Education with an application describing how the funds will be distributed to localities with the
greatest need and with the greatest leveraging impact.                                                         .

THE PROBLEM

          Broward County is located in Southern Florida and is the fifth largest school district in the
nation.    Its schools suffer from severe overcrowding:

                34,000 students without permanent desks;
                Approximately 10,000 new students added to the school system each year; and
                In the past nine years, Broward has built 36 new schools and rebuilt 23 schools, and
                 continues to have a difficult time meeting its demand

        Broward would have to build a new school every month to meet this demand adequately.
Citing the approximately 2,000 portable classrooms in the county, the budget director for the county
public schools described Broward as "the portable capital of the world." One high school has 46
portable classrooms in use during this school year alone.



NEEDS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES

        A recent needs analysis estimated Broward's capital construction needs at $2.4 billion, $200
million of which is needed for technology improvements alone. The last bond approved for school
construction was for $317 million in 1987. Mobilizing local support for new tax or bond referenda
has been difficult. In fact, in September, 1995, a tax referendum to increase the sales tax by one
penny to raise $1 billion for school construction was defeated.



POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE PARTNERSHIP TO REBUILD AMERICA'S SCHOOLS ACT

        Under the President's legislative proposal, approximately $16.4 million would be allocated to
the county school district. Broward could use these funds to subsidize interest costs for a local bond
to cover a substantial part of the its school construction costs. This funding could support nearly $70
million in leveraged funds to assist in rebuilding a number of local schools.

         These new funds would be used primarily to ease overcrowding in schools by funding new
schools as well as renovations and additions to existing schools that would expand seating capacity.
Broward also wants to reduce its reliance on portable classrooms due to the fact that -- with a life
expectancy of approximately 20 years -- portables are not a good long-term investment compared to a
traditional school structure. In addition, portables cannot be wired for technology the same way as a
traditional classroom.
