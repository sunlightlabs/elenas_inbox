               Testimony of

             Donna E. Shalala

U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services

                Before the

         Senate Budget Committee



            February 11, 1999
                                                                        Autom8ted Recor d5,· ana",
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion



       Chainnan Domenici, Senator Lautenberg, and members of the Committee:

       It is with great pleasure that I appear before you today to discuss the President's fiscal

year 2000 budget for the Department of Health and Human Services.



       As the President said when he released his budget on February 1, the FY 2000 budget

charts a progressive but prudent path to our future. For the second year in a row, it is a balanced

budget that makes vital investments in the people ofthis country.



       Nowhere is that more evident than in the budget of the Department of Health and Human

Services. It is a budget designed to meet the very real challenges of the 21 st century. And it is a

budget that honors America's values without breaking America's bank.



       Our budget contains $400 billion in outlays, a 6.6 percent increase over the FY1999

budget approved by the Congress last year. Within that framework, we seek to keep some very

important promises to American families.



       The promise of retirement with dignity for all Americans.



       The promise of high-quality, affordable health care for every working Jamily.



       The promise of a safe and healthy childhood.




                                                 1
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


        And, the promise to mobilize America's scientific genius to make our country a healthier

and safer place to live.



       As we stand on the crest of the new century, the combination of our fiscal discipline, the

expanding economy, and the unprecedented advancement occurring in the scientific community

provide us with a unique opportunity to meet these challenges.



       Let me tum first to the needs of older Americans and those who are living with

disabilities. We all know that the number of Americans over the age of 65 will double by the

year 2030. Providing proper care to those who will be in that group is an essential part of

meeting the challenges of the new century. The President's long-term care initiative is an

important step toward that objective.



       Our proposal includes an historic $1,000 tax credit for people with long-term care needs

or their family members who welcome them into there own homes and provide them with care.

We estimate that this will help more than two million Americans, including over one million

older persons. But let me be clear, this initiative will not just help older Americans the tax

credit will also benefit large numbers of working age adults with disability as well as severely

disabled children.



       But a tax credit is not sufficient to meet all ofthe needs of older and disabled Americans.

That is why the HHS budget includes a $125 million annual investment by the Administration

on Aging in a new National Family Caregiver Support Program. This will provide direct

assistance to those who are caring for elderly relatives. We are also proposing a five-year $110

million expansion of the Home and Community-Based Care program that helps to expand

alternatives to institutional care for older and younger people with disabilities. And the Health

Care Financing Administration will launch a new $10 million national campaign t6 help inform

and educate Medicare beneficiaries about their own long-term care options.



       Taken together, we believe that these can be the first steps in a national effort to address

the very real needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens. We look forward to working with

members of both parties to assure quick approval of bipartisan legislation in this area.



       Mr. Chairman, I know that you and I and the members of the committee agree that one of

the cornerstones of our national commitment to older Americans is the Medicare program. In

the three and a half decades since this landmark program was enacted into law, the health and

security of our nation's senior citizens has markedly improved. We have raised both the length

and the quality of life for our parents and our grandparents. As we look ahead to the new

century, we owe it to the next generation of seniors -   including you and me -    to make sure that

Medicare remains a rock-solid guarantee of high-quality health care.



       To ensure that the promise of Medicare remains unbroken, the President has asked

Congress to earmark 15 percent of the projected budget surplus for Medicare over the next 15

years. Two years ago, we worked together to extend the solvency of the Hospital Insurance


                                                 3
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion




Trust Fund for another 10 years. The President's proposal to invest one in every six dollars of

the surplus in Medicare will assure solvency of the trust fund for an additional decade, keeping it

in the black until 2020.



       The President also believes that there are additional steps that we can and should take on

a bipartisan basis to modernize Medicare and achieve additional savings to strengthen the

program. Like you, we look forward to seeing the final recommendations of the National

Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. We also look forward to working with the

Congress to ensure that any steps we take in the future meet the four main principles the

President outlined last week: dedicate a portion ofthe surplus to secure Medicare until 2020;

modernize the Medicare program to make it more competitive and efficient; guarantee a defined

set of benefits without excessive new cost to beneficiaries; and use the savings from these

changes to help fund a prescription drug benefit.



       I am very proud of the work that the Department has done to reinvent the Health Care

Financing Administration. We have tried to transform HCFA from an agency that simply paid

the bills and rarely asked any questions into a prudent purchaser of health care services. We

have set tough new standards for quality and patient protection. We have worked hard to inform

and educate our customers about the new choices available to them. And we have worked with

the Congress to update the Medicare benefit package to include important preventive services

ranging from mammograms to bone density screening. We hope to work with Congress this


                                                4
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


year to ensure that HCFA has the statutory authority necessary to adopt the best management,

payment, and competitive practices used in the private sector.



        We will also continue the war we have fought against waste, fraud, and abuse in both

Medicare and Medicaid. With Operation Restore Trust we have instituted a policy of zero

tolerance toward those who would rip offthe Medicare program and its beneficiaries. The

President's budget continues those efforts by asking Congress, once again, to enact new steps to

fight fraud that will save the Medicare trust fund $2.9 billion over the next five years. Our

budget also includes $165 million to ensure that all of our computers are prepared for the year

2000.



        While we take care of older Americans, we also must make sure that we continue to assist

working families. An estimated 43 million Americans are living day to day without the

protection of health insurance. More than 80 percent of those uninsured people are full-time

workers and their dependents. Two years ago, we worked with the Congress on a bipartisan

basis to enact the historic Child Health Insurance Program. This year, we are asking the

Congress to take another important step toward reducing the number of uninsured in this country.

 We again propose to allow uninsured workers between the ages of62 and 65 to buy into

Medicare at an actuarially sound premium. We also want Americans between the ages of 55 and

62 who have lost their jobs and their insurance to have a similar opportunity.




                                                 5
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion


        The President also is proposing a tax credit for small businesses that seek to insure their

workers through a voluntary health insurance purchasing cooperative.



        Taken together, we anticipate that these proposals will reduce the number of Americans

who are living without health insurance.



        While we must do all that we can to reduce the number of uninsured, we also must pay

attention to the needs of those who remain uncovered. I am very proud of our new five-year $1

billion initiative to improve health care access for uninsured Americans. The money would go

to community health clinics, public hospitals, and academic health centers to help them establish

the infrastructure necessary to provide coordinated, comprehensive care for the working

uninsured. This is a relatively small investment but it is a vital one if we are to assure that all

Americans get high-quality care at .the right place at the right time.



       This new initiative will complement existing efforts to reach out to the uninsured and

provide them with the care they need. The President's budget also includes $945 million dollars

for two major programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration. An increase of

$20 million -    for community, migrant and other health centers and a total of$1.5 billion for

the Ryan White CARE Act, an increase of$100 million dollars over last year.



       We reaffirm our commitment to mental health, with a $70 million increase - a 24 percent

boost - in the mental health block grant to expand community-based programs.

       While we help millions of working Americans get health insurance, we also should help

millions of other Americans with insurance go back to work. Today, nearly 75 percent of

working-age Americans with disabilities are unemployed. One ofthe major reasons they are

staying out of the job market is their understandable fear of losing their health insurance -

specifically their Medicare and Medicaid coverage. Last year, we all came very close to

agreeing on landmark bipartisan legislation to allow Americans with disabilities to go back to

work and keep their health care coverage. This year, the President is determined that we

complete that task and pass a law allowing these men and women to take jobs and keep their

Medicare or Medicaid coverage.



       This budget provides the Indian Health Service with $2.8 billion, including $2.4 billion

for clinical, preventive, facilities and environme~tal health programs. That's a $170 million

increase over last year. And we're changing the Medicaid reimbursement rate, which will infuse

another $80 million into Indian Health Service over the next two years.



       Mr. Chairman, as you know I have spent most of my career as an educator and an

advocate for children. That is why I am so proud of the investments this budget makes in the

health and welfare of the youngest Americans.



       The President's child care initiative is a lifeline of support to working parents. It will

dramatically increase the availability of child care through grants to the states and investments in

improving the quality of child care in this country. The President is also proposing a $6.3

"                                                                             Hex-Dwnp Conversion


    billion tax credit over five years to help parents -   including mom or dads who choose to stay at

    home -    to afford to care for their children.



             And the budget includes $5.3 billion for the Head Start program to continue the

    wonderful progress we have made in reaching out to infants and toddlers.




                    As I mentioned earlier, we are making very good progress with the states in

    implementing the Child Health Insurance Program. As of January, 50 plans had been approved

    along with eight plan amendments. Our budget includes another $1.9 billion in federal funds to

    the states to provide coverage to uninsured children. It also proposes a five-year $1.2 billion

    initiative to reach out to eligible children and their families to make sure they are aware of the

    coverage that is available to them. As part of that we will allow states to use up to 3 percent of

    their CHIP money to perform outreach activities in addition to the 10 percent allotment for other

    administrative expenses.



             We are also proposing $50 million in grants to states to test new pediatric asthma

    management methods and another $40 million to support graduate medical education at our

    nation's children's hospitals.



             Every year, 20,000 young Americans age out of foster care when they turn 18. Too

    many of them are not yet ready to face the challenges of adult life. This budget invests in those

young people and gives them some of the basic skills they will need to survive and to thrive.

Part of that means making sure they are insured through Medicaid until they reach 21. At a cost

of only $50 million dollars over five years, we can do that. We must do that.



          It is impossible to talk about children's health without talking about tobacco. The

members of this Committee are very familiar with the statistics -     3,000 American kids begin

smoking every day and 1,000 of them will live shorter lives as a result. We must join together to

pass a comprehensive tobacco bill that puts cigarettes out of the reach of young people, helps to

teach them about the dangers of smoking, and confirm the FDA's authority over this deadly drug.

 The Department of Health and Human Services also will work with the Justice Department in

preparing federal litigation against tobacco companies to recoup the money spent on treating the

often deadly consequences oftobacco use.



          While we help young people to avoid the dangers of tobacco, we also must make sure that

they are fully immunized against the preventable diseases that are, fortunately, becoming

increasingly rare in this country. Working together we have made remarkable progress in

making sure that children are vaccinated at a young age. As a result, cases of polio, mumps,

tetanus, and measles are at an all-time low. Our budget allocates $1.1 billion to the CDC to

make further progress toward the goal of having all our children immunized.



          The final area I would like to discuss with you is our investment in science and public

health.

                                                                          Hex-Dllmp Conversion


       Our budget continues the bipartisan progress we are making toward meeting the

President's goal of increasing the budget for the National Institutes of Health by 50 percent over

five years. Last year, Congress enacted a 15 percent increase in the NIH budget and this year we

make another down payment on that commitment.




       We also are proposing, once again, to allow Medicare patients to enroll in cancer clinical

trials so that we can help bring new, effective cancer treatments to all Americans.



       We are investing in health care quality by increasing the budget of the Agency for Health

Care Research and Policy by $35 million to $206 million. This is a major commitment to

ensuring that the medical break throughs our scientists create are translated into measurable

improvements in the health of the American people.



       Improvement in health must also go hand in hand with providing a sense of security to

Americans in their everyday life. Therefore, the threat that exists today of biological terrorism is

one that we must take seriously. Bioterrorism is not just a problem for the military or for law

enforcement, it's a problem for the entire public health and medical community. That's why this

budget proposes a $72 million increase for medical and public health response and preparedness

for bioterrorism.   This amount allows us to improve surveillance, strengthen local medical

response systems and expand research on biological and chemical agents.

        Part of this increase will provide $65 million for bioterrorism and emergency response,

including development and implementation of a national electronic disease surveillance system at

CDC. This network will create a critical link to track influenza, food-borne illnesses, and other

infectious diseases.




        In addition, we are proposing a 19 percent increase in the budget of the Food and Drug

Administration, the largest increase in recent years.



        The requested increase comes at a critical time for the agency, which has been given

many important new responsibilities in recent years but has not been given corresponding

increases in its budget. Under the new leadership of Commissioner Henney, the Food and Drug

Administration will be carrying out high-priority initiatives to improve the safety of the nation's

food supply, to protect our children from becoming addicted to tobacco products, to ensure the

safety and adequacy of the blood supply, and to strengthen agency's scientific capabilities.



       Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, I have put before you today a blueprint for

health and social service systems to meet the challenges ofthe new millennium. The goals of

making health and happiness the defining characteristic of our seniors retirement, of providing a

better future for our children, and of enabling all Americans to live longer and healthier lives are

ones that we all share.    And like you, I am committed to achieving these goals while

maintaining the balanced budget discipline we have all worked so hard to create.
