                                  FACT SHEET
      President Clinton's Petition To The Federal Election CommissionTo
                                Ban 'Soft Money'
                                           April _, 1997


        Today, the President petitioned the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to revisit its rules
on 'soft money' and act to ban the use of soft money in federal elections, as proposed in
bipartisan campaign fi!1ance reform legislation now before Congress. The petition proposes to
end the current soft money system by requiring that candidates for federal office and national
parties only be permitted to raise and spend 'hard money' -- funds subject to the restrictions,
contribution limits, and reporting requirements of the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act
(FECA). This ban would apply to all political party committees, as anticipated by the
bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation.


'Soft money' and federal elections

        Soft money plays an increasingly large role in funding political parties and campaigns.
So-called hard money contributions are those that are given to candidates or parties subject to the
limits and disclosure offederal law. Soft money, on the other hand, goes to national or state
political parties, and can be raised in large amounts and from sources that could not give under
federal election law (directly from corporations and unions).

      The role of soft money has grown dramatically in the past several elections. In 1996, the
Democratic Party raised $123 million, and the Republican Party raised $138 million in soft
money -- more than triple the total of four years before.

        Soft money is today lawful under a series of regulations put forward by the Federal
Election Commission (FEC). The FEC first issued advisory opinions on this in 1978. It did not
take further action during the 1980's, as the role of soft money grew. In 1990, ordered to take
some action on soft money by a federal court, the FEC promulgated regulations that govern how
parties can allocate funds between federal and non-federal activities. (The court deferred to the
agency as to how to address the issue, but noted that the agency could go as far as to ban the use
of soft money for mixed federal- and state-political activity.)

     In addition, the 1979 statutory amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act
(FECA) authorized allocation of national and state hard money for joint activities.

President Clinton's support for a soft money ban

     President Clinton has consistently called for legislation that would ban the use of soft
money in federal elections. He called for this legislation during the 1992 campaign, and
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

supported the campaign finance reform legislaiton thatt was vetoed that year by President Bush
(which would have banned soft money). The campaign finance reform plan he proposed in May
1993 included a soft money ban; this proposal was passed by both chambers but was killed by a
Senate filibuster in 1994.

        The bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation introduced by Senators McCain and
Feingold and Representatives Shays and Meehan would prohibit the use of soft money in federal
elections.

       In January, 1993, the Democratic National Committee voluntarily announced that it
would restrict contributions it can currently accept under the law. It would not accept soft
money contributions in excess of $100,000 per year, and it would not accept contributions from
individuals who are not citizens or from domestic subsidiaries of foreign corporations.

Contents of the request to the FEe

        The President will call on Congress to enact the bipartisan legislation to reform campaign
financing and ban soft money. In the meantime, he is formally requesting the FEC to act now,
under existing law, to write new regulations banning the use of soft money to influence federal
elections, as envisioned in the legislation. Specifically, the President is requesting that the
Commission consider new rulemaking to accomplish the follo\-\;'ing:

      Prohibit national political parties (and their congressional campaign committees or agents)
       from soliciting or receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of
       FECA. (This would preclude, for example, contributions directly from corporate or
       union treasuries, or contributions from individuals in excess of the amount an individual
       can give to a national parties federal account.)

      Prohibit any federal officeholder or candidate (and their agents) from soliciting or
       receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of FECA.

      Provide that any amount of funds expended by a political party during a federal election
       year for any activity that influences a federal election (including any voter registration or
       get-out-the-vote drive, generic advertising, or any communication that refers to a federal
       candidate) must be paid for from funds subject to FECA. (This would end the
       allocation system, currently authorized by the FEC, under which hard and soft money are
       mixed for campaign activities that affect both state and federal elections.)

                                     Low UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES RISING AGAIN

                                                                       Apnl4, 1997
MARCH'S JOBS REPORT POINTS TO CONTINUED STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW
INFLATION UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS LOW, JOB GROWTH IS STRONG, AND REAL WAGES ARE
RISING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE.
  Unemployment Remains Low -- At 5.2%.
          The March unemployment rate was still at an historically low level of 5.2 -- its 31st consecutive
           month below 6. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5 , [Source: BLS,]
          The combined rate of unemployment and inflation has been lower under President Clinton than any
           other Administration since Lyndon Johnson was President. [Source: Based on data from BLS,]

  Real Wages Are Rising Again.
          Today's news shows that over the past 12 months, average hourly wages have increased 4.0 -- well
           outpacing the rate of inflation, which means real wage increases for America's workers. [Source: BLS,]
          Today's number confirms what Business Week (8/12/96) wrote last year: "[F]or the first time in more
           than a decade, real wages are showing sustained increases ... "

  11.9 MiJJjon New Jobs.
        We already have nearly over 700,000 new jobs so far in 1997, and 2.7 million over the past year.
        During the Clinton Administration, the economy has added 11.9 million new jobs -- a faster annual rate
         of job growth than any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s. [Source: Based on data from the
         Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]

  Strong Private-Sector Job Growth.
    Over the past year, the private sector has added 2.5 million jobs -- almost twice the private-sector jobs
        than during the entire four-year period before President Clinton took office. [Source: Based on data from BLS,]
    93 percent of the 11.9 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector. [Source:

        After losing 667,000 jobs in constnlction during the previous four years, 1,100,000 new construction jobs have
         been added since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S Truman
         was President.
        After losing 35,000 jobs in the auto industry during the Bush years, we have 107,000 new auto jobs since
         President Clinton took office. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey,]
