This is the issue you asked about regarding the recent cr~S1S in Florida
where insurance providers were threatening to cancel homeowner's insurance
for those persons who provide child care in their homes.   It seems that
this problem has arisen in other states as well with several states
passing legislation to deal with this problem.  Let me know if you need

RE:           INSURANCE FOR HOME CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

DATE:         JULY 29, 1997

SUMMARY

       Recently, there was a problem in Florida with insurance companies canceling
homeowner's insurance policies for persons who provided child care in their homes. This
problem reached crisis levels in Florida because the state's insurance company, known as the
Joint Underwriting Association, which is a last-chance insurer for many persons, was planning
on denying coverage to people providing day care in their homes. Apparently, this is a
widespread problem that often does not rise to the surface for several reasons, including the
following:

       . (1) Many insurers simply don't know that their policyholders provide child care in
their homes;
         (2) Insurance coverage only affects those who provide child care to a certain
minimum number of children, usually above 3 to 5 children; and
         (3) Many child care providers are able to locate insurance from a few insurers.

HOW THIS AFFECTS OTHER AREAS

      Welfare. Home child care facilities are often the main solution for welfare moms who
       are about to enter the workforce under the new welfare law. For instance, Larry
       Pintacuda, chief of child-care services for the Florida Department of Children and
       Families, believes that the insurance companies' restrictions on the number of children
       would seriously jeopardize Florida's welfare-reform efforts to solve a shortage of infant,
       evening and weekend care. Pintacuda believes that thousands of poor children will be
       without affordable day care if the state can't expand the number of neighborhood-based
       child care homes.

      Mortgages. Even if home child care providers obtain separate business liability
       insurance, their homeowner's insurance still might be canceled. Many mortgage
       companies require homeowner's policies.

SOME STATES THAT HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS

    California. California passed legislation that an insurance company can't cancel a
     person's homeowner's insurance simply because that person provides home child care
     services.

    Florida. A few weeks ago, a crisis developed because the state's insurance company,
     the Joint Underwriting Association, was threatening to deny homeowner's coverage to
     those persons providing child care services in their homes to more than three children.
     Solution: Florida is in the process of negotiating that policies would be issued only to
     registered and licensed family child-care homes. There are about 7,600 licensed and
     registered family child-care homes in Florida, but state law does not require them to carry
     liability insurance.

   . Minnesota. Minnesota passed legislation that immunizes insurance companies from
      liability under a homeowner's policy to those persons operating child care facilities out of
      the home. The insurance company's liability, if at all, would stem from a separate
      business insurance rider.

    Oregon. Oregon passed legislation that prohibits insurers from canceling or refusing to
     issue or renew homeowner's or renters' liability insurance or fire insurance solely
     because the policy holder is a family day care provider.

    Washington. Washington passed legislation intended to remedy the problem of the
     unavailability ofliability insurance for day care providers by requiring all insurers
     authorized to write commercial or professional liability insurance to be members of a
     joint underwriting association created to provide liability insurance for day care
     providers.

BACKGROUND

    Business liability insurance costs approximately $300-$500.

    In many states, such as Minnesota, there are only one or two insurance companies that
                                                                                  will provide
                                                                                  the type of
                                                                                  coverage
                                                                                  needed by
                                                                                  home day care
                                                                                  facilities.
