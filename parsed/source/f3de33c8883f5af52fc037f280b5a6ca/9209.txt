                                       *DRAFT*

Today, in remarks to students, parents and teachers at Hillcrest Elementary School in Orlando, Florida,
President Clinton called on Congress to act immediately to pass his education initiatives to strengthen
public education; and announced the release of a report on the trends in reading and math achievement
scores of 4th graders in high-poverty schools, and of $16 million in federal school safety grants to enable
schools to partner with law enforcement to improve safety and discipline in schools.

4TH GRADE MATH AND READING ACHIEVEMENT. The U.S. Department of Education
released a report on student achievement in high poverty schools on the 4th grade math and reading on the
National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP). The report analyzes the most-recently available math
and reading scores. Student achievement data reveal that students in schools with concentrated poverty
tend to begin school academically behind their low-poverty peers and are often unable to close this gap as
they progress through school. The report examines trends in this long-standing gap in academic
performance between students in high-poverty and low-poverty schools.

      Math scores show significant achievement gains in for 4th grade students across all levels of school
       poverty from 1992-1996. In high-poverty schools, the percentage of 4th graders that scored at
       least at the basic level was 42 percent in 1996, up from 26 percent in 1992. Twenty-seven states
       showed significant gains for 4th grade math students in high-poverty schools.

      Achievement gap in math narrowing. In 1996, students in high-poverty schools scored an average
       of 22 points below their peers in low-poverty schools -- this is down from a 28 point gap in 1992
       and a 24-point gap in 1994.

      4th Grade Reading scores remained relatively flat from 1992-1994. Five states demonstrated
       significant gains in reading for 4th grade students in high-poverty schools.

      Achievement gap in reading shows slight improvement. The average difference in reading
       achievement between high poverty and low poverty schools is higher than in math -- the gap was 38
       points in 1996, but it is down from a gap of 40 points in 1994.

GIVING SCHOOLS THE TOOLS TO HELP EVERY CHILD MEET HIGH STANDARDS ..
President Clinton reiterated his call on Congress to pass his education agenda and will fight for full fuming
for programs and new initiatives to help all children reach challenging academic standards, strengthen
accountability, provide access to technology, improve the quality of teaching, expand Head Start and after
school programs, and make our schools sac and drug free.

        Voluntary National Standards and Tests President Clinton is calling for voluntary national standards
       and tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math, to help students master the basic skills and to give
       parents, communities and educaors accurate information on how well our students perform. In
       order to close the achievement gap, we have to set the same high standards for all children.

       Education Opportunity Zones. President Clinton is urging Congress to strengtren schools in high
       poverty communities by providing funds to school districts that are raising student achievement and
       implementing accountability for results by ending social promotions and requiring students to meet

                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
      removing ineffective teachers; and turning around failing schools.

      Reduce Class Size The President is pressing Congress to enact his proposal to reduce class size to a
      national average of 18 in grades 1-3, by helping local schools hire an additional 100,000
      well-prepared teachers. Research shows that smaller classes increase student achievement and have
      the greatest impact on the academic achievement of disadvantaged stuc!nts.

      Helping Every Eight-Year Old Learn To Read President Clinton is continuing to work with
      Congress to enact a child literacy bill to ensure that children receive quality instruction from
      well-trained teachers and have opportunities to develop their reading skills with trained tutors
      after-school and on the weekend.

      Strengthening And Expanding Charter Schools President Clinton is working with Congress to pass
      bipartisan legislation to strengthen federal support for the growing charter school movemnt.

      Teacher Preparation and Recruitment. President Clinton is urging Congress to pass the
      Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, including his initiative to strengthen teacher
      preparation programs and recruitment of well-prepared teachers for underserved high-poverty
      schools.

      Modernizing Our Schools   The President is calling for federal tax credits to help renovate,
      modernize, and build over 5,000 public schools nationwide.

      Extra Support for Students in High Poverty Schools (Title I). The President is pressing
      forward with his request for additional support to help 520,000 students in high poverty schools
      meet challenging academic standards. The House bill cuts the President's request by $392 million,
      the Senate bill adds $301 million Dler FY 1998, but remains $91 million below the President's
      request.

LEADING AN EFFORT TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS SAFE
  New resources to create safer schools The President will highlight $16.4 million in grants to 155 law
  enforcement agencies released earlier today by the Justice Department COPS Office under the new
  School-Based Partnerships grant program. The School-Based Partnerships grants will be used by
  policing agencies to work with schools and community-based organizations to address crime at and
  around schools.

  Bringing community policing to combat and prevent school crime. The School-Based Partnerships
  program emphasizes using principles of community policing and problem-solving methods to address
  the causes of school-related crime. The grants will help to forge or strengthen partnerships between
  local law enforcement and schools to focus on school crime and disorder problems such as drug
  dealing and use on school grounds, assaults, threats, vandalism, and other studet safety issues.
