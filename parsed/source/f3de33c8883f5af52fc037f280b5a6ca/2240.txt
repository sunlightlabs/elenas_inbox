                                 Peace Officers Memorial
                                      May 15, 1997

Announcements
At today's Peace Officers Memorial, President Clinton made two new anti-crime announcements
of concern to law enforcement:

1) Leading by Example on Gun Safety. Consistent with his March 5, 1997 directive,
President Clinton reported that all FBI and ATF agents-- nearly 13,000, or 20% of all federal law
enforcement officers-- have now been provided child safety locks to prevent accidental or
unauthorized use of their firearms. The remaining federal law enforcement officers will be
provided with child safety locks no later than October 15, 1997.

2) Strengthening Brady. President Clinton announced that the Treasury Department has sent
out revised versions of Form 4473 ("Brady" form) to all federal gun dealers, helping to ensure
that only legitimate and eligible residents of a state are able to purchase firearms.

Child Safety Locks on Firearms
      Every day, firearms claim the lives too many children. In 1994, 185 accidental deaths by
       gunshot involved children age 14 and younger. Many of these deaths could have been
       prevented. A child safety lock can prevent a child from hurting themselves or someone
       else, or render a gun useless to a thief. These simple devices cost as little as just over $4
       each. Asking the federal government to lead by example, the President directed his
       agencies to issue child safety locks to all" federal law enforcement officers.

Revised Brady Form
     In response to the tragic Empire State Building shooting by a foreign visitor in February
       1997, the President asked Secretary Rubin to review options to restrict gun access to
      foreign visitors and to tighten up residency requirements. Prior to the revisions, the 4473
      form-- which all firearms purchasers must complete-- did not require gun purchasers to
      affirmatively give their State of residence, or require information documenting a
      noncitizen's residence in the State for the 90-day period, as required by federal regulation.

      The new forms require purchasers to make an affirmative statement that they reside in the
       state of the gun dealer; and in the case of noncitizens, show secondary forms of
       identification to prove state residency, such as a utility bill or lease.

Clinton Administration's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy
      The President's strategy seeks to break the back of violent gangs, reduce youth violence
       and provide our kids with alternatives to steer them away from gangs, guns and drugs. In
       addition to requiring federal gun dealers to provide child safety locks with every gun they
       sell, his strategy includes $200 million for local prosecutors and anti-gang task forces;
       extends the Brady Law to prevent violent juveniles from ever purchasing a gun; and
       provides funding for afterschool programs to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble.
