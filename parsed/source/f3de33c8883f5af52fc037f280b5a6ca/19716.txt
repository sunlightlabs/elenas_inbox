I.     INTRODUCTION

II.    A MOMENT OF UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY

        President Clinton's three-part economic strategy -- fiscal responsibility, investing in our people,
opening new markets to American goods and services -- is working for America's families. In the first
quarter of \998, the economy grew at a strong annual rate of 4.2 percent; unemploymerit was the lowest in
28 years; inflation was the lowest in more than 30 years; consumer confidence reached its highest level in
a generation; and for five years in a row, America's economy was rated the most competitive in the world.

             The country is in good shape. We should not start to feel complacent, take our eye off the
ball or become more small minded when we ought to becqme more large minded and more visionary.
The Administration has proven that the size of government can be reduced and the budget can be balanced
while our nation continues to invest more in education, health care and the environment.

              Partnerships can be created with the business community while still being compassionate
towards working people. More jobs can be created while still giving people the support they need like
child care to succeed with their families at home.

              But all that means is that more people have good life stories to tell. And, yet, if we think
about the dynamism of this time -- it's not true that the society is changing as fast or as profoundly as the
Internet is growing, for example. But it's changing about as fast or as profoundly as a human organism
can change. And, therefore, we need to think about the future and what we're doing to prepare for this
new century we're about to enter.

III.   GROWING THE ECONOMY THROUGH FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY

              First of all, it's important to keep the economy growing. It may be that technology with
good economic conditions will permit a higher level of growth for a longer period of time at lower levels
of inflation than we had previously thought. That may be true. It will only be true if we are responsible.
 And one of the things that has been most gratifying has been the public response to the Administration's
insistence that we not start spending the surplus before it materializes. We've had a deficit for 30 years
and as soon as the new year came around everyone had great ideas for how to spend the projected surplus.

              We have eliminated the structural deficit and we will have a balanced budget this year -- if
not this year, certainly next year. And it has been projected that we will have surpluses for several years
thereafter, more than a decade. And because there is no structural deficit in the budget--that is, even if
the economy slows down, and when the economy slows down you get less tax money and you have to put
more out because there are more people unemployed--but over time, ifthere's no structural deficit we will
still have a balanced budget to a large surplus, depending on growth.


             There are a lot of people who want to start spending the surplus right now in taX cuts or
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
spending programs, and we should do neither. We certainly should not do it until it materializes. And
we should not do it until we have dealt with the long-tenn financial problems with the Social Security
system. We have some significant decisions to make.

                                     SOCIAL SECURITY / MEDICARE
         The President's goal for this year is to have a non-partisan national process by which we discuss
all the alternatives that are out there available for Social Security and then early next year Congress passes
legislation which will take care of the long-tenn stability of the system. Simultaneously, no matter what
option we choose, by 2029 when the present trust fund is expected to run out of money and start costing
more money than Americans are paying every year in taxes, we will have to do some significant things.
But no matter what we do, not now and not then will Social Security be enough for most Americans -- the
vast, vast majority of Americans -- to maintain the standard of living they enjoy once they retire.
Therefore, we also have to find ways for people to save more and to prepare more for their own
retirement. So we're going to be looking at a lot of interesting ideas in the Social Security system. And I
hope all of you will enter that debate.

            There was a public opinion survey done last year which showed that most people under 25
thought it was more likely that they would see a UFO than that they would ever draw a penny of Social
Security. We have to somehow reverse that perception.

              We have a simultaneous effort going on now with Medicare. We have more than a decade
of life on the Medicare trust fund. But, again, the pure demographics of the baby boom retirements, the
fact that we are living longer and accessing more high tech medicine mean that we're going to have to
make some changes in Medicare if we expect it to sustain itself well into the next century.

              The good these programs have done should not be underestimated. In 1985, for the first
time in the history of our country, the poverty rate among people over 65 was lower than the poverty rate
of people under 65. When Social Security was inaugurated, over 70 percent of the American people over
65 were living in poverty. Many of them were living in abject poverty. This is a terrific achievement for
our country. We do not want to give up this signal achievement that is really a mark of a decent society.
And, yet, in order to avoid it we're going to have to plan for it and deal with the fact that when the baby
boomers retire the Social Security and Medicare systems are going to change subsfantially.

            Everyone of the baby boomers is haunted by the idea that when they retire, an unwarranted
financial burden will be imposed on their children and on their children's ability to raise their
grandchildren in order to for them to be taken care of by Social Security and Medicare. No one wants
that. So we have an opportunity now to take relatively modest steps that will have relatively huge
impacts in the years to come.

IV.    EDUCATION

             This country has a lot of work to do in education. Our goal is to have every classroom and
library hooked up to the Internet by the year 2000. We're making good progress. But consider the
anomaly in the United States. Most Americans now qualify for a $1,500 tax credit, tax reduction for the
first two years of college and a tax credit for junior and senior year in graduate school. And there are
more Pell Grant scholarships at higher income levels. There are education lRAs, you can deduct the
interest on the student loan. The people that are in our direct loan program can get cheaper college loans
with better repayment tenns. There are 300,000 more work study slots.
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


              It is literally true today that if you are willing to work for it, you can go to college. And
community college is virtually free now. For people who go to community colleges, the $1,500 tax
deduction covers all of the tuition for about 80 percent of the community colleges in the country. And
there is a great sense of achievement there. Why? Because people know it really means something to
have higher education in America. And they know we have the best system of higher education in the
world.

             Yet, no one believes we have the best system of elementary and secondary education in the
world. The results of the Third International Math and Science Survey, which is given to thousands of
high school seniors, showed that out of 21 countries, the United States scored 19th. Eighth graders were
in the middle, but fourth graders were tied for second.

            It is no longer acceptable to say, well, what do you expect considering 20 percent of our kids
are in poverty. This is not rocket science. All kids can learn. All of us can learn 100 percent of what
we need to know to make a society go, otherwise democracies would all fail. And it would have
happened long ago.

              We have to have more standards, more emphasis on teaching and a lot of other reforms in
America's schools. We have a big program out there now to lower class sizes and do a number of other
things in this session of Congress. President Clinton is committed to spending a huge amount of effort in
the next three years to do what he has spent hisentire public life working on, and that is trying to give
Americans the best elementary and secondary system in the world. We are kidding ourselves if we think
we can really build a truly meritocratic society if all of our children are unable to get a quality education in
our schools.             .

V.      ENVIRONMENT

             The environment has great relevance to the future. Compared to five years ago, the air is
cleaner, the water is cleaner, there are fewer toxic waste dumps and the food supply is safer. And we
have set aside more land to be saved than any administration in the history of the country, except the
administrations of Theodore and Franklin Rooscvelt. Also, we are working on saving Lake Tahoe.

               But there is still a great deal to be done, and on two issues in particular which will affect the
quality oflife in California. The first is with regard to clean water. The Clean Water Act, which was
passed 25 years ago, was designed to deal with pollution mostly coming out of sewage systems and out of
industrial activities -- so-called point source pollution. Forty percent of our waterways in America are
still not pure enough to swim and fish in because of non-point pollution -- things that run off from the
land. The Administration has a new clean water initiative to deal with these environmental concerns.

             The other thing that is imperative that we get on is --EI Nino -- the climate change
phenomenon. It is real, and we must do what we can to meet America's responsibility to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. We can do that and still grow the economy. Every time the Administration
has had to face a clean air or clean water issue, people have assumed that addressing it will shut the
economy down. And every time we have done it, it has given the economy a boost by opening up a
whole new area of high tech jobs that were not available before.

             A third of all Carbon Dioxide emissions come from transportation; a third come from
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

buildings, homes and office buildings; and a third come from manufacturing plants and electric
generators. Technology is now available, right now, to reduce substantially our greenhouse gas emissions
-- with available technology that pays out in two to three years, with regard to buildings, office buildings,
homes, manufacturing facilities and electric generators. And with the new fuel injection engines that are
being developed for automobiles with the hybrid electric in fuel and gasoline engines, within two or three
years Americans are going to see automobiles that have literally one-fourth to one-fifth of greenhouse gas
emissions of today's automobiles.

VI_    MILLENNIUM

            The Millennium Council has been crafted by the First Lady and its premise is to spend this
year creating a gift to the millennium that would be part respecting the past and part imagining the future.
The respecting of the past part is the restoration of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of
Independence and the Star-Spangled Banner. The First Lady also hopes to get people in every
community in the country to do an inventory of the historic things that they may have in their possession.

               For example, there is a place called the Old Sbldiers Home in Washington, D.C., that was
built before the Civil War. And on the Old Soldiers Home there is a cabin that is almost totally
dilapidated, and it is where Abraham Lincoln's family lived every summer. It would not cost that much
to restore it. Every single community in this country has places in it that tell the part of America's story,
and they have to be preserved.

            But we also have to recognize that in the years we were running these huge deficits, we
wound up under-investing in a lot of things we should have invested more in, principally research. So the
Administration has also offered the biggest research budget in the history of the country in this balanced
budget. We need all of you to help us pass it because it is a big part of our future.

VII.   ONE AMERICA

             The work being done by the President's Initiative on Race and the Administration to bring
America together across all the lines that divide us, to have everyone judged based on their merit, to give
everyone a chance, and to build a country that is a stunning contrast to the racial, ethnic and religious
conflicts that are beleaguering the world has been a part of President Clinton's vision of One America.

               America has a strong economy and can always be on the forefront of every new thing that
happens. But in the end, we have to prove that we can be one nation together. The people that came
here to start this country came here because they literally deplored the unlimited, arbitrary, abusive
exercise of power over the lives of citizens. And they had a better idea. They said, we want to be free
and we want to be free to pursue happiness -- not have it guaranteed to us--free to pursue it; and in the
process, we will work to form a more perfect union.

VIII. CONCLUSION

II                                                        WOMEN                                                                   II
     EXPANDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES:
      Passed the Family & Medical Leave Act (FMLA), enabling workers to take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave to care for a
       new baby or ailing family member without jeopardizing their job. Approximately fifteen million workers have already
       benefited from FMLA since its enactment.
      Narrowed the wage gap, Last year, the median earnings of women working full-time increased 2.4%. In 1996, the
        median earnings of women represented 74% of the median earnings for men, the narrowest gap ever.
      Women are starting businesses at twice the rate of all businesses. There are nearly 8 million women-owned businesses.in
        the U.S., generating nearly $2.3 trillion in sales.
      Tripled the Number of Small Business Loans to Women Entrepreneurs. Between 1993 and 1997 the SBA approved
        nearly 50,000 loans to women entrepreneurs under the 7(a) and 504 loan programs. Last year alone, the Small Business
       Administration granted more than 10,000 loans, worth $1.67 billion, to women small business owners, triple the number
       ofloans granted in 1992.

     MAKING OUR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES SAFER:
      Championed the Violence Against Women Act to fight domestic violence, and created an office at the Department of
       Justice dedicated to combating violence against women.
      More than tripled funding to domestic violence shelters and instituted new penalties against men who stalk, threaten or
       abuse women across state lines.
      Established nationwide 24-hour domestic violence hotline. The hotline (1-800-797-SAFE) provides immediate crisis
       intervention, counseling and referrals for those in need.

     CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN:
      Held First-Ever White House Conference on Child Care and White House Conference on Early Child Development and
       Learning. The President and First Lady highlighted the benefits of early nurturing by parents and the child care
       challenges facing parents--availability, affordability, and assuring safety and quality--in these conferences.

     IMPROVING WOMEN'S HEALTH:
      Increased funding for breast cancer research. Under President Clinton, funding for breast cancer research, prevention
        and treatment has nearly doubled, from about $276 million in FY'93 to $513 million in the President's FY'98 budget.
      Endorsed legislation banning drive-thru mastectomies, allowing women to stay in the hospital at least 48 hours
        following a mastectomy.                                           .
      Ended drive-thru deliveries. Proposed and signed into law legislation requiring insurers to cover at least 48 hours of a
        post-natal hospital stay (72 hours for a Caesarean).

     PROMOTING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES FOR WOMEN:
      Reversed the "Gag Rule" limiting the information federally funded family planning clinics could give to women.
      Increased funding for Title X. The President's FY'99 proposal increases Title X Family Planning grants by $15
       million -- a 46% increase since FY'92.
      Signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, establishing a safety-zone around women's health clinics.

     WOMEN AS PARTNERS IN DECISION MAKING:
      41 % of Administration appointees are women, the highest percentage appointed by any previous President. Women hold
       29% of the top positions requiring Senate confirmation.                                                      .
      Appointed the first women ever to serve as Attorney General, Janet Reno, and Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright.
       Including the Attorney General and Secretary of State, women make up 27% of the Clinton Cabinet: Alexis Herman,
       Secretary of Labor; Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services; Carol Browner, Administrator of the
       Environmental Protection Agency: Janet Yellen, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors; and Charlene Barchevsky,
       United States Trade Representative.
      A third of all judicial nominees are women, the highest proportion ever.
      Nominated the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court. During his first year in office, President Clinton
       nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the United States Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg is only the second woman to
       serve on the nation's highest court.

                                            TOBACCO

                     "The facts are as plain as the stakes are high: Three thousand children begin to
          smoke every day, even though it's illegal in every state, and 1,000 will die earlier because
          of it. All these children have been targeted by a massive, multimillion톎ollar media
          campaign that preys on their insecurities and their dreams ... We are fighting for the lives
          of our children. We are fighting for the public health, and we are fighting against
          predatory practices by tobacco companies that have targeted our children. "

                                                                         President Bill Clinton

CLEAR FACTS, HIGH STAKES. 3,000 children begin to smoke every day; 1,000 of them will die
early as a result. The President is committed to passing comprehensive legislation to stop young
Americans from smoking before they start, in an effort that can save one million lives over the
next five years.

A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR FuTURE TOBACCO REFORM. President Clinton believes that
Senator McCain and Senator Hollings' tobacco legislation bill, which passed the Commerce
Committee, is a strong step in the right direction on the road to passing comprehensive tobacco
legislation this year.                     .

STANDING STRONG FOR COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. The tobacco industry is working to
persuade Congress to pass weaker legislation that will not reduce teen smoking. We rrlust
continue to work with Senator McCain and others to make reducing teen smoking the
tobacco industry's bottom line.

A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR REDUCING YOUTH TOBACCO USE. President Clinton's plan for
comprehensive tobacco legislation includes five key principles:

      A comprehensive plan to reduce youth smoking by raising the price of packs of
       cigarettes by up to $1.50 over ten years through a combination of annual
       payments arid tough penalties o~ the tobacco industry;

      Full authority for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco
       products;

      Changes in the way the. tobacco industry does business, including ending
       marketing and promotion to kids;

      Progress toward other public health goals, including biomedical and cancer
       research, a reduction of second-hand smoke, promotion of smoking cessation
       programs, and other urgent priorities; and

      Protection for tobacco farmers and their communities.

                 ONE AMERICA ACCOMPLISHMENTS
CIVIL RIGHTS

   New Civil Rights Enforcement: President Clinton's budget plan contains $602 million for civil rights
    enforcement agencies and offices -- an mcrease of $86 million, or more than 16 percent, over last
    year's funding -- the largest single increase in the enforcement of civil rights laws in nearly two
    decades.
   New reforms and heightened commitment to civil rights enforcement: The Administration is
    working to prevent discrimination before it occurs, and punish those who do discriminate in
    employment, in education, in housing, in health care, and in access for those with disabilities.

EDUCATION

   Getting Good Teachers Into Underserved Areas. President Clinton's education plan includes a
    $350 million program to attract talented people of all backgrounds to teach at low-income schools
    across the nation and to dramatically improve the quality of training and preparation given to our
    future teachers.
   Hispanic Education Action Plan. The President's budget proposal includes funding for a national
    action plan to help Latino youngsters master the basics of reading and math; learn English; stay in
    school; and prepare for college; it also helps Hispanic adults learn English, and expands educational
    opportunities for migrants.
   Mentoring America's Youth: President Clinton is proposing the High Hopes톓nitiative to help teach
    students how they should go to college by informing them about college options, academic
    requirements, costs, and fmancial aid, and by providing support services -- including tutoring,
    counseling, and mentoring.
   Creating "Education Opportunity Zones." President Clinton is expanding opportunities for
    students in high-poverty school districts, by making their schools eligible for additional Federal
    funding, if they (1) adopt tough reform measures making staff and students accountable for success
    or failure, and (2) show real improvement in student achievement.

BUSINESS

   Supporting Minority Business Communities. Preisdcnt Clinton has a plan to increase lending and
    business services to the African American business community nationwide. Through this plan, SBA
    is committed to more than doubling the amount of capital and credit the community receives.

    enforcement of existing laws preventing housing discrimination that doubles the number of civil rights
  . enforcement actions by the year 2000 to respond to the increase in reported cases of serious
    fair-housing violations.

HEALTH

   Eliminating Ethnic Health Disparities. President Clinton announced a new initiative that sets a
    national goal of eliminating by the year 2010, longstanding disparities in health status that affect racial
    and ethnic minority groups.

ENCOURAGING DIALOGUE

   Including all Americans in the national conversation on race. As part of his One America
    Initiaitive, the President and his Race Initiative Advisory Board are actively involved in public
    outreach efforts to engage Americans across the nation in this historic effort. April 1998 was
    designated as a "Month of Dialogue," involving hundreds of race-related events across the nation. On
    Apri130, 41 governors, 21 mayors and over 100 YWCA's participated in a special "Statewide Days of
    Dialogue" event.

LEADING BY EXAMPLE

   Highlighting Promising Practices. One of the critical elements of the Race Initiative is that local
    communities are the source of some of the best ideas and successful programs. The Race Initiative is
    compiling and assessing informaticin on "promising practices," which are examples of communities and
    organizations that have ideas and programs that are working to help bring people together as One
    America. To date,    no  such promising practices have been identified, and the list continues to grow.


RECRUITING LEADERS

   Creating Historic Partnerships. On February 19, 1998, Vice President Gore and SBA Administrator
    Alvarez announced an unprecedented agreement with the "Big Three" U.S. automakers that will
    increase subcontracting awards to minority businesses by nearly $3 billion over the next 3 years -- a 50
    percent increase over current levels.
   Mobilizing Business Leaders. On April 2, 1998, Vice President Gore announced a business
    roundtable series during an appearance on Black Entertainment Television. This series will be chaired
    by the Vice president and will consist of four meetings with business leaders to discuss issues
    involving minorities and business.
   Partnering With Universities. Nearly a quarter of America's colleges and universities have agreed to
    partner with the Race Initiative to encourage every college and university to conduct special programs
    focusing on race and other dimensions of diversity in American society.
   Reaching Out To Religious Leaders. Reverend Suzan Johnson Cook of the Advisory Board is leading
    the Race Initiative's efforts to organize the national faith community so that they too can play an
    integral part in the effort.

FOCUSING ON YOUTH

   Call To Action To Young Leaders. On November 28, 1997, the President reached out to 25,000
    high school senior class presidents, college and university class presidents, and other young leaders
    from national and local organizations and issued a call to action, asking these young people to each
    commit to participating in at least one project aimed at moving our country closer together. Hundreds
    of youth leaders from across the country have responded to the President's call.
                                                                                                . Hex-Dump Conversion

THE PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE ON ~CE (PIR). The President is leading the nation in an
effort to become One America in the 21 st Century. To achieve this goal, President Clinton
is:

   Developing policy that offers opportunity to all who work for it. From education
    empowennent zones to stepping up enforcement to stop discrimination in housing,
    President Clinton is developing and implementing policies that help all Americans make
    the most of their lives;                                             .

 , Engaging Americans in a broad and constructive dialogue on race. The President is
    encouraging communities across the country to engage in constructive dialogues on race.
    He is calling on them, not only to stand against discrimination, but to build greater
    understanding across racial lines;

   Highlighting Promising Practices that work. In communities throughout the country,
    people are working to bridge racial divides and to create greater opportunity for all. The
    President's Initiative is identifying and creating a compilation of these efforts, named
    "promising practices," so that others may participate in them or replicate them in their
    own communities;

   Recruiting leaders. The President is inviting leaders in all areas of American life to help
    him bring his One America Initiative to all communities;                         .

   Focusing on young Americans. Recognizing that young Americans are the future
    leaders of this nation, President Clinton is making a special effort to actively engage youth
    in his Initiative;

   Working with the PIR Advisory Board. A small, diverse group of individuals,
    recognized for their outstanding leadership on race related issues, is advising and assisting
    the President in outreach efforts and consultations with experts;

   Preparing a report for the nation. The President will issue a report that: 1) presents his
    vision of One America, including an assessment of the growing diversity of our nation; 2)
    reflects the work that has occurred during the Initiative; and 3) provides recommendations
    and solutions that enable individuals, communities, businesses, public and private
    organizations and government at all levels to address difficult issues and build on our best
    possibilities.
                                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
                                           HEALTH CARE

                   "For many Americans, access /0 quality health care can mean the difference between a
         healthy, productive life and the burdens a/illness, worry andfinancial strain. We are taking
         action to give more Americans the security they need. "

                                                                         President Bill Clinton
                                                                         January 6, 1998

A PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS. The nation's health care system is undergoing significant change. Many
Americans worry that these changes lower the quality of care. President Clinton is urging Congress to pass
a Patients' Bill of Rights this year that would provide Americans with much needed protections -- allowing
patients to see the specialists they need; to get emergency care wherever and whenever a medical emergency
arises; to talk freely with doctors and nurses about all the medical option available -- not only the cheapest;
and to appeal when they have grievances about their health.

PROTECTING AMERICA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. Adults ages 55 to 65 are' part of one of the nation's
most vulnerable and difficult to insure populations: they have less access to employer-based health insurance' they are
twice as likely to have health problems; and are at greater risk of losing coverage. The President's targeted Medicare
proposal extends new security to hundreds of thousands of people by offering Americans new opportunities to buy
into Medicare;by providing vulnerable, displaced workers access to Medicare; and by giving Americans whose
companies dropped their commitment to provide retiree health coverage a new option for care.

MEDICARE- STRONGER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN OVER A DECADE. A recent report shows that the Balanced Budget
Act significantly improved the financial future of Medicare. The law's unprecedented reforms extended new
preventive benefits and provided more health choices for Medicare beneficiaries, while cutting the Medicare deficit in
half and extending the life of the Medicare Trust Fund for a decade. President Clinton is now waiting for
recommendations from a bipartisan commission on further steps that can be taken to strengthen Medicare for the next
century.

21sT CENTURY RESEARCH FUND. To promote new breakthroughs, which could revolutionize the way medical
experts understand, treat and prevent serious diseases, the President's budget proposal contains an historic
up-front investment in biomedical research.

ENSURING NEW ADVANCES IN MEDICINE ARE NOT USED To DISCRIMINATE. The President has called for
legislation prohibiting the use of genetic screening to discriminate in health insurance and employment.

ENSURING HEALTH CARE INTO THE 21sT CENTURY. These efforts are an important part of President
Clinton's plan to ensure the health care security of all Americans while containing health care costs for
working families and businesses. It builds on the success of the President's other health care policies:

    Children's Health Initiative: the single largest investment in health care for children since passage of
     Medicaid in 1965, this initiative provides significant health care coverage for up to 5 million uninsured
     children, including support for prescription drugs, vision, hearing and mental health services;

    Medicare Reform: the President's balanced budget plan protects, modernizes and extends the Medicare
     Trust Fund at least a decade while saving up to $450 billion dollars over ten years; the plan also expands
     preventive benefits including additional coverage for mammograms, colorectal screening, and improved
     self management of diseases like diabetes;

    Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Care Bill: by enacting the health care bill, President Clinton helped limits
     exclusions for pre-existing conditions, makes coverage portable and helps individuals who lose jobs maintain
     coverage;

    Childhood Immunizations: Over 90% of America's toddlers in 1996 received the most critical doses of each
     of the routinely recommended vaccines -- surpassing the President's 1993 goal.
                                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

                                        ENVIRONMENT

                   "We come together to celebrate the foresight of early conservationists... We come to
         dedicate ourselves to carrying forth their abiding sense ofstewardship into the new millennium.
         We come to promise that our children will inherit an America whose natural bounty is even
         greater than it is today. "

                                                                       President Bill Clinton
                                                                       April 22, 1998


A CLEAN, SAFE AMERICA. One in four Americans, including 10 million children, live within four
miles of a Superfund hazardous waste site. The Clinton Administration has greatly accelerated
cleanups, completing more than twice as many in the past five years as were completed in the previous
twelve. Now, the President is proposing additional resources to help communities in their fight against
toxics, and he is calling on Congress to stand by the "polluter pays" principle so that polluters, not
taxpayers, bear the cost of cleanup. The President is also asking Congress to pass his Environmental
Crimes bill to strengthen the tools available to Federal, State and local prosecutors to go after illegal
polluters.

CLEAN WATER HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. Forty percent of our surveyed waterways are still too
polluted for fishing and swimming. The largest remaining challenge is reducing "non point"
pollution: runoff from farms, city streets and other sources. President Clinton's Clean Water
Action Plan supports efforts by states and communities to protect and restore our beaches, fish
and drinking water sources.

SAVING AND RESTORING OUR PARKS AND FORESTS. A new agenda for America's 155 national forests
emphasizes recreation, wildlife an'd water quality, while reforming logging practices to assure steady
supplies of timber and jobs. The President's five-year budget proposes a 43% increase for land
acquisitions and would provide a nearly $1 billion increase for priority maintenance and construction
at national parks and other public lands.

LEADING THE FIGHT AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING. U.S. leadership was instrumental in achieving
international agreement in Kyoto, Japan, on strong, realistic targets for greenhouse gas reductions and
flexible market-based mechanisms for achieving them. To promote cost-effective steps to reduce U.S.
emissions, the President is proposing a five-year $6.3 billion package of tax incentives and research and
development to spur energy efficiency and clean energy technologies. Measures include tax breaks for
highly energy-efficient cars and homes, solar rooftop panels, and energy-saving heating and cooling
systems.

PRESERVING OUR NATIONAL TREASURES. As part of the historic balanced budget agreement -- through
the Land and Water Conservation Fund -- 100 new sites can be added to the nation's endowment of sacred
places. These will include, bringing remaining sections of the Appalachian Trail under public control, saving
the ancient redwoods of the Headwaters Forest, and protecting Yellowstone from mining. President Clinton
is calling on Congress to release the funds to protect these treasures.

ENCOURAGING STEWARDSHIP ON AMERICA'S PRIVATE LANDS. President Clinton is forging a new
vision of coriservation, building voluntary partnerships with private landowners to preserve natural wonders
in every community. Of the 140 million acres protected during the past five years, more than three-quarters
are private lands. These innovative collaborations are providing habitat for fish and wildlife, cleaning our
water, and protecting our soil -- while ensuring that people can continue to make a living off their land.
                                                                                        Hex-Dum en'
                                              EDUCATION

                         "Every American who is willing to work and study hard can now afford college...
               We've thrown open the doors to higher learning. Now, we must continue working to make
               sure all our children can walk through them and seize the opportunities of the future.
               That is why in my balanced budget, I am proposing the largest commitment to K-12
               education in history -- a comprehensive plan to raise standards, raise expectations and
               raise accountability in our schools. "

                                                                            President Bill Clinton

BUILDING ON THE LARGEST EDUCATION INVESTMENT IN 30 YEARS. President Clinton has made K-12
education a top priority -- by taking steps to reduce class size, modernize and build new schools, pass national
standards, end the practice of social promotion, and continue education reform. His plan builds on 1998's
budget allocations in higher education -- the largest education investment in 30 years and the largest investment
in higher education since the G.I. Bill in 1945. The President's plan:

   Reduces Class Size. The President's budget includes a $12.4 billion initiative over 7 years to help local
    schools provide small classes with qualified teachers in the early grades. The initiative will reduce class size
    in grades 1-3 to a nationwide average of 18, and will help local school districts hire an additional 100,000
    well-prepared teachers.

   Modernizes and Build Schools to Improve Student Learning. In order for students to learn and compete
    in the global economy, schools must be well-equipped and able to accommodate smaller class sizes. The
    President is proposing federal tax credits to modernize and build more than 5,000 new schools -- half of this
    support will be allocated to the 100 school districts with the largest number of low-income students.

   Achieves High Standards. No child should be allowed to pass to the next grade unless he or she has
    mastered the material. The President's plan includes proposals to ensure that all students attend schools
    where high standards are taken seriously and kids are given the help they need to succeed. It supports the
    continued development and implementation of high national standards and national tests, and establishes
    educational opportunity zones in poor urban and rural communities to give students the tools and
    opportunities needed for success. It also provides schools with guidelines on how to end social promotion,
    ensure that more students learn what they need the first time round, and help those who don't with extra
    tutoring and summer school.

   Expands Access to Safe After-School Care. To help create safe, positive learning environments for
    American school-age children who lack adult supervision during a typical week, the President is proposing to
    increase the 21 st Century Learning Center Program by $800 million over five years to support
    school-community partnerships that expand or establish programs providing after-school care for up to half a
    million children a year.

   Optimizes Educational Technology. The President's plan provides new or expanded initiatives to ensure
    that all children have access to the "information superhighway" and to broaden access to high quality
    learning opportunities for adults using the Internet and other new technologies.

   Inspires Young People. The President's plan includes a new" High Hopes" initiative to inspire young
    people to have high expectations of themselves, to study hard, and to go to college. The initiative
    promotes partnerships between colleges and middle or junior high schools in low-income communities
    to help teach students how they can go to college by informing them about college options, academic
    requirements, costs, and fmancial aid, and by providing support services -- including tutoring, counseling,
    and mentoring.

               spirit of the American people. And it is also the fruit of the comprehensive economic
               strategy we put in place in 1993 -- an economic strategy for the Information Age."

     THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN A GENERATION. President Clinton's three-part economic
     strategy -- balancing the budget, investing in our people, opening new markets to American
     goods and services -- is working for America's families. Since 19~3 it has helped bring about:

           Strong economic growth. In the first quarter of 1998, the economy grew at a strong

            percent;

           The first investment-led expansion in three decades. In the first quarter of 1998,
            investment in business equipment rose 28.8 percent at an annual rate. For the first time
            on record, business investment has grown at double-digit rates for five years in a row;

           The first balanced budget in a generation. The President's FY99 budget will be the
            first balanced budget in a generation, after inheriting a record $290 billion deficit in 1992.

            manufacturing and construction combined;

           An increase in family income of nearly $2,200. Real wages are rising at their fastest

            adjusted for inflation;

           The highest home ownership rate in history. Under President Clinton the home
            ownership rate reached an historic high of 66 percent. As a result, 67 million
            Americans own their homes -- nearly six million more than when Clinton came to
            office.

            consumer confidence rose to is highest quarterly level since 1969.

                          1998 ADMINISTRATION THEMES


             THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS A CONCRETE PLAN OF ACTION
                   THAT IDENTIFIES OUR PRIORITIES AND APPROACHES TO KEY ISSUES

    We have a unique moment in time to prepare America for the 21st Century. Under President
    Clinton's leadership, America has achieved an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity:
                   -    the strongest economy in a generation;
                   --   the first balanced budget in a generation;
                   --   crime rates at their lowest levels in 24 years;
                   --   nearly 15 million new jobs since 1993;
                   --   unemployment at its lowest level in more than a quarter century;
                   --   deficit cut by more than 90 percent;
                   --   unrivaled world leadership.

    This is an opportunity for action. President Clinton is challenging us to use this unique moment in
    time as an opportunity to prepare for the next century. It builds on the new kind of government
    President Clinton is creating - a leaner, more flexible government. One that does not try to do
    everything. One that gives Americans the tools and conditions needed to make the most of their
    own lives.

    At the center of President Clinton's vision for a stronger America are three goals:
           an economy that honors opportunity;
           a society rooted in responsibility;
           and, a nation that lives as a community.

                   HERE IS HOW THESE GOALS FIT INTO PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISION OF
                             A STRONGER AMERICA IN THE 21ST CENTURY:

    Opportunity: a new economy full of potential. The President's plan for building a more
    prosperous America consists of three central strategies:

          Fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth. President Clinton submitted the first
           balanced budget in thirty years. The President's balanced budget includes new, fiscally
           responsible tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for education, for child care,
           and for the environment. The President is calling for the projected budget surpluses to be
           reserved pending Social Security reform.

          Investing in our people to prepare them for the new economy. We must give Americans the
           tools and opportunities they need to make the most of their lives. Last year the President
           made education the nation's highest priority - making college as universal as high school is
           today. This year, the President will ask us to make our public elementary and secondary
           schools the best in the world - by raising standards, raising expectations and raising
           accountability.

          Tearing down trade barriers to open new markets for American products and workers. In
           an increasingly interdependent world, our prosperity depends on our ability to freely trade
           and interact with all the markets in the world. The President's plan renews his request for
           negotiating authority and reaffirms our commitment to helping nations that are
           undertaking serious efforts to put their economic houses in order.
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

Responsibility: creating a society that acts responsibly. The President's plan helps us act
responsibly, both as a nation and as individuals:

      It calls for action to promote the value of work, not welfare. From increasing child support
       collections to helping families move closer to available jobs and creating more
       welfare-to-work partnerships, the President challenges America to end a system that has
       trapped generation in a cycle of dependency.

      It calls for action to help working families deal with the challenges of the next generation.
       From helping provide working Americans with safe, affordable child care to improving the
       quality and accessibility of health care; froni ensuring Medicare and Social Security for our
       children to protecting our youth from tobacco. We are working to give hard-working
       American families the tools they need to meet their most important responsibilities, at home
       and at work.

      It holds individuals responsible when they break the law. With murder, robbery, assault
       and burglary down all across the nation, President Clinton is calling for a special focus on
       addressing juvenile crime - providing more resources to crack down on gangs, guns and
       drugs. His strategy holds criminals responsible and punishes crime severely when it occurs,
       and more important, it prevents crime from happening in the first place.

      It ensures our commitment to world leadership for peace, freedom and prosperity. The
       President Clinton is committed to keeping America strong, by maintaining our role as the
       world's indispensable nation. This includes building an undivided, peaceful Europe;
       forging an Asia Pacific community; prospering in the global economy; remaining a force for
       peace and freedom; moving strongly against new security threats; and maintaining the
       resources to meet these challenges.

Community: strengthening our communities. The President's plan helps strengthen America's
communities for the 21st century:

      It invests in our cities, giving them tools and opportunities they need to continue an urban
       renaissance. The best poverty program, the best jobs program, the best community
       development program is a growing economy. The President's plan helps America's
       communities grow by bringing private enterprise into the inner city, through empowerment
       zones, community development banks, more loans from commercial banks, and tax
       incentives to develop affordable, low-income housing.

      It protects the environment, ensuring a cleaner, healthier planet for our children. Through
       tax cuts and research and development in emerging technologies, the President's plan finds
       a way to grow the economy and clean the environment at the same time.

      It helps us remain strong One America, creating a more just and fair society that does not
       focus on our differences, but underscores our Shared strengths. The President has issued a
       strong call for unity - emphasizing that our diversity is our greatest strength as we move
       into the 21st Century.
