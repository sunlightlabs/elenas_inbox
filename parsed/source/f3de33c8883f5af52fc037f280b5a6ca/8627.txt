           SENATE REPUBLICAN PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS PROPOSAL IS CLOSER TO AN
                INSURERS' BILL OF RIGHTS THAN A PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS
                                       July 15, 1998      Automated Records Management System
                                                                                          Hex.[)ump Conversion
      After nine months of ignoring the President's call for a strong enforceable, bipartisan patients' bill of rights,
      the Senate Republicans have responded with a rhetoric-laced, partisan proposal that places the interests of
      insurers above the needs of patients. The proposal, for which their continues to be no legislative language,
      falls far short of what patients need to ensure that their health plans provide patients with basic health care
      needs. The fact that Republicans have yet to introduce a bill with less than 40 days left in this Congress
      raises serious questions as to whether they are truly committed to passing a bill of rights or selling a
      bill of goods American public. The Republican proposal falls short in many areas. For example, it:

            Does not provide the majority of Americans all of the patient protections they need. The
             Republican proposal, however inadequate, only applies to Americans in self-insured plans and
             excludes the majority of Americans. Therefore, those tens of million of Americans excluded from
             these protections would only have the rights they need if every state passed every protection into law.

                     States patients rights laws do not provide the protections patients need. No state has
                     passed all of the protections in the patients' bill of rights, and most states have passed only a
                     few or none of the protections. For example, as many as twenty states have not passed
                     protections that assure patients access to the specialists they need.

                     Unfair to Americans in small businesses. Most Americans who work in small businesses
                     would not be protected by the Senate Republican proposal. The plan explicitly excludes
                     these Americans from these protections and holds them hostage to the hope that every state
                     will some day pass these protections.

                     Inconsistent with the bipartisan Kassebaum-Kennedy law. Rejects bipartisan
                     Kassebaum-Kennedy approach that guarantees insurance protections are extended to all
                     Americans. There is no reason the patients' bill of rights should not follow this same
                     structure.

            Does not guarantee access to specialists. Assuring access to needed specialists is an absolutely
             essential protection. We have heard again and again about patients who could not see
             oncologists or specialists to treat heart conditions or diabetes. The Senate Republicans do not
             assure that patients with critical health needs have access to the specialists they need.

            Does not limit or require disclosure of financial incentives for doctors. Patients should not be
             put at risk through unknown destructive financial incentives to limit patient care. The Senate
             Republican proposal explicitly does not provide patients this important protection.

            Doe not compensate patients who are maimed or who die as a result of a wrongful health plan
             action. A right without a remedy is simply not a right. The Senate Republican proposal does
             not have any recourse for patients who are maimed or injured by their health plans. Because it
             has no enforcement provision, plans who ignore the patient protections will not be held
             accountable. Moreover, this provision is even weaker than the House Republican proposal.

      The President Remains Committed to Passing a Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights in This
      Congress. Notwithstanding his concerns, he will work to pass a strong enforceable patients' bill of rights

     TEXT:
     Attached for your OK is a draft press statement on the signing of the
     child support incentives bill.  phil Caplan wants this tonight so he can
     circulate it in the West Wing for clearance. He expects the President to
     sign the bill tomorrow.

     FYI, Melissa feels that we shouldn't criticize the old nuclear penalty
     because it risks making the bill look weak.  She feels we should simply
     say that these are "additional tough penalties" since HHS could still
     theoretically use the nuclear penalty. This draft reflects her views.

     DRAFT

     PresidentD,s Statement on Signing of HR3130 (to be released to press)

     I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 3130, the Child Support Performance and
     Incentive Act. This Administration has conducted an unprecedented
     campaign to increase parental responsibility and ensure that parents
     support their children. We have had many successes. Through tougher
     enforcement, we have collected a record $13.4 billion in child support, an
     increase of 68% since 1992, with 1.4 million more families now receiving
     child support.   In addition, we located one million delinquent parents
     during the first nine months of a new collection system that tracks
     parents across state lines, a system enacted as part of the 1996 welfare
     law that my Administration first proposed in 1994. On paternity
     establishment, which is often the crucial first step in child support
     cases, we set a record in 1997 -- 1.3 million paternities established, or
     two and a half times as many as in 1992. Last month, I signed the
     Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, a law based on my AdministrationD,s 1996
     proposal to crack down on egregious child support evaders by creating a
     new felony offense for those who flee across state lines to avoid
     supporting their children.

     However, there is much more that we must do. H.R. 3130 will build on this
     progress and help ensure that parents give their children all the support
     they need and deserve.

     First, the new law incorporates a proposal that my Administration sent to
     Congress last year.  It will reward states for their performance on a
     wider range of key child support goals, such as the number of paternity
"

    establishments and child support orders, rather than simply on
    cost-effectiveness as the old law provided,

    Second, it puts in place additional tough penalties for states that fail
    to automate their child support computer systems on time. Under this new
    law, states that fail to establish these state-wide systems face automatic
    and escalating penalties, ranging from 4% of funds for the first year to
    30% for the fifth year that a state fails to implement a system,

Third, the new law will make it easier for states to establish
standardized medical support orders in cases where the non-custodial
parent has private health insurance, by putting in place a process to
create a medical support notice that all companies will recognize.

Many members of Congress, Administration officials, state officials,
experts, and childrenD,s advocates worked together constructively in a
bipartisan fashion to craft this valuable piece of legislation, and I wish
to thank them for their efforts,  In particular, I would like to thank
Reps,
Levin and Shaw, and Senators Moynihan, Roth, Rockefeller, and Baucus. [Leg
