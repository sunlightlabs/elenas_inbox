Per Bruce's request, we sent these to HHS for Shalala to use on member
calls tomorrow morning.  They are exactly the same as the press Q&As we
did yesterday, just in a different format and with an added background
that Gramm may scale his proposal back somewhat.

                          Talking Points on the Granun Amendment

Background information:

The Gramm amendment, as offered, would cost approximately $46 billion over 5 years. It
would provide a tax deduction of$3,450 to married couples filing a joint return with incomes
below $50,000. Because couples in this income range are in the 15 percent tax bracket, the
deduction would be worth about $518 per year. It is billed as an amendment to eliminate the
marriage penalty, but it actually provides an across-the-board tax cut to all married couples with
incomes under $50,000, regardless of whether they actually experience a marriage penalty under
the tax code.

Due to some members' concerns over the high price tag of this amendment, Gramm has raised
the possibility of scaling back his amendment so that it would cost in the area of $17 billion over
the first 5 years, and $38 billion over the second 5 years. This is still in flux.

Talking Points:

       I strongly urge you to vote against the Gramm amendment because it would prevent the
        legislation from achieving important health goals. The McCain Manager's amendment
        contains $59 billion over 5 years for health research and public health programs,
        assistance to farmers and their communities, and the states. Under the Gramm
        amendment, $46 billion would go to tax cuts, reducing the funding available for these
        other important purposes by 78 percent.

       The Gramm amendment would eviscerate funding for critical public health programs
        such as smoking cessation, education and counteradvertising. This would significantly
        undermine efforts to reduce youth smoking in this country and help adults who want to
        quit. Critical funding for medical research would also be cut drastically, including
        research into smoking-related diseases such as cancer and heart disease.

       The amendment would also leave very little funding available for the states. States
        would be expected to forgo their claims in court and receive, in exchange, only minimal
        compensation for their enormous expenditures related to smoking-related illnesses.

       Finally, the amendment would leave almost nothing left over for tobacco farmers, who
        have done nothing wrong and who deserve to be compensated for the losses they will
        suffer as a result of tobacco legislation.

    If asked whether the President would consider a less costly effort to lessen the marriage penalty:

               Our priority is to ensure adequate funding for public health programs to reduce youth
                smoking and health research to cure tobacco-related diseases, while also providing states
                and tobacco farmers with the compensation they deserve.

               The President will not jeopardize his youth smoking goals by supporting irresponsible tax
                cuts in the context of this legislation. If someone proposes a targeted and reasonable
                sized tax proposal that does not interfere with these goals, the Administration will review
                it. But so far, we have not seen any such proposals; the tax cuts being talked about now
                are cuts that will severely undermine the core purposes of this legislation.
