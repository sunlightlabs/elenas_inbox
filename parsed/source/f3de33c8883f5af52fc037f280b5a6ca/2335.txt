                           Questions and Answers
                               May 21,1997


Methamphetamine Report

Q.   What does today's report say?

A.   Today's report provides an update of the Administration's National Methamphetamine
     Strategy and make two key findings: (1) that methamphetamine use is down in 8 key
     cities; and (2) that clandestine lab seizures by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) are
     up 170% in 1996. The Justice Department report cites 1996 data which shows that in
     eight western cities --Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, Portland, San
     Diego, and San Jose-- methamphetamine use declined between 7 and 52% from 1995
     levels.

     Moreover, the report shows that our strategy is being aggressively implemented and
     showing results. We've worked with Congress to strengthen penalties for meth
     trafficking and established new controls over precursor chemicals used to manufacture
     meth. U.S. Attorneys -- working with coalitions of federal, state and local law
     enforcement agencies -- are successfully prosecuting methamphetamine, including
     lifetime sentences for certain convicted methamphetamine traffickers. Federal agencies
     are working to increase information about the dangers ofmeth. They're producing
     meth-specific education and prevention materials, hosting local conferences and training
     local law enforcement.

Q.   What is methamphetamine? Why is it so dangerous?

A.   Methamphetamine is a synthetic stimulant drug that creates extreme aggressiveness
     among chronic users. The violence-prone, irrational, and aggressive behavior associated
     with methamphetamine usage make it an especially volatile drug. Meth can be snorted,
     smoked, injected, or ingested orally. The effects of methamphetamine can last anywhere
     from 4 to 24 hours, while the effect of cocaine is measured in minutes. The crash that
     occurs with the tapering off of methamphetamine's effects is often potentially
     psychologically disastrous.

     Additionally, clandestine laboratories that manufacture methamphetamine pose an
     environmental and safety hazard, as toxic wastes are frequently dumped on the ground or
     into waterways, as well as the enormously high risk of a fire or explosion. Anyone near
     a meth manufacturing lab is in potential danger, and cleanup costs, per lab, run into
     thousands of dollars.
Q.   How much does methamphetamine cost?

                                             1

                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
     cocaine costs about $100. For this reason, meth is often referred to as the "poor man's
     cocaine."

Q.   How serious is the methamphetamine problem?

A.   The methamphetamine problem is serious and spreading. In recent years, use of the drug
     has spread from the West to the Midwest. As a result, meth-related emergency room
     episodes doubled between 1991 and 1994, and the number of meth-related deaths tripled.
      Seizures of clandestine laboratories and along the Southwest border also increased
     during this time period.

     More importantly, methamphetamine is a triple killer and extremely dangerous: First, it is
     a cheap, highly addictive, long-lasting stimulant that often induces violent behavior;
     Second, labs used to manufacture meth present a high risk of fire or explosion,
     endangering nearby residents; and third, the toxic wastes produced by meth labs are often
     dumped on the ground and in waterways, posing an environmental threat to entire
     communities.

Q.   Why are you only providing meth data for 9 cities? Is there data on other cities?

A.   The Drug Use Forecasting System collects meth data for 23 cities across the country.
     The methamphetamine use amongst the arrestees tested in the other 14 cities was so low,
     it was determined to be insignificant. By insignificant, we mean less than one percent.

Q.   Doesn't the drop in the numbers for methamphetamine mean that we're just
     generating hysteria about methamphetamine when the problem is really
     disappearing? .

A.   Not at all. I am very encouraged by the new, lower numbers. But we are just turning the
     comer. Now is not the time to let up. The numbers show that when we work hard, we
     can have some effect. Now, we've got to redouble that effort and help to prevent the
     spread of this dangerous drug to the eastern part of the U.S.

Q.   If illegal drugs are such a big problem, then why didn't your new anti-gang bill
     contain new drug provisions?

A.   Our juvenile crime bill does contain increased penalties for people who sell drugs to kids
     and use kids to sell drugs. But we should keep in mind that existing federal drug laws
     are already pretty tough. Trafficking can carry up to a life sentence.

     But we also need to do is to make sure that local prosecutors have more resources to go

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

     Additionally, our anti-gang strategy calls fix expanding after school programs. This will
     not only help us cut crimes when kids would be otherwise unsupervised, it will help
     schools get the message out that gangs, guns and drugs are dangerous.

Q.   Mr. President, despite the 1994 Crime Act and tough drug laws, federal statistics
     show enormous increases in drug use among teenagers. Don't these figures show
     that you have failed and that you are taking the wrong approach?

A.   I am deeply disturbed by the current trends in teenage drug use. General McCaffrey, the
     Attorney General and I have spent a great deal of time on this issue. That's why I've
     proposed a national media campaign, leveraged with private sector resources, to reach the
     68 million kids at risk in this country.

     That's also why we need more programs to stop crimes and drug use from happening in
     the first place. We need a place for young people to go in those hours after school when
     they are unsupervised. If we don't, they may just wind up on a street corner using drugs
     or getting involved in delinquent or criminal activity. I've asked Congress to provide
     funds for aller-school programs and for programs for at -risk youths-- so we could keep
     kids otlthe streets and out of trouble. I was disappointed that the House didn't include
     these provisions in its juvenile crime bill, but I'm hopeful that we'll be successful in the
     Senate.

Money Laundering

Q:   Could you briefly describe the proposed regulations on money laundering?

A:   When I learned of the successes of the New York Geographic Targeting Order «(iTO) in
     dramatically reducing the !low of narcotics proceeds to Columbia, I asked the Treasury
     Department to examine ways to extend the GTO nationally.

     Today's regulations are a response to my request. There are three proposed rules which
     will be published today. The most ti.mdamental of these proposals is to register "money
     services businesses" generally, which includes money transmitters or remitter, money
     order issuers and sellers, travelers check issLlers and sellers, retail currency exchanges,
     and check cashers.

     The second proposed regulation would extend the suspicioLls activity reporting
     requirements-~ already in place with respect to banks -- to money transmitters and
     issuers, sellers and redeemers of traveler's checks or money orders.

     The linal prop()sed regulation essentially makes the New York OTO apply nation-wide



                                                                                            ,"~ .A···':~'·:ntSF·~,:m
                                                                     i' 1e:;!.:··;,.... J     ~',C:'i'.,2.SjJ;1
     to report currency transactions of $750 or more that involve the transmission of funds to
     any person outside of the United States. The rule also requires the remitters to verify the
     identity of the person sending the funds.

Q:   When will these proposed regulations become effective?

A:   There will be a 90-day comment period that begins today. We will then review the
     comments and make any appropriate changes to the rules. Once that is complete, we will
     publish the final rule. We hope to do this by January 1, 1998.

     The rules regarding suspicious activity reporting and the new $750 reporting threshold
     will take effect 30 days after the final rule~ are published. Money services businesses will
     have 180 days from publication of the final rules to register with FinCEN.

Q:   What are the current reporting requirements for sending money transmissions
     outside the U.S.?

A:   Currently, no record has to be kept for any transmission under $3,000. For transmissions
     of$3,000 or more, the money transmitter must keep a record of the transmission. For
     transmissions of $1 0,000 or more, the money transmitter must fill out a Currency
     Transaction Report or CTR and file it with the IRS.

Q:   Why the $750 threshold?

A:   Our experience with the El Dorado Task Force indicates that most legitimate money
     transmissions are between $250 and $500, and that most of the abuse by money
     launderers occurs above this level. Thus, we made the threshold $750 so as to exclude
     the majority of legitimate businesses from reporting requirements.

Q:   Money transmitters are used primarily by people who do not have bank
            accounts -the poor and immigrants. Isn't it then discriminatory to have a
     $750 threshold for transmitters and not banks?

A:   We do not believe the proposed regulations are discriminatory. The $750 amount applies
     to wires purchased in cash that are sent anyWhere outside the United States. We did not
     focus on any particular country or region.

     Also, these regulations do not prevent anyone from wiring money anywhere. You can pay
     cash to send $100,000 to Colombia tomorrow, so long as you fill out a form and provide
     a photo !D. The proposed rules are designed to stop the abuse of the money transmitter
     industry by criminals by collecting information, not to prevent legitimate transactions.

GENERAL DRUG POLICY OUESTIONS

Q.   Why do you think spending $175 million on an ad campaign will reduce drug use
     among our youth?

A.   The central challenge we face is to reverse the surge in youth drug rates-- this is the focus
     of my 1997 National Drug Control Strategy and it is the primary concern of the mayors.
     My targeted anti-drug advertising campaign-- which would involve about I percent of the
     federal counterdrug budget-- holds the promise to change our youth's relaxed attitudes
     toward drugs. We have 68 million kids who are vulnerable to drugs. It is imperative
     that we get our kids accurate information about drugs.

Q.   What do you think of the Sentencing Commission's recommendations on penalties
     for crack and powder cocaine?

A.   Last month, I commended the Sentencing Commission for moving forward with
     recommendations to Congress to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine
     penalties. My Administration will give them very serious consideration. I have asked
     Attorney General Reno and General McCaffrey to review the Sentencing Commission's
     recommendations and report back to me by the end of June.

     However, I continue to believe that our sentencing laws must reflect that crack cocaine is
     a more harmful form of cocaine. The Sentencing Commission's new recommendations
     do so. Trafficking in crack, and the violence it fosters, has a devastating impact on
     communities across America, and any changes in penalties must ensure that more
     dangerous offenders receive tougher sentences.

Q.   Isn't the National Action Plan put forward by the Mayors essentially a criticism of
     your Administration's drug policy? Doesn't it call for more funds and different
     actions to be taken?

A.   I don't think so. On the contrary, I think the Mayors' Action Plan is complementary to
     our own National Drug Strategy. Both of our plans share the same number one priority:
     that drug use amongst our kids must be reduced. Both of our plans call for a
     comprehensive drug strategy that includes enforcement, treatment, prevention and
     education. And both of our plans recognize the importance of responding to the
     country's growing methamphetamine problem -- as well as cracking down on money
     laundering. While some of the details vary, are plans are largely similar.
