                          DRAFT -- May 13, 1997

For over 20 years, the IDEA has guaranteed a free, appropriate public education to
students with disabilities; IDEA currently assists over 5.7 million students across the U.S.
to reach their full potential. IDEA has gready decreased the number of children in institutions
and has signilicandy increased the number ofyoung adults with disabilities going on to higher
education and employment. The reauthorization legislation approved by the House and Senate
today, with the strong support of the President, strengthens and reaffirms our Nation's
commitment to disabled children and their parents.

The new legislation upgrades the IDEA in several ways:

      A stronger emphasis on educational results. The new IDEA revises the content of student
       Individual Education Plans to better focus on enabling disabled children to participate and
       progress in the general curriculum. In addition, the new law reaffirms that all children
       with disabilities must be included in State and district assessments, with appropriate
       accommodations where necessary.

      Better support for parents. Under the new IDEA, Parents will be more fully involved in
       student placement decisions. Moreover, the new law requires that parents receive report
       cards on the progress of their children as frequently as parents of non-disabled children.

      Protecting the safety of all students in the classroom while retaining the essential rights
       and protections of disabled students. As proposed by the Administration, the new IDEA
       expands the 'authority of school officials to remove a child for up to 45 days for
       misconduct involving weapons or illegal drugs. The new law gives hearing officers the
       authority now reserved to courts to remove a child whose continued presence would pose
       a substantial risk of injury to the child or others. However, the reauthorization overrides
       a recent 4th Circuit decision on cessation of services, making clear that educational
       services may not be terminated for any child with a disability.

      Reduced costs, paperwork, and litigation. The new IDEA gives school districts financial
       relief through new cost-sharing provisions, and reduces paperwork for teachers, school
       districts and States. In addition, parents and school authorities will be able to resolve
       disputes through new mediation mechanisms.

      Improved funding formula. As proposed by the Administration, the reauthorization
       makes changes in the IDEA funding fonnula to diminish incentives to wrongly identify
       children as having a disability, although these changes would only take effect in future
       years as appropriations reach higher levels.

The new legislation is the product of a consensus-building process involving congressional

and disability communities, and shows how bipartisan cooperation can help achieve important
national goals.

            Talking Points on the IDEA Reauthorization - DRAFT May 12, 1997


      The IDEA reauthorization bill that is likely to pass today, with the full support of the
       President, will strengthen and reaffirm our Nation's 20-year old commitment to disabled
       children and their parents.

      The new law reflects many of the key principles outlined in the Administration's
       reauthorization proposal. The upgraded IDEA contains a stronger emphasis on
       educational results and provides better support for parents. The reauthorization also
       protects the safety of all students in the classroom while retaining the essential rights and
       protections of disabled students. In addition, the new IDEA has a modified funding
       formula to reduce incentives to wrongly identify children as having a disability.

      IDEA legislation died a contentious death at the end of the last Congress, but
       today's vote shows what is possible when Democrats and Republicans put aside
       their differences and work to achieve important national goals. We hope to
       continue in this bipartisan spirit and move forward on the rest of our agenda to improve
       education and prepare America for the 21st Century.

DRAFT -- May 13, 1997

Q:      Do you think Majority Leader Lott and his staff deserve the credit for passing this
legislation this time?

A:      The Majority Leader and his chief of staff, David Hoppe, showed considerable leadership
throughout this process, but this accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard
work of a number of Democrats and Republicans from both the House and the Senate, and by
Secretary Riley and the Administration negotiating team, led by Assistant Secretary Judy
Heumann ("HUMAN"). This group worked very closely with education groups and the
disability community to get a consensus bill.

Q:      What effect does this legislation have on Virginia's dispute with the Administration over
services to disabled students who have been suspended or expelled?

A:.      The new IDEA has important provisions that protect the safety of all students in the
classroom while retaining the essential rights and protections of disabled students. For example,
the new law expands the authority of school officials to remove a child from the classroom for
misconduct involving weapons or illegal drugs, and gives hearing officers authority (previously
reserved to courts) to remove a child whose continued presence would pose a substantial risk of
injury. With respect to Virginia, the reauthorization adopts the Administration's position,
overriding a recent 4th Circuit decision and making clear that educational services may not be
terminated for any child with a disability.

Q:      Pete Wilson and others have criticized this bill because it still requires that long-term
inmates get services, taking funds away from other students. Should Congress have prohibited
services to this population?

A:       In a compromise톝upported by California Republican Congressman Frank Riggs, the new
IDEA strikes a reasonable balance on the issue of serving disabled youth in adult correctional
facilities, allowing the Governor to transfer responsibility for these services to the State
correctional agency and relieving the State from certain requirements of the law.

Q:     Is this legislation supported by education groups and the disability community?

A:      While nearly all groups involved in the negotiating process had to give up something to
reach consensus, the new law has remarkably broad support among both education groups and
disability rights advocates.

Q:     How much does the Federal government spend on special education?

A:     For FY 97, appropriations for State grants under IDEA (parts B and H) total $3.78 billion,
up from $3 billion in FY 96. The Administration has proposed increasing state grants by an
additional 4.3%, to a total of $3.95 billion, for FY 98.

A:      IDEA is not an unfunded mandate. No state has to participate in IDEA; participation is
voluntary, and assists states to meet their constitutional obligations to provide equal access to a
public education to children with disabilities. States would have these obligations even if they
did not receive IDEA funds. Moreover, IDEA is exemptedfrom coverage by the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 signed by the President.

Q:     Does the Administration agree with Senator Gregg that the share of IDEA funding should
increase to 40% of total costs?

A:     The Administration agrees with Senator Gregg that the federal government should
contribute more toward meeting the costs of special education, and has consistently sought
increases in funding for this program. However, it is important to support a broad range of
programs which will improve educational opportunities for all Americans.

    STATEMENT ON HOUSE AND SENATE PASSAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH
    DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT (IDEA) REAUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION --
    DRAFT -- May 13, 1997

    I am pleased that the House and Senate today took a major step toward ensuring high
    quality educational opportunities for students with disabilities by voting to reauthorize the
    IDEA. Over the last 20 years, the IDEA has made it possible for mjjjjons ofyoung people
    with disabilities to reach their full potential, and this legislation strengthens and reaffirms our
    commitment to these children and their parents. This legislation is the result of a remarkable
    process involving hard work by congressional Democrats and Republicans, the Department of
    Education, and representatives of the education and disability communities. I look forward to
    signing this legislation into law, and I hope that we can continue in this bipartisan spirit and
    move forward on the rest of our agenda to improve education and prepare America for the 21st
    Century.
