     (town hall meetings, web site, etc).
    Distribute literature reflecting these core themes through the commission to schools and
     businesses that reflect this theme.

GOAL TWO: Raise the profile of racial reconciliation and understanding to a degree matched
only in times of trouble and sustain public interest.

ACTIONS:
    Introduce the initiative in a major Presidential address.

     public service announcments and pa.

GOAL THREE: Confront and work to eliminate stereotypes and discrimination.

ACTIONS:
    Survey local and community groups for ideas on best practices involving these issues.
    Serve as a clearing house to distribute best practices to a wider range of community and
     govemmental bodies (e.g. ministerial groups, U.S. Conference on Mayors, National
     League of Cities and National Governors Association)
    Highlight, analyze and develop strategies for overcoming common stereotypes and
     discriminatory acts through town hall meetings, public hearings and report.
    Provide recommendations for actions to eliminate certain discriminatory acts.

     town hall meetings, public hearings, Presidential speeches, PSAs and other means.

       efforts and encourage others to join.                                   .

GOAL FOUR: Initiate and sustain ongoing constructive dialogue on racial issues between the
races and among races, which includes particular attention on how to maintain civil discourse on
some of these divisive issues. Foster the spread of organizations which will further provide
other meaningful interracial dialogue expansion.

     and National Governors Association).

GOAL FIVE: Deliver an accurate analysis of the progress we have achieved, our present
condition and the challenges ahead for the American public

    Undertake original research which analyzes the present state of race and race relations in
     the U.S. from town hall meetings, hearings,
    Study the changing demographics of the U.S. over the next fifty-two years.

GOAL SIX: Provide a more accurate picture to the American people of themselves and of
people different from themselves so that they begin to understand how race affects their
perception of many things, and with that understanding, better respect the views of people of
different races.

      Highlight common perceptions held by certain groups about themselves and others at
       town hall meetings and public hearings.
      Deliver insightful accurate information that addresses those perceptions.
      Analyze how these perceptions are created and recommend effective ways for dealing
       with them.
                                             Hex-Dump ConveT쬦fI.

this country's dynamic racial composition.

ACTIONS:

     include the President speaking to the issue, the results of the report, footage of town hall
     meetings and other meetings, brief shots of commissioners and "real people."
                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

Build a new consensus for this iniative locally and nationally that allows us to implement the
commission's recommendations.
-- from school curricula to improvements in the workplace, to modifications in the criminal
justice system --

In fulfilling the iniative's mission, this effort should focus on a few areas that are vital to
delivering the promise of America to all Americans: the right to a free and quality education,
employment, housing, criminal justice, melting pot tensions, youth, economic issues, violence
and global economic leadership.
