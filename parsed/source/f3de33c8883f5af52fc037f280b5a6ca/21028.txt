4th Circuit Decision -- Background:

FDA Rule: Asserting its authority over tobacco products, the FDA in June 1996 issued
regulations which prohibited the sale of tobacco products to minors. Specifically, the Rule
establishes:

       I) Youth Access Restrictions
              Sets minimum age of purchase at 18 years
              Requires age verification by photo ID for anyone 26 or younger
             Requires face-to-face sales (except for mail order sales)
              Bans vending machines and self-service displays except in facilities where only
               adults are permitted
       2) Advertising Restrictions
             Bans outdoor advertising within 1000 feet of schools and public playgrounds
             Restricts advertising to black-and-white text only (publications, outdoor, point of
              purchase, direct mail, etc.), except in publications with a predominant adult
              readership or at adult only facilities
      .      Prohibits sale or giveaways of products like caps or gym bags that carry cigarette
              or smokeless tobacco product brand !lames or logos
             Prohibits brand-name sponsorship of sporting or entertainment events, but permi ts
              it in the corporate name
       3) Point of Purchase Restrictions
             Prohibits sales of single cigarettes or "Ioosies"
             Bans free samples
             Sets minimum package size at 20 cigarettes
             Restricts all point of purchase advertising and labeling to black-and-white text
              only, except in adult only facilities

District Court: In April 1997, responding to the tobacco industry'S challenge to the 1996 FDA
rule, the US District Court for the Middle District of North Caroline upheld the FDA's
jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. The Judge also upheld the 1996 Rule's age and access
restrictions, as well as the labeling requirements. However, the court said that the FDA did not
have the authority to regulate the advertising and promotion of tobacco products.

Pending appeal, the court delayed implementation of those provisions of the FDA rule which had
not yet gone into effect. Thus, only the age restriction and photo ID check requirement
remained in effect; the court enjoined implementation of all of the other provisions pending
further action by the court (i.e., the youth access restrictions other than age and photo ID checks,
labeling and point of purchase restrictions).

4th Circuit Appeal: Immediately following the District Court decision, both the Federal
government and the tobacco industry filed an appeal. The government appealed the District
Court's decision that FDA lacked authority to regulate the promotion and advertising of tobacco
products, as well as the Court's decision to enjoin certain provisions of the FDA rule. The
industry appealed the Court's decision to affirm FDA authority.
