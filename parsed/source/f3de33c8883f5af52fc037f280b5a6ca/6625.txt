HOT ISSUES IN SENATOR HOLLINGS' DISTRICT

FCC Rulemaking on free television for federal candidates
Next week Senators McCain (R-AZ) and Burns (R-MT) are expected to propose an amendment
to the pending supplemental appropriations bill that would prohibi! the' FCC from promulgating
rules that will require television and radio broadcasters to provide free broadcast time to federal
candidates. Senator Hollings, who is the ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee and
who is a ~enior member of the Appropriations Committee, will playa key role in the success or
failure of the McCain/Burns initiative. The Office of Legislative Affairs has asked him to
oppose the initiative because it would kill a very real opportunity for implementing this key
element of campaign finance reform. To date, Senator Hollings has been noncommittal.

        NOTE: At the event, The Office of Policy Development requests that YOU
        encourage and secure Hollings support for YOUR request to the FCC and ask him
        not to support the amendment by Senator Burns to prohibit the FCC from
        launching rulemaking or inquiry on free television.

You should be aware that Senator Hollings is unhappy with the FCC for a variety of reasons,
including the FCC implementation of the Snowe-Rockerfeller amendment to the 1996
Telecommunications Act which extended universal support for schools, libraries, and rural
hospitals to connect them to the Internet. YOU should also be aware that the Vice President's
Office and Commerce are working with the Senator's staff regarding his concerns.

  Wiring for Schools and Libraries
  The Telecommunications Act established a program whereby telecommunication companies
  fund the wiring of schools and libraries. Some of the providers feel the FCC has mishandled the
. matter and that it has resulted in a new line-item charge on their phone bills. Hollings fears that
  this could become an issue in his campaign as some might call it a "Hollings-Gore tax."

Competition for local telephone service markets
Bell South submitted their application to the FCC last year to provide long distance telephone
service to consumers locally in South Carolina. Bell South used South Carolina as their
"test"model to demonstrate to the FCC that their monopoly on local phone service has ended and
no longer exists, and would thereby welcome local competition. The FCC rejected Bell South's
application last December citing that Bell South had not adequately proved that local markets
were open to the competitors for business. The long distance competition, such as Sprint and
AT&T, are also opposed to this application citing that Bell South's markets are still not
adequately open for local phone service competition.

Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and talking points
Senator Hollings has historically taken a conservative approach to arms control. He is perhaps
the only Democrat we might lose on CTBT.
        Talking points:
         One of my top foreign policy priorities is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

        As I said in my State of the Union, I am urging the Senate to approve CTBT this year,
       in part to strengthen my hand with India before I travel there this fall.

        The Administration is working hard to persuade Senator Helms to hold hearings and
                             vote the Treaty out of Foreign Relations in time to bring it to the
                             Senate Floor this summer.

        This will be a tough fight, and I hope I can count on your support.

Savannah River and talking points
Senator Hollings may raise the issue of support for issues of concern to him regarding the future
of the Savannah River.
        Talking points:
         I know there are a number of issues with respect to the future of the Savannah River.
        Secretary Federico Pena is committed to work with you and your delegation to ensure
        these are resolved fairly.

Tobacco
In his role as the ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings will playa
leadership role in the debate over tobacco legislation. To date, the two key issues of concern for
the Senator are the $1.50 per pack price increase which the Administration has supported (he
feels $1.10 per pack is more reasonable) and appropriate compensation for tobacco farmers in his
region. The Office of Legislative Affairs believes the Senator will be a very supportive leader
throughout the Congressional consideration of this issue.

Product Liability
Senator Fritz Hollings has been the primary opponent of any kind of federal product liability
reform for twenty years. He does not support the concept of a "moderate" bill of any kind and
does not approve of the WH'g negotiations with Senator Rockefeller (WV). Hollings may raise
this issue with YOU.
