MEMORANDUM

FROM:


SUBJECT:      21 st Century Research Trust Fund


         There is growing bipartisan support for a substantial new investment in biomedical
research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This support is driven by the potential
for breakthroughs in biomedical research and by increasing concerns that the rising costs of
caring for the baby boomers will overwhelm the Medicare Trust Fund. There is also great
promise in scientific research conducted at the National Science Foundation (NSF) budget, which
funds high-quality, peer-reviewed research in a variety of disciplines lih&, biology, computer and
information science) and helps train the next generation of scientists and engineers.
         Given this potential and your commitment to research, NEC and DPC, with strong
backing from HHS, propose that you create a 21st Century Research Trust Fund. This Trust
Fund would substantially increase both biomedical and scientific research outside of the
discretionary caps, thus not jeopardizing other important investments. The amount of funding
for this Trust Fund is a policy, budget and political positioning choice. Because of the amount
of dollars necessary for such an investment to be historic, and because of the constraints imposed
by the discretionary budget caps, we believe that the increased funding should come primarily, if
not solely, from tobacco dollars. While we believe that the tobacco option is advisable, there are
important implications of including it in the budget. We will discuss these with you in the
upcoming budget meetings.

Background

        Recent progress in biomedical research has ensured that many of the diseases Americans
faced a generation ago can now be prevented or treated. Smallpox has been eradicated
throughout the entire world and polio is gone from the Western Hemisphere. Because ofa
combination of new therapies, AIDS patients can plan for a future they would have otherwise
been denied a few years ago. These successes, and many others, would not have occurred
without our Nation's strong sustained support of biomedical research.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

        We are now poised to make even more advances that could dramatically alter and
improve the way we treat diseases. There are several new technologies in medical research that
show great promise: important strides in imaging technolo~es make it possible to visualize
living cells and entire organs giving new insights into the structure of disease; computer-based
intervention systems give scientists an entire range of new tools to rapidly analyze vast amounts
of new data; and we are on the cusp of a host of breakthroughs in genetics which will enable
scientists to map the entire human genome and revolutionize how we understand, treat, and
prevent some of our most devastating diseases.

        With new knowledge about both genetics and the structure of tumors, scientists will be
able to pinpoint more effective treatments for prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer and identify
individuals at increased risk for diseases like, heart disease and stroke, Alzheimer, and severe
depression. A more precise understanding of an individual's genetic risks will enable
researchers to develop more targeted and effective medications. Finally, there is great potential
for effective vaccines for global threats, such as AIDS, malaria, and tuberculoses, and new
knowledge about the biological basis of craving and addiction will result in medications targeted
specifically to receptors in the brain that playa role in substance abUse.

       Research at the National Science Foundation also has great potential to improve health
and human capacity. NSF research in computer science, for example, accelerated NIH's
sequencing of the human genome and led to the explosion of the Internet and the World Wide
Web. Other important questions lie ahead, such as how we learn and remember and how to put
a "supercomputer" on a single chip. New resources could also expand research on
environmental issues, such as climate change and urban environment, or educational technology.

        Support for a significant investment in research is both widespread and bi-partisan.
Congress, in recent years, has appropriated more funding to NIH than we have proposed. Earlier
this year, 64 Senators signed a letter stating their support for doubling the NIH budget over the
next five years ($30 to 40 billion), and Senator Kennedy has included such a proposal in his
tobacco settlement legislation. In addition, Senators Graham, Domenici, and Liebennan have
proposed doubling all civilian-based research, including NSF and NIH.

        However, there are two major barriers to these types of investments: the discretionary
caps and the lack of funding. The structure of the discretionary budget requires that increased
funding in research comes at the expense other discretionary programs like education. To date,
this has not stopped Congress from increasing funding but could create major conflicts in the
future. Second, we simply do not have the resources available to make this kind of investment
over five years. The Balanced Budget Act reduced health spending significantly, assuring that
any major new initiative require a new source of revenue.




                                                2
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
 Options to Increase in the Research Budget

         Your advisors strongly believe that you should propose a 21 st Century Research Trust
 Fund, financed by an investment from tobacco dollars. Such a Trust Fund has great potential to
 expedite scientific break-throughs that could detect, prevent and treat serious and costly diseases.
  [Kalil: need a good half-sentence insert on NSF]. This Trust Fund would make an historic,
 multi-year commitment to biomedical research at NIH and provide for an important increase in
 basic scientific research at NSF. This Trust Fund would be established outside of the
 discretionary caps, alleviating the conflict between funding research and other priorities.

          Beyond these recommendations, an important question remains: how much of an
 investment is necessary to assure it is (and is viewed to be) an historic investment. To put the
 numbers in context, the Tobacco Settlement would invest $25 billion over 8 years in research, .
 $17.5 billion over five years. Congress has also in recent years generously funded the NIH. If
 last year's growth rate of7.1 percent were continued for 5 years, the NIH budget would increase
 by $15.8 billion. In addition, the catch phrase "doubling the NIH" has become popular in
 Congress. This means that the entire NIH budget would be twice as large in some future year
 than it is in some past year. The costs of such policies depend on which years are chosen, but in
 general are very high.

         We propose two options for the funding level of the 21 st Century Research Trust Fund.
 The first is HHS's passback "appeal" to increase the NIH budget by 8.4 percent per year. This
 would cost $19.4 billion over five year, nearly doubling the 1993 NIH budget ($10.3 billion) in
 five years, and doubling the 1998 NIH budget ($13.6 billion) by 2008. If NSF were to receive
 an analogous increase (its appeal's growth rate of7.4 percent), its funding would increase by $4
 billion over 5 years, for a sum total of $23 billion.

          The second option accepts both the NIH and NSF recommended 1999 funding level but
  reduces the growth rate in subsequent years (to bio-medical research inflation for NIH and
  general inflation for NSF). This yields a total investment of $15.1 billion over 5 years, $13
  billion for NIH and the remaining $2 billion for NSF. This approach does not allow you to say
  that we are doubling the current budget. This funding increase does double the NIH budget
. since you took office by 2008 and gives NIH and NSF their number one priority: their FY 1999
  budget requests.

        A third option [OMB: do you have a third option?]




                                                  3


                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
      Discussion

             All of your advisors support a significant increase in biomedical and scientific research
      [check]. HHS strongly advocates for the first option, to double the 1998 NllI budget by 2008.
      This bold initiative would undoubtedly receive support from public health groups, such as the
      National Breast Cancer Coalition, the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes
      Association. 1pe large infusion of funds might also trigger the kinds ofbreak-throughs not
      possible with a smaller commitment.

              However, most of your other advisors argue that $20 billion in new research spending is
      too much. The larger investment would require major funding from the tobacco, which could
      politically impossible. Even if we do choose a politically acceptable amount oftobacco
      revenue, a large research component could take away funds from other priority investments like
      child care and education. Finally, there may not be enough, quality researchers and projects to
      fund with such rapid and large budget infusions.

              On the other hand, there is some level of investment that is too low to accomplish your
      goals. Recent history suggests that Congress could outstrip our investment and lay claim to the
      role as leader in biomedical research. There is also a large and growing constituency for
      doubling the NllI budget and expectations from the research and patient advocacy community
      are high. As a consequence, an investment of $1 0 to 15 billion for NllI alone - while major by
      most measures -      may not be considered visionary.

             [OMB: if you add an option, put it here]

              Understanding their concerns, the DPCINEC believe that if you take the lead in
      substantially increasing the NllI budget and are the first to propose a credible means to pay for it,
      then your commitment will be appropriately recognized. Thus, we [Treasury?] recommend the
      second, $15 billion option. This circumvents the concerns about too large an investment while
      making an important, immediate investment in research. Clearly, the NllI and rese<1Tch
      community prefer HHS' s option, but NllI in particular seerns to be focusing on their first year
      number. We therefore believe that if you take this· option, you will get validation, but we will be
      working between now and then to ensure that this is the case. This option also funds NSF as
      well as NllI, critical, from the NEC perspective, to laying the foundation for research in the next
      century.
