                                     THE ECONOMY REMAINS ON THE RIGHT TRACK:
                                     Low UNEMPLOYMENT AND STRONG JOB GROWTH
                                                                      May2, 1997

TODAY'S DATA SHOWS THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE
1973. AND THE ECONOMY HAS CREATED MORE THAN 12 MILLION JOBS SINCE JANUARY 1993. THE
ECONOMY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE STRONG GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION.

 Unemployment -- At 4.9% -- Is the Lowest Since 1973.
          The April unemployment rate reached 4.9 -- its 32nd consecutive month below 6 and the lowest
           monthly rate since 1973. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5 . [Source: BLS.]
          The combined rate of unemployment and inflation has been lower under President Clinton than any other
           Administration since Lyndon Johnson was President. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]

   12.1 Million New jobs.
         During the Clinton Administration, the economy has added 12.1 million new jobs -- a faster annual rate of
          job growth than any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s. [Source: Based on data from the Bureau of
           Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]
          The economy has added 2.7 million jobs over the past year.

 Strong Private-Sector job Growth.
        Over the past year, the private sector has added 2.5 million jobs -- almost twice the private-sector jobs than
         during the entire four-year period before President Clinton took office. [Source: Based on data from BLS.]
        93 percent of the 12.1 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector. [Source: Based on
         data from BLS.]


   Turning The Corner In Basic American Industries.
       After losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous four years, 1,054,000 new construction jobs have been
        added since January 1993 -- that's a faster annual rate than any other Administration since Harry S Truman was
        President.
       After losing 35,000 jobs in the auto industry during the Bush years, we have 100,000 new auto jobs since President
        Clinton took office. [Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]

THIS WEEK, WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE ECONOMY GREW BY 5.6 PERCENT AT AN ANNUAL RATE IN THE
FIRST QUARTER -- THE FASTEST IN A DECADE -- WHILE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN LOW. EXPERTS
AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG:
       Allen Sinai, one of America's top economic forecasters, 4/30/97: "Job growth is good. Real income is rising.
        Sentiment is high. Unemployment is the lowest in years. Times are good for American consumers."

       Mickey Levy, chief economist, NationsBank, 2/1/97: "It's really the best of all worlds. Growth at a healthy
        pace, but with the economy not overheating and continued very favorable news on inflation."

       Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 8/3/96: "It's been a remarkable period of steady growth,
        low inflation and low unemployment."
