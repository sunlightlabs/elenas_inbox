Announcement
     Today at the White House Early Childhood Development and Learning Conference, the
      President announced a new Safe Start Initiative to help break the cycle of violence for our
      nation's youngest victims. The Safe Start Initiative will provide training to law
      enforcement, prosecutors, school personnel, probation officers, and other professionals to
    . better respond to the needs of children exposed to violence in their homes and
      communities.

The Problem
     Throughout America, too many children are exposed to violence at home, in their
      neighborhoods, and in their schools. Children's exposure to violence has been
      associated with increased depression, anger, substance abuse, and lower academic
      achievement.

      In a study conducted at Boston City Hospital, lout of every 10 children seen in their
       primary care clinic had witnessed a shooting or stabbing before the age of 6, -- half in
       their homes and half in the streets. The average age of these children was only 2.7
       years-old.

      Children who experience violence either as victims or witnesses are at increased risk of
       becoming violent themselves.

The Safe Start Initiative
     The Safe Start Initiative builds on the Child Development-Community Policing Program
      (CD-CP) model started in 1991 between the New Haven Department of Police Services
      and Yale University Child Study Center.

      In fiscal years 1995 and 1996, the Department of Justice provided funding to expand the
       model program to more cities: Buffalo, NY; Charlotte, NC; Nashville, TN; and Portland,
       OR. The Safe Start Initiative will increase the number of these regional demonstration
       sites in which community police officers partner with mental health clinicians to provide
       rapid and effective treatment to children exposed to violence.

      The Safe Start Initiative will also provide nationwide intensive training and technical
       assistance for professionals who come into contact with children who have been exposed
       to family and gang violence, violence in their community and schools, and abuse or
       neglect.

      Up to 20,000 professionals who work with children in communities across the nation will
       receive Safe Start training including: law enforcement, mental health professionals,
       prosecutors, school personnel, and probation and parole officers.

      The Department of Justice will allocate $700,000 of fiscal year 1997 discretionary
