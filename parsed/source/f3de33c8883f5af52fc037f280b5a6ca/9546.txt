Subject:         H-2A Talkers




As Barbara Chow has been making her rounds on the Hill discussing the H-2A
bill (which is attached to the C/J/S appropriations bill), Hill staff have
requested paper that they can use in their discussions with others.  This
paper would likely be widely distributed.  Please review the talking
points and provide comments to me by 1:00 pm today.  I am also circulating
the paper to DOL and USDA for their comments. Thanks for your assistance.



PS. You will need to either launch or detach the document to read the

         H-2A Agricultural Guest Workers -- Wyden-Graham Legislation

Background.

     Farm workers are among the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. Average annual
      earnings offarm worker families are only about $6,500 and farm workers are employed on
      average only about 26 weeks per year.

      Current Program.

     The H-2A "guest worker" program admits temporary nonimmigrant agricultural workers in
      order to provide farmers with an adequate supply of laborers during the growing season. There
      is no cap on the number ofH-2A visas granted annually.

     Currently there are 1.6 million farm workers in the U.S. of which approximately 600,000 are
      illegal (unauthorized to work), 1 million are legal (citizens or authorized foreign labor), and
      20,000 are in the H-2A program.

     Under the current program, in order to hire H-2A workers, an employer must
      demonstrate to the DOL that:

              (a) there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to
              perform the services; and,

              (b) there will be no adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of
              similarly-employed U.S. workers.

     Employers also are required to:

      --pay workers an "adverse effect wage rate" (AEWR), determined by the average wage
      paid to non-managerial agricultural workers in the state;

      --provide free housing to workers coming from outside the commuting area;

      --reimburse workers' inbound transportation if they complete half the contract, outbound
      also if they complete the contract; and,

      --guarantee 3/4 of the hours of the contract; and,

      --hire any qualified U.S. worker who applies during the first half of the work contract.

      State ofP/ay.

     The H-2A program has been heavily criticized by the GAO, DOL's IG, and Congress due to the
      difficult administrative burdens placed on growers.

     The Administration has acknowledged the problems and is working administratively to
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
     reengineer and streamline the H-2A program to ease grower burdens while maintaining strong
     worker protections.

    In the recent letter to the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations conferees, the
     Administration strongly urged deleting the Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and
     Security Act of 1998. The bill in its current form is unacceptable. However, the
     Administration is engaging in a bi-partisan process with the Congress to develop overall
     reform, including possible legislative reform.

    The Administration shares the goal of assuring an adequate, predictable labor supply of farm
     workers and will work with the Congress to develop reforms to the current program to ensure
     that it responds to agricultural needs while protecting U.S. farm workers.

Wyden-Graham Bill.

     As a result of growers' dissatisfaction with the current program, Senator Wyden (D/OR) and
      Senator Graham (DIFL) attached the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act of
      1998, to the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill.

     The Administration's overall concern with the Wyden-Graham bill is that it shifts costs
      and risks from employers to workers and/or the government.

     Although Wyden-Graham has been changed to remove some objectionable provisions (e.g.,
      restores the requirement that growers reimburse workers for transportation; eliminates the
      provision that would have required withholding 20% of workers' wages to be refunded upon
      their return home as a repatriation incentive), the fundamental substantive objections noted
      below, remain.

     Most significant issues with the revised proposal.

     Eliminates the current grower recruitment requirement and creates a government-run job
      registry.

      --Responsibility for the recruitment of domestic farm workers would shift to a new "job
      registry" for which the government and low-wage workers are entirely responsible.

      --Growers would only need to check this registry before employing H-2A workers.

      --The fundamental problems with the registry are:

             (1) that use of the registry would relieve the growers of any obligation to do positive
             recruitment beyond searching the registry, making it easier to employ H-2A workers
             over U.S. workers; and,

              (2) that the bill would require wholesale reliance on a method of recruitment that has
              not been tested or shown to be effective (it will be very difficult to maintain an accurate,
              up-to-date registry).
      --In addition, although this registry would take years to create and implement effectively,

       Erodes U.S. worker wages.

        --Caps the adverse effect wage rate' at 105% of the local prevailing wage.

        --This cap is not set high enough to compensate for the depression of wages in areas where
        there is a heavy reliance on foreign workers, and not sufficiently high to attract new U.S.
        workers into agricultural employment.

       Provides an inadequate mechanism for housing foreign guest workers.

        --Allows growers to provide a payment voucher in lieu of housing, unless the State certifies that
        adequate housing is not available in the area. The State is not required to make this
        determination nor has an incentive to do so.

        --Requires growers to make a "good faith" effort to locate housing for the worker. Growers
        are not required to locate and secure the housing.

         --Eliminates a fundamental grower obligation to assure that workers are adequately housed.

         --Overlooks the basic problem of inadequate housing in many areas of the country (particularly
         in the West).

         --It is unrealistic to expect low-wage foreign migrant farm workers to be able to secure housing
         using a federal voucher. Thus, many workers will likely end up without housing, will
         overcrowd any available rental housing, or will end up on the street.

        Eliminates the requirement that growers guarantee % of the work offered to recruit U.S. and
         foreign farm workers.

         --May encourage growers to lure workers from hundreds or thousands of miles away with the
         promise of potentially high earnings without any obligation to fulfill any part of that promise.

         --May encourage growers to recruit more workers than they actually need to hedge against
         uncertainties.

               'The adverse effect wage rate (AEWR) is equal to the average statewide wage. The use of the AEWR
    reflects the fact that foreign workers (both undocumented and H-2A guest workers) can sometimes dominate a local
    labor market and depress the local prevailing wage.
