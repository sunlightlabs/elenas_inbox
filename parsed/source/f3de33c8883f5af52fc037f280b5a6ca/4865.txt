MEMORANDUM FOR BRUCE REED
                ELENA KAGAN
                MIKE SMITH

FROM:                  MIKE COHEN

SUBJECT:               NATIONAL TEST COMPROMISES

The purpose of this memo is to summarize Friday's discussion about possible compromises on
the national test, to place the options we considered in a broader context, and to raise several
additional issues.

I.      Provisions already likely to be part of the fmal package
There are two key provisions already in the Senate-or House-passed bills that will almost
certainly be part of the final testing provisions.

      NAGB in control of tests: It is virtually impossible to imagine any compromise that
       won't retain this provision. However, there are several issues that are likely to come up
       before this is finalized.

        Finn and Ravitch now regret their proposal to eliminate the testing experts on NAGB, and
        to add mayors (who they view as unduly subject to local, parochial pressures). I believe
        I've read that Goodling has said that the testing experts should remain on NAGB. While
        these are not major issues, I would recommend that we agree to add back some or all of
        the testing experts, and that we hold on to the slots for mayors; we have talked about
        using one of them for a Hispanic mayor.

        AFT has raised more general concerns about NAGB's technical capacity and access to
        technical expertise. They want to make sure that NAGB can continue to rely on NCES
        staff for support. We need to make sure that the current provisions don't preclude this (I
        don't believe they do), and check with Mark Musick (NAGB's chair) about NAGB's
        views on this. In addition, within the past few weeks we have requested an additional
        $600K-$1 million for NAGB in FY 98, so that it can handle its new responsibilities. I
        need to check on the status of this request.


       National Academy of Science evaluation of 1998 pilot test: Both the House and Senate
        bills have somewhat different provisions that require the National Academy of Sciences
        to conduct an evaluation of the pilot test and report to Congress before next year's
        appropriations decisions are made. The Education Department had already been
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
       planning to contract with NAS for an evaluation, and we supported these provisions.
       The timeline for the reports is very tight, and there will be very little time between the
       March pilot test and the dates for providing the report.


II.    Possible Additional Compromises
Below are four compromise proposals that DPC and ED think we can offer and work from. We
would put them on the table one at a time, essentially in the order listed below, and use as few of
them as needed.                               .

      Linking state and/or commercial tests to the national test: NAGB would work with
       interested states and school districts, on a voluntary basis, to determine if the reading and
       math tests used by the state or local district could be statistically linked to the national test
       (or to NAEP???). If so, this would enable the state or district to administer its own
       test--instead of the national test developed by NAGB--and report the results in terms of
       national standards and achievement levels. NAGB would be given the authority to
       determine the criteria tests must meet in order for results to be reported in terms of
       national standards, and would therefore be able to determine if a state could use its own
       test as an appropriate substitute for the national test.

       At its best, this approach essentially creates a system of national content and performance
       standards in reading and math and an anchor test which is either administered to all
       students in a jurisdiction, or which becomes the benchmark against which other tests are
       calibrated. This approach therefore contemplates that more than one test that could be
       used to measure student performance against the standards, though it does not presume
       that therefore any and every 4th grade reading and 8th grade math test could be
       meaningfully linked to the national standards.

       We still have several issues to sort out under this option. First, how would this approach
       actually work, and how will we describe NAGB's authority to carry out its responsibilities
       here (do we provide general language that authorizes linking studies and requires NAGB
       to figure out, by a date certain, a plan for doing carrying out this approach, or do we need
       to spell out how this would work in some detail in the legislation itself? Second, do we.
       treat states, local school districts and commercial publishers all on the same footing?
       Can all of them "bring their test to NAGB"? Third--how do we pay for this work to get
       done? How much additional are we likely to need, and will we need additional funds in
       FY 98 or later? Should the federal government pay the total cost Of linking a test to the
       national test, or should it require some kind of cost-sharing?

       Consider 1999 as a Field Test year rather than the first year of full scale implementation:
        Instead of implementing the tests in the Spring of 1999, we would treat 1999 as a field
       test, to try out the procedures for publicizing, preparing students for, administering and
       reporting the results of the national test. Unlike the Spring 1998 pilot test which
       involves a national sample of students, this field test would involve the administration of
       the test to every student in a participating jurisdiction. We should also fund an evaluation
       of the field test.                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

       From the public's point of view, the field test is an opportunity to get the "kinks" out of
       the system before full scale implementation. From our point of view, it is a recognition
       that state and local participation is not likely to skyrocket over the next 18 months. It
       could also be an incredible marketing opportunity for us. We could work closely with a
       finite set of jurisdications to help them mobilize significant efforts to prepare kids for the
       tests, and demonstrate the value of the materials we will develop and the resources we
       will provide, such as information for parents, reading tutors, teacher training materials,
       etc. This would enable us to show that the tests are, as the President has said, " ... about
       lifting people up, not putting them down."

       There are a couple of issues we still need to address here. First, I believe we should still
       ask Congress to appropriate funds for the field test (perhaps capped at some figure). If
       so, we may want to authorize that in whatever compromise is ultimately fashioned. (If we
       are able to do this, I think we should also seriously consider Obey's proposal for making
       the administration of the tests an allowable use of Chapter II funds for subsequent years;
       while the formula isn't great, taking Obey's proposal for 2000 and beyond would provide
       specific authorization for implementation, and would take care oflong term funding for
       implementation as effectively as anything else we are likely to get.)

       Second, we need to check with the states and districts that have already signed up an see
       how such a move would affect their decision. I doubt it would have a serious impact in
       most cases (especially if we continued to fund the 1999 administration), but I want to find
       out if I'm wrong before we go too far down this road.


      Rt;port to Congress on Field Test: We could be required to submit a full report on the
       field test to Congress by a fixed deadline, after the Spring 1999 field test but before
       implementation in 2000. While we would agree to do no more than report our findings
       to Congress, there is implicit in the reporting requirement that, particularly if there are
       problems uncovered in the field test, then Congress could act to ban additional
       implementations.

      Cap oarticipation in the 1999 Field Test: If necessary, we could limit participation in the
       Field Test phase, perhaps to jurisdictions with no more than 50% of the kids.


I believe we could live with all of these provisions, although both the linking option and the field
test options increase the odds that the tests never get off the ground, either because the substitutes
are easier and less costly to use, or because the timeline is pushed back too far into the future.
Certainly taken together, these provisions would mean that the particulars of the testing
initiative--the fact that the test items will be released to the public, the procedures for reporting
test results, the material provided leading up to the test to encourage and help students, schools
and parents to prepare for the tests--more than the idea.ofnational standards and tests, will need
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
to operate well enough to capture the attention and strong interest of parents, educators and
policymakers. From that perspective, the field test may be a good thing, because it will provide a
deliberately limited but highly visible opportunity to demonstrate to the nation the value of the
tests to those who participate. We can work with states and districts to make this a success for
them and for us.

In addition, if we combine the already-required NAS report to Congress after the pilot test with
our proposed additional report after the field test, we can make a pretty strong argument that we
are giving Congress a number of additional opportunities to be involved in this initiative, to
make mid-course corrections it determines are needed based on the reports, and to end the
program if it wishes to. Consequently, we could argue more effectively that there should be no
need for a specific Congressional authorization before we proceed with implementation.

III.   Implications for Discussions with the Hispanic and Black Caucuses

Several of the options above may have implications for the issues"raised by the civil rights groups
and the caucuses.

      Testing LEP kids: Our approach to testing LEP kids has been to explore the feasibility
       of encouraging commercial publishers to link existing reading comprehension tests in
       Spanish and other languages to the national test. Our proposal for linking existing tests
       to the national tests more generally makes it easier to advance this option. Ideally, the
       statutory language we draft about the linking studies would not preclude tests in other
       languages, though I'm still inclined to try and avoid language that would explicitly permit
       it.

       We would still need to work out administration and reporting issues with interested
       districts. It occurs to me that, if we went down this road, it might well turn out to be
       easier for cities that wanted to give a linked Spanish-language reading comprehension test
       to give the English version of that test (presumably also linked to the national test) rather
       than the national test.

      High stakes testing: We have already indicated to the civil rights groups that we would
       have no problem making clear that the national test was not validated for high stakes
       purposes, and describing what kind of validation studies would need to be conducted at
       the local or state level in order for the test to be used for high stakes purposes.

       Our Field Test proposal would make it relatively easy for us to prohibit the use ofthe test
       for high stakes purposes at least until 2000--not all that the civil rights groups want, but a
       step in their direction.

       At the same time, the proposal for linking other tests to the national test could make it
       more likely that some tests that are part of this national testing system could be used for
       high stakes purposes, on the assumption that state and local tests are more likely to be
       validated for high stakes purposes. I presume that if a state or district wanted to require
                                                                            t~efi-PlJll1p   Conversion
            that kids meet the NAEP achievement level in order to be promoted, the state or district
            would have to be able to demonstrate the validity of that cut point for that particular use.

            I would anticipate that the civil rights groups would want us to prohibit high stakes
            testing for any test that is linked to national standards. This would be a huge mistake.

           RIWorting Requirements: The civil rights groups want us to use the Title 1 reporting
            requirements for the national test. State and local tests linked to the national test are
            likely to be the tests used for Title 1 purposes, and therefore will already have to meet
            these requirements. This solves some fraction of the civil rights groups concern, though
            not the major one. It isn't clear to me if these new circumstances would make it any
            easier for NAGB to require that the national tests be reported in a manner consistent with
            the Title 1 requirements, or more appropriate for us to advocate such a move.

           Accommodations: I need some help on this one. Ifwe are going to link state and local
            tests to the national test, would there need to be any specific comparability in the types of
            accommodations between the tests? Would the same answer hold true for
            inclusion/exclusion criteria for LEP kids and kids with disabilities?

      Finally, we might want to think about how we could design and conduct the field test so that we
      demonstrate and learn some things about how the tests can best be used to help low income and
      minority kids boost their achievement. This might involve several components, including, off
      the top of my head: (1) a component of the evaluation design that looks specifically at the impact
      of the testing on low income and minority students; (2) special help to participating jurisdictions
      on the most effective use of federal resources; (3) in partnership with business, community and
      other groups, a serious America Reads-like effort to mobilize out-of-school resources to help
    . kids prepare for the tests, including, for example, the intensive efforts that OBEMLA is planning
      for a number of urban communities with a focus on LEP kids and their families.
