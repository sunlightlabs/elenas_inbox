The President has established the following goals and actions to carry out this mission.

GOAL ONE: Frame a debate with a positive, forward-looking focus that transforms the way
the nation thinks and talks about race; strengthen Americans' appreciation of the value of
diversity as one of America's true strengths; and instill the sense of promise that One America
holds.

ACTIONS:
    Continuously articulate these themes in all of the President's activities involving race.
    Highlight these in all of the commmission's activities and through targeted amplifiers
     (e.g. PSAs, Cabinet involvement).
    Engage Americans on these themes through the interactive components of the initiative
     (town hall meetings, web site, etc).
    Distribute literature reflecting these core themes through the commission to schools and
     businesses that reflect this theme.

GOAL TWO: Raise the profile of racial reconciliation and understanding to a degree matched
only in times of trouble and sustain public interest.

ACTIONS:
    Introduce the initiative in a major Presidential address.
    Elevate the initiative nationally through the President's town hall meetings, regular
     meetings with the commissioners and (perhaps) a presentation of a Presidential award.
    Elevate the iniative nationally and locally through the town hall meetings, public hearings
     and policy roundtables sponsored by the commission.
    Activate Cabinet involvement with the commission and incorporate outside validators.
    Highlight the initiative through active involvement with the national media, through
     public service announcments and pa.

GOAL THREE: Confront and work to eliminate stereotypes and discrimination.

ACTIONS:
    Survey local and community groups for ideas on best practices involving these issues.
    Serve as a clearing house to distribute best practices to a wider range of community and
     governmental bodies (e.g. ministerial groups, U.S. Conference on Mayors, National
     League of Cities and National Governors Association)
    Highlight, analyze and develop strategies for overcoming common stereotypes and
     discriminatory acts through town hall meetings, public hearings and report.
    Provide recommendations for actions to eliminate certain discriminatory acts.
    Spotlight those persons, groups and businesses who exemplify One America through the
     town hall meetings, public hearings, Presidential speeches, PSAs and other means.
    (Perhaps) bestow a Presidential award or awards upon those who best exemplify One
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

       America.
      Work in partnership with non-profit organizations and businesses involved in these
       efforts and encourage others to join.

GOAL FOUR: Initiate and sustain ongoing constructive dialogue on racial issues between the
races and among races, which includes particular attention on how to maintain civil discourse on
some of these divisive issues. Foster the spread of organizations which will further provide
other meaningful interracial dialogue expansion.

ACTIONS:
    Establish and explain the importance of dialogue in President's major speech.
    Set example through Presidential participation in dialogue at town hall meetings.

     bodies (e.g. ministerial groups, U.S. Conference on Mayors, National League of Cities
     and National Governors Association).

GOAL FIVE: Deliver an accurate analysis of the progress we have achieved, our present
condition and the challenges ahead for the American public

ACTIONS:

    Undertake original research which analyzes the present state of race and race relations in
     the U.S. from town hall meetings, hearings,
    Study the changing demographics of the U.S. over the next fifty-two years.

GOAL SIX: Provide a more accurate picture to the American people of themselves and of
people different from themselves so that they begin to understand how race affects their
perception of many things, and with that understanding, better respect the views of people of
different races.

      Highlight common perceptions held by certain groups about themselves and others at
       town hall meetings and public hearings.
      Deliver insightful accurate information that addresses those perceptions.
      Analyze how these perceptions are created and recommend effective ways for dealing
       with them.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

this country's dynamic racial composition.

ACTIONS:
    Distribute specific action items that private citizens, acting as individuals, can pursue.
    Implement recommendations.
    Distribute the report as "a living document" through video for example, which could
     include the President speaking to the issue, the results of the report, footage of town hall
     meetings and other meetings, brief shots of commissioners and "real people."
                                                                         Hex-DiJmp COilvc:sioil .


Build a new consensus for this iniative locally and nationally that allows us to implement the
commission's recommendations.
-- from school curricula to improvements in the workplace, to modifications in the criminal
justice system --

In fulfilling the iniative's mission, this effort should focus on a few areas that are vital to
delivering the promise of America to all Americans: the right to a free and quality education,
employment, housing, criminal justice, melting pot tensions, youth, economic issues, violence
and global economic leadership.
