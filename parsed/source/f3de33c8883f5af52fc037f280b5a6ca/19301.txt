MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report


        Health Care -- Democratic Unveil Patients' Bill of Rights: Today, the Democratic
Leadership introduced their version of the patients' bill of rights in a ceremony attended by Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman. Your letter to the Leadership, which indicated strong support for this
bill without providing an all out endorsement, was extremely well received. This legislation
includes every patient protection recommended by your Advisory Commission on Consumer
Protection and Quality. It builds on these recommendations and includes an enforcement
provision that allows remedies achieved through the state courts. Because this provision would
preempt ERISA, it is the most controversial aspect of the bill and has already attracted strong
opposition from the employer community. This legislation also includes a compromise
whistleblower protection that is acceptable to the labor community and not serious objectionable
to the hospital community. We helped draft this compromise provision, and Congressman
Dingell and Senator Kennedy were extremely appreciative of our help in this regard.

         Health Care -- On Track to Cover One Million Children at Sixth Month
Anniversary ofthe Children's Health Insurance Program: Wednesday marks the sixth
month anniversary of the Children's Health Insurance Program. Donna Shalala, in an event with
Bruce Reed and Gene Sperling, will announce the approval of New York and Illinois children's
health plans. With these two new approvals, eight states will have come into this new program
and will provide health care coverage for one million children. At this event, we will also be
releasing a NECIDPC report on the rapid implementation of this new program. The report
illustrates that an additional 15 states have already submitted proposals to HHS to expand health
care coverage and that virtually every other state has a process underway to submit a proposal.

        Political Reform -- Free Television Petition: Chairman Kennard and key members of
Congress reached an agreement last week in which the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) agreed to postpone rulemaking procedures on your request to establish a system of free
television time and move instead to a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) next month. Although this maybe
perceived by some in the press as temporary setback, in reality the NOI will not change the
timetable for the implementation of a free television time rule and the strategy of going to an NOI
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
was supported by the reform groups. The NO! will provide enough time for the
Moonves-Ornstein Commission to finish their work next Fall after which the FCC can go
forward with a rulemaking procedure. The key question is whether the Moonves-Ornstein
Commission can develop an acceptable compromise between the broadcasters and the reformers
that will build support in Congress for an FCC rulemaking.

        Drunk Driving -- .08 BAC: On Monday, March 30, there was a Roosevelt Room event
held with Secretary Shalala, Deputy Attorney General Holder, Rep. Lowey, and others to push
the House of Representatives to enact a uniform standard on drunk driving as part of pending
ISTEA legislation. Rep. Lowey is the House sponsor of the Lautenberg amendment -- which
passed the Senate by 62-32 -- and would give states three years to enact .08 BAC laws or risk
losing highway construction funds. [The House Rules Committee is scheduled to decide this
afternoon (Tuesday) whether to allow the Lowey .08 BAC amendment to be offered to ISTEA.
WH Legislative Affairs predicts that the Lowey amendment will not make it through the Rules
Committee, and it will be left as an issue for the conference committee to resolve.]

        Crime -- Assault Weapons: The Treasury Department is near completion of its report
in response to your November 1997 directive on modified assault weapons. As you recall, you
directed Secretary Rubin to temporarily suspend the importation of certain modified assault rifles
while Treasury determined whether or not these rifles complied with the "sporting purposes test"
and could be legally imported under the Gun Control Act of 1968. We expect that Treasury will
recommend permanently banning from importation the 5 basic types of modified assault rifles
studied, which represent more than 50 specific models. This will include AK-47- and Uzi-type
models. We have tentatively planned to release the report at an April 6 event.

         Children and Families -- After-School Event: In response to a recent DPC memo on
your education agenda, you indicated an interest in doing an after-school event. Weare
planning an event in May to: (1) announce the first grants ofthe 21st Century Learning Centers
Program, as funded in FY 98; (2) release a joint report by the Department of Justice and the
Department of Education on the effect of after-school programs on reducing crime and
improving school performance; and (3) announce the pilot cities for the Administration's effort
to coordinate federal funding and oversight of after-school programs, which you announced as
part of your child care proposal. Ideally, this event would take place at a high quality
after-school program (like the one at Temple University you suggested), or a program that will
receive a 21 st Century Learning Centers grants. This event will help demonstrate how
after-school programs can keep children safe and improve their performance in school, which
will in tum help build support for this initiative in the appropriations process. At this time, the
Department of Education is working closely with Senator Jeffords to ensure his strong support of
our proposed expansion of the program in the appropriations process.

       Welfare -- Agreement Reached to Restore Food Stamps to Legal Immigrants: A
conference committee reached agreement last week on a plan to restore $818 million over five



                                                2             Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion ·

years in food stamps to legal immigrants. The President's budget proposed to restore $2.5
billion for this purpose.

       The conference agreement reflects the Administration's request for refugees and asylees,
the Hmong, and the disabled. For refugees and asylees, it would lengthen from 5 to 7 years the
period oftime that they are eligible for food stamps after they arrive in the U.S., giving them
more time to naturalize. Hmong immigrants from Laos who assisted the U.S. in Vietnam and
then came to the U.S. War would remain eligible for food stamps. Disabled legal immigrants
who entered the country before welfare reform was passed and who became disabled after they
entered the country would also retain food stamps.

        The agreement differs from the Administration's proposal in two respects. First, it will
provide food stamps for children who were here when the law was signed, but not their parents.
The President's budget would cover both children and their parents, and both those here when the
law was signed and those who arrived after. Second, the agreement will retain eligibility for the
elderly who were 65 or older and in the U.S. when the welfare law was signed. Our budget
proposal would have gone further, also providing benefits to those who were in the country when
the law was signed and who subsequently tum 65.

       A major source of funding for these restorations is a cutback in funding for food stamps
administrative costs, based on the rationale that states are able to claim these costs twice, under
both food stamp and the T ANF block grant. States dispute this rationale.

        We are now monitoring whether this bill will have difficulty passing on the floor of both
houses. If it does pass, the next question is whether we will have a chance to do additional
restorations later this year through other vehicles.

        Welfare -- High Performance Bonus: Rep. Shaw has taken issue with our formula for
distributing high performance bonus funds under T ANF because it does not include any measure
of state success in improving family formation, including increasing two-parent families and
reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies. In developing our measures of success, we chose to focus
on work-oriented measures -- job entry, retention, and gain in earnings -- partly because of the
difficulty of developing family formation measures that fairly measure state performance. Shaw
charges that our approach is at odds with the purpose of the high performance bonus under the
statute. We plan to meet with him in the coming week to discuss next steps.

         Disability Issues -- Legislative Action on Disability Issues: There was action on the
Hill in the past two weeks on the disability community's two highest priorities. We are sorting
out whether the Administration will be able to support these initiatives, in full or in part.

        First, the House held a hearing on how to allow more people with disabilities to live in
their communities instead of nursing homes. Disability advocates, led by the group ADAPT, are
pushing legislation known as CASA. Advocates do not expect CASA to become law because of


                                                 3
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
its cost ($10-20 billion per year), but they hope it will start a dialogue on the subject. HHS
witnesses testified that we have concerns about the cost, but said we are pushing to achieve the
goals of the legislation through more modest steps such as demonstrations. Speaker Gingrich
testified in favor ofthis concept, although without endorsing CASA itself. The disability
community is disappointed that we have not been more supportive. We have proposed that you
send a letter to Speaker Gingrich describing what progress HHS has made and stating your
agreement with the legislation's goals, but OMB has expressed reservations about such a letter.

        Second, legislation is moving in both houses to encourage people with disabilities on the
ssm or SSI rolls to return to work. Senators Jeffords and Kennedy just introduced a bill in the
Senate, while Reps. Bunning and Kennelly's bill was just marked up in the House. The
sticking point in both of these proposals is that they would allow people to retain Medicare or
Medicaid after they retUrn to work, which HHS and OMB are both inclined to oppose because of
costs. Our opposition to this legislation would be a major disappointment to the community,
particularly in the wake of your signing the executive order to help increase employment of
people with disabilities. We are working with HHS and OMB to identify what portions of these
bills we are able to support and what alternatives we may have to offer.

         Welfare Reform -- Federal Hiring Initiative: The Vice President will participate in an
event on April 9th to mark the one-year anniversary of the Cabinet meeting where you asked
Federal agencies to develop plans to hire welfare recipients. The initiative is proceeding well.
Agencies have hired nearly 3,700 welfare recipients and are on track to meet the
government-wide goal of 10,000 by 2000. The VP will announce these latest numbers, release
an annual report highlighting agency accomplishments and lessons learned (the report includes a
brief message from you), encourage companies who do business with the federal government to
do their part, and urge cabinet members to leverage these commitments with the contractor
community. The VP will be joined by at least one cabinet member (hopefully Secretary Pena,
who has been particularly proactive about reaching out to contractors), at least one business from
the Welfare to Work Partnership Board (United's CEO encouraged the federal government to
reach out.to our contractors just as they have reached out to their supplier network), and one
former welfare recipient. Letters to each Cabinet member have been prepared for your signature
thanking them for leadership on this issue and encouraging them to continue supporting this
initiative within their agency, stakeholder groups, and contractor community.

         Welfare Reform -- APWA Resolution: Last week, the American Public Welfare
 Association passed a resolution urging Congress to enact your two FY 99 budget initiatives
 related to welfare reform: the $100 million a year Access to Jobs initiative included in the ISTEA
 reauthorization and the $283 million a year proposal to provide 50,000 housing vouchers to help
 people leaving welfare to get or keep a job. The Access to Jobs initiative is currently
 authorized at $150 million in the Senate ISTEA bill and $42 million in the bill moving through
 the House. APW A urges the House to adopt the Senate funding level. While there has been
.considerable support for linking housing vouchers to welfare-to-work, HUD expects that it will
 be an uphill fight to get funding for these vouchers given larger Congressional concerns


                                                 4
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion '

regarding Section 8. We are working with HUD, DOT and HHS on a joint secretarial event to
rally support for both initiatives in late April.

       Education Opportunity Zones. Rep. Clay is planning to introduce your Education
Opportunity Zones bill on April 1, before the Congressional recess. We are planning an
event that will focus on this proposal later in April, possibly in New York, Los Angeles or
San Francisco.

        National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. We have been working very
closely with the NBPTS to devise a strategy for securing continued federal support in light
of Goodling's move last week to end federal funding for the Board. Gov. Hunt and the
Board President Jim Kelley have been very pleased to learn of your strong support in the
face of this threat. Because the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will mark
up the Higher Education Act this week, we have worked to ensure that a provision
eliminating the Board's funding will not be included in the Senate version. Once the
mark-up is completed, we believe that a high profile veto threat will be an appropriate and
effective step. We believe that your scheduled event with the National Teacher of the Year
at the end of April, right after Congress reconvenes, will be a good time to issue a veto
threat.
