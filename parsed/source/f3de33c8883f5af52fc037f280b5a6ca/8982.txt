    PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS AND THAT FEDERAL HEALTH PLANS CONTINUE TO
                     IMPLEMENT PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS
                                 August 10,1998

Today, in a speech in Louisville, Kentucky, the President outlined the inadequacies of the
GingrichlLott patients' bills of rights, showing that they have more loopholes than protections.
He announced that if Congress sends him such flawed legislation, he would veto it. While the
Republican Leadership stalls on passing a real patients' bill of rights, the President continues to
implement patient protections for the 85 million Americans in federal health plans. Today, the
Office of Personnel Management is releasing a new regulation to prohibit gag rules, as part of its
efforts to meet the President's directive to bring all Federal health plans into compliance with the
patients' bill of rights. Today, the President:

ANNOUNCED HE WOULD VETO THE GINGRICH-LOTT PROPOSALS THAT ARE
MORE LOOPHOLES THAN PATIENT PROTECTIONS. The President said that these
Republican proposals:

Contain Empty Promises. Many of the provisions in the Republican plans are symbolic gestures
rather than real patient protections. As the American Nurses Association says: "Republican
leaders who promise protection from managed care abuses for patients only deliver slogans for
the patients and protections for the managed care industry." For example these bills:

      Let HMOs, not health professionals, define medical necessity. The Republican
       Leadership proposals provide for an external appeals process, but make this process
       meaningless by allowing HMOs themselves, rather than independent health professionals,
       to define what services are medically necessary. This loophole will make it very difficult for
       patients to prevail on an appeal to get the treatment their doctors believe they need.

      Allow financial incentives to threaten critical patient care. The Republican legislation
       purports to protect patients from financial incentives to limit care, but applies this
       protection in only a very narrow set of circumstances. The bills thus leave most patients,
       in most health care settings, vulnerable to financial incentives that limit patient care. By
       pretending remove those incentives, while allowing them to go forward, the Republican
       Leadership bills mislead patients as to the risks of improper care.

Leave Out Essential Protections For Patients. The Republican Leadership proposals fail to include
several critical patient protections. The National Breast Cancer Coalition, raising concerns about
the absence of important protections, says that "if these bills are enacted, it could be devastating for
the thousands of women who undergo breast cancer treatment every year." The Republican
Leadership proposals:

      Fail to guarantee direct access to specialists. The Republican Leadership proposals fail
       to ensure that patients with serious health problems have direct access to the specialists
       they need. For example, patients with cancer or heart disease may be denied access to the
       doctors they need to treat their conditions.

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                          .HeX-Dump Conversion
       fail to assure continuity of care when an employer changes health plans. This deficiency
       means that pregnant women or individuals undergoing care for a chronic illness may
       have their care suddenly altered mid course, potentially causing adverse health
       consequences.

      Fail to compensate patients who have suffered harm as a result of a wrongful health plan
       action. The proposed per day penalties in the Republican Leadership plans fail to compensate
       patients who suffer serious harm or even death because of a health plans' wrongful action. For
       example, if a health plan improperly deny a lifesaving cancer treatment to a child, it will only
       incur a penalty for the number of days it takes to reverse its decision but will not have to pay
       the family for all the damages it will suffer as the result of having a child with a now untreatable
       disease. And because the plan will not have to pay for all the harm it causes, it will have
       insufficient incentives to change health care practices for the future.

Reverse Course on Some Critical Protections. In some areas, the Republican Leadership bills
undermine current patient protections that are law today. The American Medical Association
says that these bills "would roll back vital patient protections enacted in the states." Similarly,
the Kentucky Chapter of the American College of Physicians says that "the Republican bills
basically gutted the 'prudent layperson standard'" that assure real emergency room protections.
The Republican bills:

      Undermine existing medical privacy protections. The House Republican Leadership bill
       would preempt some existing medical privacy protections guaranteed by state law,
       without putting any protections in their place. As a result, the bills would increase the
       number of individuals who can review and give out health records without a patient's
       knowledge or consent.

      Reverse course on emergency room protections. The Republican Leadership proposals
       back away from the emergency room protections that Congress implemented for
       Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The
       Republican bills include a watered-down provision that does not require health plans to
       cover patients who go to an emergency room outside their network and does not ensure
       coverage for any treatment beyond an initial screening. These provisions put patients at
       risk for the huge costs associated with critical emergency treatment.

Leave Millions of Americans Out in the Cold. The Republican Leadership bills do not apply to all
health plans and therefore leave out millions of Americans. As the American Nurses Association
says: "we will not agree to leave a large segment ofthe population unprotected." The bills:

      Do not cover all health plans. Both Republican Leadership bills leave millions of Americans
       unprotected. The Lott proposal, for example, covers only self-insured plans, thus leaving out
       100 million Americans, including millions of Americans in small businesses. These
       Americans are held hostage to the hope that states will provide them with every patient
       protections that the Republicans in Congress will not.

                                                                    Automated Ftecords Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
the Republican Leadership delays passing strong patient protections, the Clinton Administration
is implementing the patients' bill of rights for the 85 million Americans in Federal health plans.
The President:

      Announced release of anti-gag regulation. Today, the President announced that the Office
       of Personnel Management (OPM) is releasing a new regulation prohibiting plans participating
       in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) from using gag clauses. This
       regulation will ensure that health professionals can discuss all medical treatment options with
       their patients. Earlier this year, OPM notified all participating health plans that they must
       provide other new patient protections -- including assuring access to specialists, continuity of
       care, and access to emergency room services -- to their enrollees. FEHBP has 350
       participating llel}lth plans that serve 9 million federal employees and their families, including
       over 100,000 people in Kentucky.

      Built on efforts to extend patients' bill of rights to all Federal health plans.
                                                                                 In June, the
       Department of Health and Human Services extended the patients' bill of rights to the 40
       million Americans who receive Medicare. Last month, the Department of Veterans' Affairs
       began to put in place a new, rapid appeals process for the 3 million veterans who receive health
       care. Last week, the Department of Defense issued a directive to all military bases throughout
       the world, extending patient protections to 8 million servicemen and women and their families
       at nearly 600 hospitals and clinics around the world.
