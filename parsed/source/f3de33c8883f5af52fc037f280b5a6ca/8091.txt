                    The McCain Bill Is Tougher than Ever on Teen Smoking


        The Senate is moving much closer to passing the McCain bill, the toughest anti-youth
         smoking legislation in history. The McCain bill would save a million lives over the
         next five years by:

               Raising the price of cigarettes by $1.10 over the next five years -- the single
                most important step we can take to reduce youth smoking.

               Imposing tough lookback surcharges on tobacco companies if youth smoking
                does not decline by 67% over the next decade.

               Reaffirming FDA's full authority over tobacco products.

               Launching major nationwide efforts to reduce youth smoking, including a
                nationwide counteradvertising campaign to warn young people riot to smoke, state
                and local tobacco education and prevention programs, and tough enforcement
                measures to stop retailers from selling cigarettes to minors.

               Taking other important steps to protect against the dangers of smoking,
                including expanded warning labels on cigarettes, mandatory disclosure of
                additives and cigarette ingredients, a nationwide ban on smoking in public
                buildings, and substantial funding for smoking cessation programs.

               Funding a major increase in health research at the National Institutes of Health
                and the Centers for Disease Control, including clinical trials for cancer patients.

        The McCain bill started strong. .. The Administration worked to secure several
         important improvements to the bill that passed the Commerce Committee by a margin of
         19-1 in April -- including stronger lookback surcharges, stronger environmental tobacco
         smoke protections, elimination of the antitrust exemption and of liability protection for
         parent companies, and substantial funding for public health and research as well as for
         states and tobacco farmers.

        ... and has gotten stronger. The full Senate passed an amendment by Senator Durbin
         to increase company-specific lookback surcharges still further, and rejected an
         amendment by Senator Ashcroft to remove the price increase from the bill. The Senate
         has authorized additional uses for tobacco revenues -- with amendments on veterans
         health, drug prevention, and (later today) targeted tax relief -- but the core efforts to .
         reduce youth smoking and protect the public health remain fully intact.
                                                                          Automated Records Management System
     Tobacco and Tax Cuts                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

             We did not seek to include a tax cut in the bill. But if a tax cut was necessary for the
     tobacco bill to pass the Senate, both the Democratic and Republican proposals are as progressive
     and targeted to working families as we could ask for:

                  This version is dramatically scaled-back: Under pressure from Senator
                   McCain and other tobacco bill proponents, Senator Gramm offered a significantly
                   scaled-back version of his tax cut amendment. His original proposal was $54
                   billion over 4 years. The revised version is $16 billion over 4 years.

                  The Republican proposal comes a long way in the Democrats' direction: We
                   would have preferred the Democratic proposal, but the Democratic and
                   Republican proposals are not that far apart. Both include a health insurance tax
                   cut for the self-employed and a tax cut for low- and middle-income married
                   couples. The Democratic alternative costs $30 billion over 9 years and a quarter
                   of the money after that. The Republican alternative costs $46 billion over 9 years
                   and a third of the money after that. (Note: Under the Republican alternative, if
                   the youth smoking targets are met and youth smoking declines by 67% over the
                   next decade, the tax cut can grow to half the money.)

                  This is one of the most progressive tax cuts since the EITC: The Democratic
                   alternative gives tax relief to married couples with incomes under $60,000. The
                   Republican alternative is limited to married couples with incomes under $50,000.
                   Both also remove the marriage penalty for married recipients of the Earned
                   Income Tax Credit.

                  Opponents of the tobacco bill have no more excuses: Now that the tobacco
                   bill includes a substantial tax cut (and anti-drug provisions), Republicans have run
                   out of excuses to oppose the bill. This will put even more pressure on the Senate
                   to act quickly and the House of Representatives to follow suit.

     Tobacco and Drugs

                  Just politics: The Coverdell amendment is more a political statement than a
                   serious effort to reduce drug use. It includes a handful of provisions that have
                   little to do with drug use or tobacco -- such as school vouchers for students who
                   have been the victim of violence, infringement on collective bargaining at the
                   Customs Service, and a ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs.

                  Just authorizations, not mandatory spending: The Coverdell amendment
                   does not necessarily reduce spending on any other program, or require spending
                   on drug programs. It simply authorizes a number of drug programs that will have
                   to compete with the most popular and central public health provisions of the bill,
                   such as counteradvertising, smoking cessation, licensing and enforcement.
