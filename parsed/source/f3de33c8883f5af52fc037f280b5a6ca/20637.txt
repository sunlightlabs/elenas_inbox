           INSURERS' BILL OF RIGHTS THAN A PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS
                                  July 15, 1998

After nine months of ignoring the President's call for a strong enforceable, bipartisan patients' bill of rights,
the Senate Republicans have responded with a rhetoric-laced, partisan proposal that places the interests of
insurers above the needs of patients. The proposal, for which their continues to be no legislative language,
falls far short of what patients need to ensure that their health plans provide patients with basic health care
needs. The fact that Republicans have yet to introduce a bill with less than 40 days left in this Congress
raises serious questions as to whether they are truly committed to passing a bill of rights or selling a
bill of goods American public. The Republican proposal falls short in many areas. For example, it:

      Does not provide the majority of Americans aU of the patient protections they need. The
       Republican proposal, however inadequate, only applies to Americans in self-insured plans and
       excludes the majority of Americans. Therefore, those tens of million of Americans excluded from
       these protections would only have the rights they need if every state passed every protection into law.

               States patients rights laws do' not provide the protections patients need. No state has
               passed all of the protections in the patients' bill of rights, and most states have passed only a
               few or none of the protections. For example, as many as twenty states have not passed
               protections that assure patients access to the specialists they. need.

               Unfair to Americans in small businesses. Most Americans who work in small businesses
               would not be protected by the Senate Republican proposal. The plan explicitly excludes
               these Americans from these protections and holds them hostage to the hope that every state
               will some day pass these protections.

               Inconsistent with the bipartisan Kassebaum-Kennedy law. Rejects bipartisan
               Kassebaum-Kennedy approach that guarantees insurance protections are extended to all
               Americans. There is no reason the patients' bill of rights should not follow this same
               structure.

      Does not guarantee access to specialists. Assuring access to needed specialists is an absolutely
       essential protection. We have heard again and again about patients who could not see
       oncologists or specialists to treat heart conditions or diabetes. The Senate Republicans do not
       assure that patients with critical health needs have access to the specialists they need.

      Does not limit or require disclosure of financial incentives for doctors. Patients should not be
       put at risk through unknown destructive financial incentives to limit patient care. The Senate
       Republican proposal explicitly does not provide patients this important protection.

      Doe not compensate patients who are maimed or who die as a result of a wrongful health plan
       action. A right without a remedy is simply not a right. The Senate Republican proposal does
       not have any recourse for patients who are maimed or injured by their health plans. Because it
       has no enforcement provision, plans who ignore the patient protections will not be held
       accountable. Moreover, this provision is even weaker than the House Republican proposal.

The President Remains Committed to Passing a Strong Enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights in This
Congress. Notwithstanding his concerns, he will work to pass a strong enforceable patients' bill of rights
