SUBJECT:       Welfare to Work Proposal

Attached for your information is the one-pager we sent out late last week outlining the
Administration's position on the design ofthe $3 billion welfare-to-work fund. Also attached
are one-page summaries of two other proposals, by the House Ways and Means Republicans and
by House Democrats.

We held a productive meeting this afternoon with the Departments of Labor, HFIS, HUD, and
Treasury. It appears this process is moving quickly, with House Ways and Means planning to
develop its draft legislation this weekend. We agreed that we should emphasize the following
list of priorities to House Ways and Means staff at our meeting tomorrow morning:

       At least (?) 50% of the funds should go to cities.   (The House Republican proposal
        would funnel all the money to states.)

      All the funds should be distributed on a competitive basis, with a preference to areas with
       high poverty and unemployment. A portion of the funds should be set aside as a
       performance-based bonus. (The House Republicans would distribute at least 80% of the
       funds on a formula basis.)

      States and cities should be permitted to use the funds to create public sector jobs in areas
       of high unemployment. (The House Republicans would not permit this.)

      We must include strong language prohibiting worker displacement. (The House
       Republican draft does not include this.)

The House Democratic alternative is somewhat vague, but it basically comports with our views
on all of these issues.

I should note how the exact language of the budget agreement compares with the issues above.
It reads that the funds shall be "allocated to states through a formula and targeted within a State
to areas" with high poverty and unemployment. "A share of the funds would go to
cities/counties with large poverty populations .... "

We still have a number of more technical issues where we must clarify the Administration's
position, such as how the performance bonus would work, whether job training is an allowable
use of the funds, and whether economic development projects that would employ welfare
recipients would qualify for funding. The most important unresolved issue is one that Secretary
Shalala will raise with you tomorrow. Now that we have clarified our position that the
Department of Labor should administer this program, she does not believe that it should be part
though the budget agreement refers to this as being part ofTANF.

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
