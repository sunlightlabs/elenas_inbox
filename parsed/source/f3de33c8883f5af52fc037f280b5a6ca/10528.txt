Subject:         Abortion/Embryos/Cloning and other Selected L/HHS General
Provisions

Attached is a table of selected Labor/HHS General Provisions related to
health that will require policy decisions in order to print the FY 2000
Budget Appendix. Typically, the Budget has shown the prior year's (i.e.,
FY 1999 enacted) appropriations language, and brackets language proposed
for deletion, and italicizes any new or revised language.

The file is a legal landscaped document that needs to be launched.
 It shows:

1.         The FY 1998 enacted language.

2.         Our proposed language in the FY 1999 Budget.

3.         The FY 1999 enacted language.

4.         Our initial recommendations for the FY 2000 Budget.

5.      A column where you can indicate whether you agree/disagree/or
would like to discuss.

Due to the FY 2000 Budget print schedule, we are requesting your
views/comments on these General Provisions by COB, Tuesday January 5th.
If necessary. I will call a meeting on Wednesday morning to resolve any
outstanding issues.  Please indicate in the attached wordperfect file your
recommendations, or call me or Ann Kendrall (x54925) with your comments.

We will also be sending around very shortly a Government-wide abortion
language tracker to ensure that the Administration addresses abortion
issues consistently throughout the FY 2000 Budget.
