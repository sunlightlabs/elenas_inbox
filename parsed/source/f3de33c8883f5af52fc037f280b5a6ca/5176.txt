       On November 10, you will host the White House Conference on Hate Crimes at George
Washington University. This memorandum outlines the purpose and structure of the
conference, and the policy initiatives that we recommend you announce at the conference.

Purpose and Structure of the Conference

           The White House Conference on Hate Crimes has three purposes. First, it will call
national attention to the serious problem of hate crime in this country and, by highlighting
positive community responses, promote unity in addressing the problem. Second, it will
demonstrate the Administration's commitment to "draw the line" on hate crimes through
combined law enforcement, education, and prevention strategies. Finally, this conference is the
Race Initiative event for the month of November.

        The conference will highlight the role oflaw enforcement and prosecutors at the state,
local, and national level. The conference also will explore how the public and private sectors
can join together in combating hate crime through law enforcement, community efforts, and
educational strategies.

       Brealifast in the East Room. The Conference will begin with a breakfast in the East
Room for the approximately 350 participants. The Attorney General will introduce you, and you
will make brief welcoming remarks.

       Morning Session. The morning session will begin with welcoming remarks by Maria

       his involvement.


       During your remarks, we propose that you announce several significant new law
enforcement and prevention initiatives, including a proposal to expand the principal federal hate
crimes statute, 18 U;S.C. 245. These initiatives are detailed later in this memorandum.

                                                 3
Policy Announcements to be Made at the Conference                      He~텱ump   Conversion

       We recommend that you make the following policy announcements at the Conference.

I.     LEGISLATION

      You can announce the Administration's support for legislation to expand the principal
       federal hate crimes statute, 18 U.S.c.  245, to include gender, sexual orientation, and
       disability. Currently, Section 245 prohibits hate crimes only on the basis of race, color,
       religion, or national origin. For the three new categories, this option would require proof
        of a Commerce Clause nexus as an element of the offense. This Commerce Clause hook
       is drafted in a way intended to satisfy constitutional concerns in the least restrictive
       manner possible .. Senator Kennedy, along with Senator Spector, is expected to introduce
       this legislation.

       There is some concern that the addition of gender would greatly expand the number of
                            cases that would require investigation by federal agents. In order
                            to address this concern, the Administration supports several
                            limiting principles that would reduce the number of cases actually
                            investigated and prosecuted by the federal government, including
                            limiting the new categories of cases to those involving bodily
                            injury and providing guidance to federal investigators and
                            prosecutors to limit the number of cases to those involving
                            gender-based motivation of a weight sufficient to implicate a
                            strong federal interest in prosecution.

II.    PROSECUTION AND ENFORCEMENT

       Creation ofa Network of Local Hate Crime Working Groups. You can announce
        the formation of, or federal participation in, local hate crime working groups across the
        country. Each U.S. Attorney will either establish a local working group in his or her
        district, or, if such a body already exists, actively participate in the group. These
        working groups would be federal-state-Iocal partnerships that would be the primary
        mechanism for evaluating and addressing the hate crime problem of the local community.
         Members of the working groups would be the U.S. Attorney's offices, the FBI, state and
        local law enforcement, state and local prosecutors, and advocacy groups. In addition to
        addressing law enforcement strategies, the groups would seek to increase enforcement of
        hate crime laws, to maximize reporting of hate crimes, and to educate the public about
      . hate crimes. There will also be a National Hate Crimes Working Group, located at the
        Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., that would have the role of coordinating the
        work of all the working groups across the country. As part of this coordinating function,
        the National Hate Crimes Working Group would distribute, on an ongoing basis,
        information regarding promising practices that are occurring out in the field to address the


                                                4
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
        problem of hate crimes.

       Assignment of New Hate Crime Resources. You may announce that the
        Administration will assign new resources for hate crimes enforcement. The
        Administration will assign significant additional FBI agents and prosecutors to hate crime
        cases. In addition, the Administration plans to create a Civil Rights Analytical Center at
        the FBI.

       Encourage hate crimes training for law enforcement. . You can announce the
        development of a model law enforcement training curricula on hate crimes which can be
        incorporated into programs at local and state law enforcement training centers. This
        curriculum includes three course segments -- one segment directed to law enforcement
        officers, one segment to investigators, and one general segment for others in the law
        enforcement field. This curriculum would be available within 60 days for
        implementation at law enforcement training facilities across the country.


III.    STATISTICS REGARDING HATE CRIMES


       Adding Hate Crime Questions to the National Crime Victimization Survey
        ("NCVS"). The NCVS is an annual survey conducted by the Department of Justice's
        Bureau of Justice Statistics to measure levels of crime through a national sampling of
        victims of crime. At present, it does not include questions about hate crime. Beginning
        in January of 1998, the Department of Justice will include questions related to hate crime
        as part of its annual survey of victims of personal crimes and vandalism. The survey will
        inquire whether the victim believes the incident was bias-motivated and why. In
        addition, the Department of Justice will be conducting extended versions of the NCVS in
        eleven cities across the country from January through April of next year, including
        expanded questioning regarding hate crimes.

IV.     EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES

        Teacher's resource guide for hate crimes awareness and Hate Crimes Internet Site.
         You can announce the development of a manual for educators on preventing youth hate
         crime. The Department of Justice and the Department of Education have drafted a guide
         for teachers that encourages schools and school districts to confront hate-motivated
         behavior among students; promotes development of comprehensive, programmatic
         responses to prejudice and violence; and provides educators with various resources to
       . undertake such responses. You can announce that the Attorney General and the
         Secretary of Education will send a copy of the manual to each of the country's 16,000
         school districts by December I. You can also announce the availability of a website,
         "Hateful Acts Hurt Kids," linked to the Department of Justice website. This site will


                                                5
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
address prejudice, discrimination, and related issues in an interactive, graphic format
designed.for children in kindergarten through fifth grade, their parents, and teachers.
This site will be available for viewing at the Conference.

Policy Announcements to be Made at the Conference

      We recommend that you make the following policy announcements at the Conference.

I.    LEGISLATION

     You can announce the Administration's support for legislation to expand the principal
      federal hate crimes statute, 18 U.S.C.  245, to include gender, sexual orientation, and
      disability. Currently, Section 245 prohibits hate crimes only on the basis of race, color,
      religion, or natiorial origin. For the three new categories, this option would require proof
       of a Commerce Clause nexus as an element of the offense. This Commerce Clause hook
      is drafted in a way intended to satisfy constitutional concerns in the least restrictive
      manner possible. Senator Kennedy, along with Senator Spector, is expected to introduce
      this legislation.

      There is some concern that the addition of gender would greatly expand the number of
                           cases that would require investigation by federal agents. In order
                           to address this concern, the Administration supports several
                           limiting principles that would reduce the number of cases actually
                           investigated and prosecuted by the federal government, including
                           limiting the new categories of cases to those involving bodily
                           injury and providing guidance to federal investigators and
                           prosecutors to limit the number of cases to those involving
                           gender-based motivation of a weight sufficient to implicate a
                           strong federal interest in prosecution.

II.   PROSECUTION AND ENFORCEMENT

     Creation of a Network of Local Hate Crime Working Groups. You can announce
      the formation of, or federal participation in, local hate crime working groups across the
      country. Each U.S. Attorney will either establish a local working group in his or her
      district, or, if such a body already exists, actively participate in the group. These
      working groups would be federal-state-local partnerships that would be the primary
      mechanism for evaluating and addressing the hate crime problem of the local community.
       Members of the working groups would be the U.S. Attorney's offices, the FBI, state and
      local law enforcement, state and local prosecutors, and advocacy groups. In addition to
      addressing law enforcement strategies, the groups would seek to increase enforcement of
      hate crime laws, to maximize reporting of hate crimes, and to educate the public about
      hate crimes. There will also be a National Hate Criines Working Group, located at the
      Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., that would have the role of coordinating the
      work of all the working groups across the country. As part of this coordinating function,
      the National Hate Crimes Working Group would distribute, on an ongoing basis,
      information regarding promising practices that are occurring out in the field to address the


                                               4
        problem of hate crimes.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
       Assignment of New Hate Crime Resources. You may announce that the
        Administration will assign new resources for hate crimes enforcement. The
        Administration will assign significant additional FBI agents and prosecutors to hate crime
        cases. In addition, the Administration plans to create a Civil Rights Analytical Center at
        the FBI.

         Encourage hate crimes training for law enforcement. You can announce the
          development of a model law enforcement training curricula on hate crimes which can be
          incorporated into programs at local and state law enforcement training centers. This
          curriculum includes three course segments -- one segment directed to law enforcement
          officers, one segment to investigators, and one general segment for others in the law
          enforcement field. This curriculum would be available within 60 days for
        . implementation at law enforcement training facilities across the country.


III..   STATISTICS REGARDING HATE CRIMES


       Adding Hate Crime Questions to the National Crime Victimization Survey
        ("NCVS").. The NCVS is an annual survey conducted by the Department of Justice's
        Bureau of Justice Statistics to measure levels of crime through a national sampling of
        victims of crime. At present, it does not include questions about hate crime. Beginning
        in January of 1998, the Department of Justice will include questions related to hate crime
        as part of its annual survey of victims of personal crimes and vandalism. The survey will
        inquire whether the victim believes the incident was bias-motivated and why. In
        addition, the Department of Justice will be conducting extended versions of the NCVS in
        eleven cities across the country from January through April of next year, including
        expanded questioning regarding hate crimes.

IV.     EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES

       Teacher's resource guide for hate crimes awareness and Hate Crimes Internet Site.
        You can announce the development of a manual for educators on preventing youth hate
        crime. The Department of Justice and the Department of Education have drafted a guide
        for teachers that encourages schools and school districts to confront hate-motivated
        behavior among students; promotes development of comprehensive, progranunatic
        responses to prejudice and violence; and provides educators with various resources to
        undertake such responses. You can announce that the Attorney General and the
        Secretary of Education will send a copy of the manual to each of the country's 16,000
        school districts by December 1. You can also announce the availability of a website,
        "Hateful Acts Hurt Kids," linked to the Department of Justice website. This site will
