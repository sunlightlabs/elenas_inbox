         SYLVIA MATHEWS

DATE:          MARCH 13, 1998

SUBJECT:       PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE ON RACE WEEKLY REPORT
               MARCH 7 - MARCH 13



ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

        Association of Professional Journalists. On March 12, Governor Winter spoke to the
        Indianapolis Chapter of the Association of Professional Journalists about the Initiative.

        Tony Brown's Journal. On March 7, Reverend Suzan Johnson Cook was a guest on
        Tony Brown's Journal, a nationally syndicated talk show. The topic of the show was
        race relations in America and the President's Initiative on Race. Reverend Cook
        discussed the positive effect the Initiative is having across the country.

        Department of Energy. On March 3, Reverend Suzan Johnson Cook was the keynote
        speaker at the Department of Energy's Black History Month Forum. Reverend Cook and
        Secretary Pena spoke to 200 employees of the Department about the importance of their
        involvement in the work of the Initiative.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

        Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR). On March 13, Dr. John Hope
        Franklin, Initiative staff, and White House staff, including Erskine Bowles, Gene
        Sperling, and Bruce Reed met with the Executive Committee of LCCR. OMB
        Director Franklin Raines also participated in the meeting. We discussed the goals
        and future activities of the Initiative, policy initiatives of the Administration, and
        how LCCR could work with us to further the Initiative.

      COOL Conference. On March 13, we met with approximately 2,000 student leaders
      from 700 colleges and universities across America at the Campus Outreach Opportunity
      League (COOL) Conference at the University of South Carolina. We also participated in
      a town hall meeting for an additional 600 students focused on the theme "Young
      America's Participation in One America." We spoke to the students about the Campus
      Week톙f Dialogue and secured their commitments to participate in this event.

      Pennsylvania Students. On March 13, we met with 40 members of the student
      government of Plum Senior High School (Plum, PA), who responded to your Call to
      Action to student leaders and persuaded their school, school district and town to declare
      May I st, "Youth Action for Diversity" Day. They have sent a letter to the 494 school
      districts in the State describing their activities and encouraging all of the school districts
      to join their efforts.

      March Advisory Board Meeting. The next meeting of the Advisory Board, on
      March 23 - 24, in Denver, is focusing on causes, effects, and strategies for combating
      race and stereotypes. It will include a citizen dialogue on race on March 23,
      consisting of a moderated discussion with the Advisory Board and 20 - 25 local
      residents. An expert panel will continue the discussion on March 24.

      Campus Week of Dialogue. The theme of the Campus Week of Dialogue (April 6 -
      9) is "Who Will Build One America?" We believe the theme evokes the notions of
      community, personal responsibility, and opportunity. The response to outreach
      efforts has been very encouraging. The highlight event of the week will be a Town
      Hall meeting at Drew University on April 8 hosted by Governor Kean, who will be
      joined by Angela Oh and Secretary Richard Riley.

      Press Article. Attached is an article of interest about the Initiative, published recently in
      Turning Point magazine, which is a progressive, California-based magazine geared
      towards African American professionals.

FEDERAL AGENCY ACTIVITIES

Department of Justice

     Internet Hate Crimes: In one of the first known prosecutions for sending electronic
      hate mail by computer, a defendant was found guilty of transmitting hostile and
      threatening e-mails to approximately 60 students with Asian surnames at the University
      of California in Irvine, CA. In his e-mails, the defendant declared his hatred of Asians,
      accused them of being responsible for all campus crimes, and threatened to make it his
      "life career" to "find, hunt down, and kill" these individuals if they did not leave the
      University.

Department of Interior

    . Santee Sioux Tribe Casino: The Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska asked the U.S.
       Attorney General to sue the State. The tribe, which operates a small casino operation on
       its reservation, wants Nebraska to agree to a compact giving the tribe clear authority to
       run the casino. State officials say the casino is illegal because the tribe lacks an
       operating agreement with the State. Governor Nelson said Nebraska would not permit
       casino gambling on the tribe's reservation because that form of gambling is not allowed
       elsewhere in the State.

Department of Agriculture

     Civil Rights Initiative: On March 9, the Administration submitted a supplemental
      appropriations request that included funding to boost USDA's lending programs by $75
      million. Without the increase, some of USDA's key loan programs will run out of
      money, leaving an estimated 1000 farmers, many of whom are small and minority
      farmers, without credit this year.

     Farm Bill: On March 11, USDA formally transmitted to Congress a proposed bill that
      will replace the lifetime ban in the 1996 farm bill that prevents farmers who have
      received a loan write down from USDA from receiving new loans with a provision
      ensuring that creditworthy applicants receive a second chance at USDA assistance. Tbis
      problem attracted attention during the President's meeting with small and minority
      farmers in December, 1997.

Department of Health and Human Services

     Children's Health 1996: On March 9, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research
      (AHCPR) released a new sourcebook on data about children's health. The data in
      Children's Health 1996 highlights findings from AHCPR's 1996 Medical Expenditure
      Panel Survey (MEPS). Significant findings on children's health included in the
      chartbook are:

      ~      Hispanic children are more likely than black or white children to be uninsured
             (27.7 percent of Hispanic children, compared with 17.6 percent of black children,
             and 12.3 percent of white children).

             Hispanic children are more likely than black or white children to be in fair or poor
             health (7.8 percent of Hispanic children, compared with 4.2 percent of black .
             children and 2.9 percent of white children).

     Health Summit and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Meeting: On


                                              3
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion



      March 16-18, the Health Resources and Services Administration is sponsoring a
      conference to enhance collaboration with AAPI communities and improve primary health
      care delivery and infrastructure development in the six U.S.-associated Pacific Island
      jurisdictions.

     National Hispanic Medical Association Conference: On March 22, Substance Abuse
      and Mental Health Services Administration Administrator Chavez will deliver a panel
      presentation on HHS's Hispanic Agenda for Action, as part of the National Hispanic
      Medical Association's conference on Hispanic health care in Washington, DC.

Department of Housing and Urban Development

     "Homeowners hip Gap": On March 10, Secretary Cuomo announced that HUD
      will investigate the problem of mortgage lending discrimination in America's cities,
      in amove to increase urban and minority homeownership. The announcement
      follows last week's highest settlement on record of mortgage discrimination
      allegations under the Fair Housing Act. HUD helped negotiate the settlement with
      three lenders, who agreed to make nearly $1.4 billion in home mortgage loans and
      spend $6 million on a broad range of programs to increase homeownership by low- '
      and moderate-income families and minorities over the next three years.                   c


     Lending Discrimination: HUD will closely monitor complaints of lending
      discrimination and use testing to ferret out unlawful practices that treat white
      applicants and minority applicants differently. HUD will also issue a report later
      this year on the extent of mortgage lending discrimination, after completing its
      study of the problem around the nation.

Department of Transportation

     Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE): After a year's preparation by DOT, the
      Senate last week voted directly (58-37) to continue the long-standing national 10
      percent goal for award of highway-transit construction contracts to minority-and
      women-owned businesses. Inclusion of the same goal for transit funding is the next
      step in the Senate. The goal is already included for both highway and transit funds
      in the House committee bill (H.R. 2400). This was the first floor vote in the 105th
      Congress on the Administration's "mend it, don't end it" approach to the 1995
      Adarand v. Pena affirmative action Supreme Court decision.

Department of Education

     Hispanic Education: On March 18, the White House Initiative on Educational
      Excellence for Hispanic Americans will convene the first meeting of the
      Inter-Departmental Council for Hispanic Educational Improvement. The Council


                                             4

                                                          Automated Records Management System
           will develop                                   Hex텱ump Conversion

           working groups on education and employment that will be staffed by selected
           personnel from federal agencies. Representative Becerra will participate in the
           event.

          Hate Crimes Manual: Secretary Riley is scheduled to join Attorney General Reno
           for the March 26 release of the manual on hate crimes in schools that the President
           requested from DOEd and DOJ.

     Department of Veterans Affairs

          HBCU Dinner: On March 25, Acting Secretary West will address the 22nd
           Annual Historically Black Colleges and Universities President's Dinner at Alcorn
           State University, MS.

     Office of Personnel Management

          Congressional Black Caucus: On March 17, Director Lachance will meet with
           Representatives Becerra and Rodriguez, Members of the Congressional Hispanic
           Caucus, to discuss OPM's Nine Point Plan to address the under representation of
           Hispanics in the Federal Workforce.

          Diversity in the Workforce: On March 4, Director Lachance taught classes and
           made campus visits at the University of Southern California and California State
           Los Angeles. At both campuses, she amplified State of the Union, budget and
           reinvention themes, as well as discussed diversity in the federal workforce and the
           Administration's success in creating a workforce that reflects the nation's diversity.


          Race Roundtable: On March 4, Director Lachance held a One America roundtable
           at the Congregational Church of Christian Fellowship in Los Angeles, CA.

     General Services Administration

          One America: Administrator Barram has participated in three discussions on race
           with a diverse group of employees. In addition, he has involved his senior
           management in a discussion and has encouraged them to start their own discussions.
            Several groups of top and middle managers have participated in discussions and
           are spreading the concept to the regions. So far the feedback has been very
           positive.
