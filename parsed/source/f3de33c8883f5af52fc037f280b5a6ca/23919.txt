    H.R.     .. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related
                             Agencies Appropriations Act, FY 2000
                               (Sponsor: Skeen (R) New Mexico

       The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's views on the Agriculture,
Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill,
FY 2000, as reported by the House Committee. As the House develops its version of the bill,
your consideration of the Administration's views would be appreciated.

       The allocation of discretionary resources available to the House under the Congressional
Budget Resolution is simply inadequate to make the necessary investments that our citizens need
and expect. The President's FY 2000 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending that
meets such needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
proposals in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending. Congress
has approved and the President has signed into law nearly $15 billion of such offsets in
appropriations legislation since 1995. The Administration urges the Congress to consider such
proposals.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to accommodate certain of the
President's priorities within the 302(b) allocation. However, the Committee bill is nearly $600
million, or four percent, below the program level requested by the President. The FY 2000
Budget would increase spending within the discretionary caps for agriculture and other programs
in the bill by 3.6 percent over comparable FY 1999 spending. We urge the House to consider
the over $600 million in user fees proposed in the budget in order to fund high-priority programs.
 Given the current period of financial stress in the agricultural sector, now is not the time to
reduce assistance to farmers, ranchers, and rural residents.

       Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the Committee bill. We look forward
to working with you to resolve these concerns as the bill moves forward.

Food Safety Initiative

         The Administration appreciates the Committee's s~pport for the President's Food Safety
Initiative through increases provided in the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). However we are concerned that the Committee has provided only
$35 million of the $62 million increase over FY 1999 levels requested in this bill for the
Initiative. American consumers enjoy the world's safest food supply, but still too many
Americans get sick, and in some cases die, from preventable food-borne diseases. The
President's requested increase would provide critical resources to expand USDA's food safety
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

research and risk assessment capabilities. We strongly urge the House to provide full funding at
the requested levels for these activities.

Women, Infants, and Children Program

          The Committee bill would provide $4 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition
  Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), $100 million below the President's request of
  $4.1 billion. The Committee's mark would support a participation level of7.3 million women,
  infants and children. Based on FY 1999 year-end projections, this would mean cutting over
  100,000 needy participants offthe program. The President's FY 2000 Budget would support an
. average monthly participation level of7.5 million, fulfilling the bipartisan commitment to fully
  fund WIC. The Administration strongly urges the House to fund WIC at the President's
  requested level.

Food and Drug Administration

        While the Administration is very pleased that the Committee has provided the largest
single-year budget increase in the history of the FDA, we are disappointed that the Committee
has not funded the full amount for tobacco programs and the seafood inspection program
transfer.

             The Administration is committed to Youth Tobacco Prevention activities and urges
             the House to provide the requested increase of $34 million for these programs.
             Every day, three thousand young people become regular smokers. Reducing young
             people's tobacco use would improve public health for generations to come. This is
             particularly important in light of the recent decision of the conferees on the
             Emergency Supplemental to permit states to retain the entire amount secured from
             tobacco companies without any commitment whatsoever from the states that those
             funds be used to reduce youth smoking.

             The Administration urges the House to approve the proposal to consolidate Federal
             seafood inspection activities. The House is encouraged to fully fund the requested
             $3 million for training, education, and other costs associated with the program's
             transfer.

 Common Computing Environment

        The Administration is extremely concerned by the Committee's failure to fund the
Common Computing Environment. Some in Congress have criticized the Department of
Agriculture (USDA) this year for delays in providing the crop loss assistance funds to farmers
that were provided in P. L. 105-277, the FY 1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency
Supplemental Appropriations Act. Yet this bill would not provide the funds needed to address
the very problems that have contributed to the delay. At a time when the farm community is
under financial stress and the demand for farm credit and other programs is soaring, the need for
timely and efficient service to producers and rural residents has never been greater. Without the


                                                2
                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

proposed $74 million in funding, progress to modemize the technology in USDA's local field
offices, create "one-stop shopping" for rural customers, and promptly deliver the programs that
Congress enacts with available staffing levels will not be possible.

Conservation

        The Committee bill would cut spending on key USDA conservation programs by over
$200 million from the President's request. The $26 million reduction in the Environmental
Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) would mean 13,000 farmers and ranchers not receiving
needed financial and technical assistance to stop soil erosion, improve waste treatment in animal
feeding operations, and implement other voluntary conservation measures critical to protecting
our natural resources. To further advance this important work, including addressing the
significant backlog of fanners' requests for aid, the Administration requested a $100 million
increase in the EQIP program.

Lands Legacy Initiative

        The Committee has failed to fund the $78 million request for the Fannland Protection
Program, which is part of the Administration's Lands Legacy Initiative. USDA needs these
funds to help keep fanners on their land by pennanently protecting 130,000 acres of prime
fannland from development through easement purchases. We urge the House to provide the $50 .
million in discretionary funds requested for the program and to redirect savings from the
Conservation Fann Option to this program, as well as to the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program
to assist over 3,000 fanners in protecting and restoring wildlife habitat.

Environment

        Several valuable environmental programs would be severely underfunded by the
Committee bill, and we urge the House to restore funding for them. For example, the bill would
limit enrollment in the Wetlands Reserve Program to 120,000 acres, 80,000 acres less than
assumed in the budget. This limitation would mean that over 400 fanners would not receive
assistance they desire to restore and protect high-value wetlands on their property. In addition,
the Committee has not provided $12 million requested within the Conservation Operations
program, which would be used to assess soil management's effects on carbon sequestration, and
$5 million for USDA's initiative to help communities make use of geospatial data to make more
infonned land use decisions and promote smart growth.

Outreach For Socially Disadvantaged Fanners

       The Committee bill does not provide the requested $7 million increase for the Outreach
for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers program. This program has proven effective in mitigating
the decline in the number of minority fanners by increasing their participation in agricultural
programs, assisting them in marketing and production, and improving the profitability of their
fanning operations. USDA loan default rates have also improved in areas where this program
operates. The requested increase is needed to expand this program beyond the limited areas it


                                                3
                               Hex-Dump Conversion

now operates, to further these fanners' equal access and opportunity for success, and to continue
USDA's work to improve its civil rights performance.




Rural Development

        The Administration appreciates the increases provided for various rural development
programs, such as for single-family housing loans and water and wastewater loans and grants.
However, several priority programs have been underfunded, which would have a severe impact
on low-income rural residents and on progress in diversitying the rural economy. For example,
the $57 million reduction in the Rental Assistance Program would mean that over 1,300 expiring
rental assistance contracts would not be renewed. This would leave over 1,300 very-low and
low-income residents, most of whom are elderly women or single mothers, facing a very difficult
search for affordable shelter. In addition, no funds are provided for rental assistance in
newly-constructed farm labor and other rental housing, which would dramatically diminish the
ability of newly constructed units to target those most in need of housing.

       The Committee bill would also slash guaranteed loans under the Business and Industry
program from the enacted and requested guarantee level of $1 billion to $482 million, resulting
in 20,000 fewer jobs created or saved in rural America through the program. In addition, the
Committee has blocked spending from the Fund for Rural America, which would cause further
reductions in high-priority rural development and research projects.

Agricultural Research

        The Administration objects to the deep cuts in competitive research grants and the large
number of earmarked, lower-priority research projects funded by the bill. The Committee bill
would reduce competitive grants funded through the National Research Initiative by $14 million
from the FY 1999 enacted level and by $95 million from the request. When coupled with the
Committee's elimination of the $120 million in mandatory research funding and other
competitive grant funding, the bill would reduce competitive research grants by over $275
million, or 66 percent, from the requested level. These programs fund much of the most
important research needed to keep American agriculture competitive into the 21 st century and to
improve the quality of life for all Americans, such as research on food safety, new uses for
agricultural products, developing new markets for agricultural trade, and improving the
environment through efforts such as finding alternatives to methyl bromide. We urge the House
to increase funds for competitive research and to reduce earmarks for lower-priority programs.

Kyoto Protocol

        The Committee has included a general provision that would prevent funds provided in the
bill from being used to implement the Kyoto Protocol that was adopted in December 1997. As
the Administration has no intention of implementing the protocol prior to ratification, we believe
this language is unnecessary.

                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
Food and Nutrition Service Research/Other

        The Administration strongly objects to the provision of the Committee bill that would
provide funding for research on nutrition programs only within the Economic Research Service.
To address program integrity and performance issues properly, it is crucial that research on
nutrition programs also occur in the context of the program's administration. We urge the
House to provide funding for these activities within the Food and Nutrition Service.

       The Administration also objects to the Committee not including the President's request to
provide funding for the school breakfast demonstration programs and for Nutrition Education
and Training.

       We urge the House to approve the collection of$17 million in additive user fees targeted
to support the FDA's Pre-market Application Review efforts for new medical devices, food and
color additives, and food contact substances. The proposed user fees would allow the FDA to
work with its ~egulated industries to reduce total product development time and meet statutory
review requirements. Delays in getting new products to the market can postpone new
technologies that have the potential to save lives and save billions of dollars in health care costs.
The Administration would like to work with Congress to make this proposal a reality.

Language Issues

        The Administration objects to section 723 of the bill, which represents an infringement
on Executive authority. The provision would require Congressional approval before Executive
Branch execution. The Administration will interpret this and other such provisions to require
notification only, since any other interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in
INS vs. Chada.

        Section 733 of the bill would effectively require the President to provide legislative
guidance to Congress by identifying the legislation he would propose if a given recommendation
were not accepted. Such a requirement that the President spell out for Congress his fallback
position in the budget negotiation process conflicts with the Constitution's separation of
executive and legislative powers, and specifically with the President's constitutional authority to
recommend to Congress legislation that he deems appropriate.
