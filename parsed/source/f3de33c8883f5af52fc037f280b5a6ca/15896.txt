The Honorable William Roth, Jr.
Chairman
Committee on Finance
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman,

       As you know, the Administration and the bipartisan congressional leadership recently
reached agreement on a historic plan to balance the budget by 2002 while investing in the future.
 The plan is good for America, its people, and its future, and we are committed to working with
Congress to see it enacted.

       With regard to welfare, the budget agreement called for restoring Supplemental Security
Income (SSI) and Medicaid benefits for immigrants who are disabled or become disabled and
who entered the country before August 23, 1996 and making other important changes. The
Senate Finance Committee mark for inclusion in the FY 1998 budget reconciliation bill is,
however, inconsistent with the budget agreement in this key area. Consequently, if the
Committee were to proceed with its legislation in this form, we would be compelled to invoke
the provisions of the agreement that call on the Administration and the bipartisan leadership to
undertake remedial efforts to ensure that reconciliation legislation is consistent with the
agreement.

         We appreciate the fact that the Committee includes several provisions that were part of
the budget agreement that the Administration supports, such as in the areas of refugee and asylee
eligibility, welfare to work, and EITC compliance.

        Refugee and Asylee Eligibility -- The budget agreement would extend the exemption
period from five to seven years for refugees, asylees, and those who are not deported because
they would likely face persecution back home. The Administration supports the Committee's
mark which implements this policy and also extends the exemption to Cuban and Haitian
entrants.

        Welfare to Work -- We are pleased that the Chainnan's mark includes a number of
provisions that address the Administration's priorities, including: providing fonnula grant funds
to States based on poverty, unemployment, and adult welfare recipients; a sub-state allocation
of the fonnula grant that appears similar to the fonnula passed by two House Committees, to
ensure targeting on areas of greatest need; gives grantees appropriate flexibility to use the funds

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
unsubsidized jobs; awards some funds on a competitive basis; and creates a performance fund to
reward States that are successful in placing long-term welfare recipients. We look forward to
working with the Committee to refine these concepts. However, a number of other provisions,
discussed below; raise serious concerns.

       Earned Income Tax Credit - The Chairman's mark includes three proposals made by
Treasury to improve EITC compliance. The mark would deny EITC for ten years for those who
fraudulently claim the EITC; would toughen recertification requirements for those denied the
EITC as a result of deficiency procedures; and would impose due diligence requirements for paid
preparers. Treasury has proposed three other legislative compliance measures which we hope
the Committee wiIl also consider.

        With regard to benefits for immigrants, however, we have serious concerns that the mark
does not reflect the budget agreement. The Administration has separately transmitted draft
legislative language on June 4th that reflects the budget agreement's provisions on benefits to
immigrants.

        Continued SSI and Medicaid Benefits for Legal Immigrants -- The Administration
strongly opposes the provision that denies coverage to many legal immigrants who were in the
United States when the welfare law was signed but who become severely disabled after that date.
 The budget agreement explicitly states, "Restore SSI and Medicaid eligibility for all disabled
legal immigrants who are or become disabled and who enter the U.S. prior to August 23, 1996."
 The Committee mark fails to reflect that agreement by grandfathering those now receiving SSI
and only providing benefits for new applicants for only a very limited time. The Committee
mark will protect fewer people. A policy that only grandfathers immigrants who were on the
SSI rolls on August 22, 1996, protects 75,000 fewer immigrants than the budget agreement in the
year 2002.

        By contrast, the agreement targets the most vulnerable individuals by providing a safety
net for all immigrants in the country when the welfare law was signed who have suffered -- or
may suffer in the future -- a disabling accident or illness. In addition, the Administration
believes the budget agreement assumed that all legal immigrants currently receiving SSI benefits
would continue receiving benefits during the disability review, as has always been the practice.

         The Administration also urges the adoption of a provision to protect the benefits of those
who have been on the SSI rolls prior to 1979. Generally these are elderly citizens over the age
of 90 who do not possess the required birth certificates or other documents necessary to establish
eligibility. Finally, the Administration urges the adoption of a provision that would extend the
exemption period from five to seven years for Amerasian immigrants. Amerasian immigrants
share many of the problems and barriers of refugees and have the same level of need as refugees.



                                                              Automated Reccrds Management System
                                                 2                    Hex-Dump Conversion
Administration has the following serious concerns:

       Welfare-to-Work -- The following serious concerns are raised by the Chairman's Mark:

       Local Program Administration. The challenge of welfare reform -- moving welfare
       recipients into permanent, unsubsidized employment -- will be greatest in our Nation's
       large urban centers, especially those with the highest number of adults in poverty. Cities
       and other local areas have been entrusted by Congress with the responsibility for
       administration of other Federal job training funds. The Administration strongly believes
       that a substantial amount of all welfare-to-work funds should be managed by cities and
       other local areas which have the experience to address most effectively the challenge of
       moving long term welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized employment that reduces
       or eliminates dependency.

       The Mark, however, provides for local administration of formula grant funds only
       through the TANF agency. The Mark's competitive grant structure does not ensure that
       an appropriate portion of funds outside rural areas will be administered by cities with
       most adults in poverty. In addition, the competitive grant portion is only 25% of the total
       funds available, still further limiting the resources for cities with the greatest need.

       Close coordination of Welfare to Work activity with the State TANF agency and State
       TANF strategy is clearly essential. However, Welfare to Work would have a far greater
       likelihood of success for welfare recipients if it were primarily administered by cities and
       local areas. The Administration urges the Committee to incorporate provisions for
       management of Welfare to Work funds by cities and other local areas, as has been urged
       by Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Chairman Jeffords, and incorporated
       into Welfare to Work programs passed by two House committees. The Administration
       also urges that the formula and competitive funds each receive 50% of the total available,
       as is provided in the Ways and Means Committee approach.

       Federal Administering Agency. The Chairman's Mark would put the program under the
       Secretary of Health and Human Services. While consistency with Federal TANF
       strategies is essential, to be successful, the Welfare to Work program activities must be
       closely aligned with the workforce development system overseen by the Secretary of
       Labor. Thus, the Administration believes that the Secretary of Labor should administer
       this program. This is also the approach taken in the bills passed by the House Ways and
       Means and Education and Workforce Committees.

       Worker Protections. The Mark does not address worker protections. We believe the
       proposal should include adequate non-displacement provisions and worker protections
       addressing such issues as civil rights, unsafe workplaces, and hours. We therefore



                                                3            Aulomafed Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump ConvelSion
        1385, the House-passed job training reform bill.

·       Evaluation. We appreciate the inclusion of a substantial set-aside for evaluation by the
        Secretary of Health and Human Services; her leadership is appropriate in order to ensure
        the assessment of the impact of Welfare to Work in the context of overall T ANF policy.
        However, we believe it is equally important to have the Secretaries of Labor and Housing
        and Urban Development consulted on the evaluation's design and implementation, so that
        it may also take into proper account the relationship of Welfare to Work to other
        workforce development strategies and to urban policy.

·       Performance bonus. The Administration applauds the inclusion in the Mark of a
        performance bonus fund focused on increased earnings. However, it is essential that
        such bonuses be paid only in recognition of impacts over and above what is achieved by
        States with their T ANF and other funds. Welfare to Work resources should clearly lead
        to net additional positive outcomes for welfare recipients. In addition, the highest goal
        for Welfare to Work, and therefore for bonuses, should be the placement of the hardest to
        employ in lasting, unsubsidized jobs whose earnings are sufficient to reduce substantially,
        or eliminate, welfare dependency.

·       Distribution of funds by year. It does not appear that the Mark's allocation of $3 billion
        in budget authority across FY 1998-2000 will, when combined with the program
        structure, result in an outlay pattern consistent with an estimate of zero outlays in FY
        2002, provided in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement. The Department of Labor is
        available to work with the Committee to craft a BA distribution that does satisfY this
        outlay goal.

        Privatization of Welfare Programs. The Chairman's mark would allow the eligibility
and enrollment determination functions of federal and state health and human services benefits
programs -- including Medicaid, WIC, and Food Stamps -- in ten states to be privatized. While
certain program functions, such as computer systems, can currently be contracted out to private
entities, the certification of eligibility for benefits and related operations (such as obtaining and
verifYing information about income and other eligibility factors) should remain public functions.
 The Administration believes that changes to current law would not be in the best interest of
program beneficiaries and strongly opposes this provision.

        Unemployment Insurance Integrity -- The Committee mark does not include the
provision of the budget agreement that achieves $763 million in mandatory savings over five
years through an increase in discretionary spending of $89 million in 1998 and $467 million over
five years. These savings are a key component of the budget agreement. The discretionary
spending that the agreement assumes, and which would be subject to appropriation, would
support the necessary additional eligibility reviews, tax audits, and other integrity activities that,
the evidence demonstrates, will yield the savings. We urge the Committee to adopt this


                                                  4
                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
legislative language on June 6th that reflects the budget agreement's provisions on this provision.

         State SSI Administrative Fees -- It does not appear that the Committee intends to
include a provision, comparable to that included in the House Ways and Means Committee mark
and consistent with the budget agreement, to increase the administrative fees that the Federal
Government charges States for administering their State supplemental SSI payments and to make
the increase available, subject to appropriations, for Social Security Administration (SSA)
administrative expenses. The Administration encourages the Committee to do so.

       The budget agreement reflects compromise on many important and controversial issues,
and challenges the leaders on both sides of the aisle to achieve consensus under difficult
circumstances. We must do so on a bipartisan basis.

       I look forward to working with you to implement the historic budget agreement.

                                             Sincerely,
