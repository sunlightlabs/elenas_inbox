MEMORADDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed

RE:            Strategy Session on Children, Violence and Responsibility




       This memorandum will update you on our planning for the Strategy Session on Children,
Violence and Responsibility, scheduled for Monday, May 10. We are also proposing that you
personally make several telephone calls on Tuesday, May 4 to line up key participants.

        The purpose of the meeting is to lay the groundwork for a national campaign to reduce
youth violence, in the same way that we have been able to reduce drunk driving and teen
pregnancy and increase seatbelt use. The campaign will elicit and coordinate efforts from all
sectors of society, including the entertainment industry, gun manufacturers and gun control
advocates, educators, parents, and young people. The White House meeting on May 10 will be a
two-hour, closed-door, brainstorming session to discuss new and creative ways for all of us to
take responsibility -- by reducing youth exposure to gratuitous violence, increasing parental
involvement and supervision, and decreasing youth access to guns.

         While we may ultimately have to increase the size of the meeting, we are proposing
initially that the group be 23 in number, including yourself, the Vice President, Mrs. Clinton and
Mrs. Gore. The attached list of proposed participants includes a broad cross section of
representatives from the entertainment world, gun advocates and manufactures, online
communications and videos, education advocates and others. We would appreciate your
authorization to extend invitations in accordance with the attached list.

        Finally, we are enclosing call sheets and talking points so that you may extend invitations
to several key participants who we believe may require a personal invitation from you.
                                                                        Hex-DiJmp Conversion

Talking Points for Outreach Calls:
Strategy Session on Children, Violence and Responsibility


   I wanted to talk with you about the meeting we're having at the White House next Monday on
    Children, Violence, and Responsibility.

   Here's what I want to come out of this meeting: I think we ought to have a national campaign
    to reduce youth violence, in the same way that we have had campaigns to reduce drunk
    driving and teen pregnancy and increase seatbelt use. Those campaigns have been
    extraordinarily successful.
                                                                                      
   I'm not interested in pointing fingers or playing the blame game. I think the right response to
    the tragedy in Colorado is for all of us to make whatever positive contributions we can think
    of to prevent this from happening again. So I want to give everybody a chance to put forward
    new ideas -- not just the entertainment industry, but gun manufacturers, educators, parents,
    and young people. The White House meeting will be a two-hour, closed-door, brainstorming
    session to discuss new and creative ways for all of us to take responsibility -- by reducing
    youth exposure to gratuitous violence, increasing parental involvement and supervision, and
    decreasing youth access to guns.

   Your participation and ongoing contributions would mean a great deal to the success of this
    effort.

   What do you think we should do about this tragedy?
