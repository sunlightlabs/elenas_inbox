 FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

 DATE:      JUNE 3, 1997

 SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


 In order to avoid potential amendments in the Senate, the Budget
 Committees decided to file a Budget Resolution Conference Report.   The
 conferees [House Members: Kasich, Spratt, Hobson -- Senate Members:
 Domenici, Lautenberg, Faircloth) held a brief meeting as required and
 determined the following schedule:
         o Wednesday, the Conferees are expecting to file a Conference
 Report at 3:30pm and go to House Rules at 5:00pm;
         o Thursday, the Conference Report is expected to go to the House
 floor.


 One outstanding issue at the conference meeting was a discussion on
 whether the Conference Report will include 10-year costs of the tax cut.
 Senator Domenici suggested that it would not be included, but Mr. Spratt
 urged the conferees to include it. The issue is still open.

 Tomorrow, at 1:00pm, the conference on the FY 1997 Bosnia/Disaster
 Supplemental bill will resume and is expected to be completed. House and
 Senate votes on the Conference Report are expected on Thursday or perhaps
 Friday.

 Both the House and Senate expect to complete action on the Budget
 Resolution Conference Report and the Bosnia/Disaster Supplemental
 Conference Report this week.

 Deputy Director John Koskinen testified today before the Subcommittee on
 Government Management, Information, and Technology of the House Committee
 on Government Reform and Oversight regarding the status and assessment of
 agency implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act.

 On Wednesday at 4:00pm, the House Ways & Means Health Subcommittee will
 hold a Reconciliation Mark-up on Medicare Part A and Part B. The mark-up
 will go late into the evening Wednesday and will continue at 10:00am on
 Thursday.

 limiting the             10-year tax cut to $250 billion; and
