MEMORANDUM TO SALLY KATZEN

FROM:     Michael Fitzpatrick

SUBJECT:     SBREFA Requirements re Reagan Era Executive Orders


       In response to your request during our mid-June meeting regarding SBREFA's E.O.
analysis reporting requirements, members of our "E.O. Task Force" have reviewed the relevant
executive orders and prepared analyses on current compliance and how the Administration
should respond. A summary of their reviews and my recommendations follow.

       E.O_ 12606 -- Family

       Review (Jeremy Ben-AmiIDPC)

                    DPC believes the policies embodied in this E.O. are consistent with the
                     Administration's approach to family issues, and has no policy objections
                     to applying these criteria to regulatory review in the short term.

                    Following the events in November, minor adjustments to the policy
                     language might be appropriate.

                    Once we have determined how to handle this E.O., DPC believes we
                     should consider whether it should present a report to the President on this
                     subject.

      Discussion & Recommendations

                    Thus far, our "go slow" approach has allowed us to avoiding making a
                     hard decision on how to proceed. The House Government and Oversight
                     Committee (GRO) staff, however, continue to work with GAO to design
                     their monitoring process, which will no doubt include collection of
                     quantitative data on what percentage of the major/non-major rules have
                     complied with this E.O.'s certification requirement.

                    At some point, we likely will have to decide how to proceed, either
                     because the GAO data collectio!1 effort finally gets underway, or because
                                                             Au\oma eHex-Dump Conversion

             we do not want to appear to be avoiding the requirements of a bill we
             supported, particularly on a critical issue like the family.

            Because the policies in this E.O. are consistent with the Administration's,
             because we are hip-deep in an election, and because family values is a
             central issues in this campaign, rescinding the E.O. does not seem to be an
             option. These factors also cut against any sort of "Hey, but the
             ReaganlBush Administrations didn't comply either" response/defense.

            The best course is to have the agencies develop a process by which they
             can comply, with minimal burden, with the E.O. 's certification
             requirements. Thus, these rules will register as complying in GAO's data
             collection process. For the relatively few major rules that will be issued
             between now and November, agencies should spend additional time and
             effort in conducting a substantive review ofthe review under the E.O.
             SBREFA requires that GAO prepare an analysis of these major rules for
             Congress. OIRA staff can assist the agencies during OMB review.

              After November, we can return to the issue and determine whether to
      rescind, modify, or continue without change the E.O.

E.O. 12612 -- Federalism

Review (Elena Kagan/WH Counsel)

            Elena found less overlap than hoped between the Reagan Federalism E.O.
             (12612), and the President's Unfunded Mandates (12875) and Civil Justice
             Reforni (12988) E.O.s.

            The Civil Justice E.O. doesn't say much about preemption (it simply
             instructs agencies to be clear in their rules when they intend to preempt
             state and local law).

            While the Unfunded Mandates E.O. establishes a presumption against
             unfunded mandates and encourages regulatory waivers, the Reagan
             Federalism E.O. goes much further by:

                        instructing agencies to assess the justification and
                    constitutional basis for actions impinging on states;
                        requiring in such cases a clear statement of constitutional
                    authority and the necessity for national action;
                        establishing a presumption against uniform national standards
                    and deference toward state standards and policies; and
                        interpreting statutes not to preempt state law unless they do so
                    expressly.


                                                           Automated Records Management System
     Discussion & Recommendations                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

                At best, we can say that the Unfunded Mandates E.O. goes in the same
                 general direction as the Reagan E.O., but it would be a stretch (at a
                 minimum) to claim that it replaces the Reagan document.

                Elena and I concur that repealing the Reagan E.O. is probably not an
                 option at this time, for many of the same reasons expressed with regard to
                 the Family E.O. And as with the Family E.O., the GAO reporting process
                 and/or GRO will probably force our hand; we will have to take some
                 action. We believe that the best course of action is to explore ways in
                 which agencies can comply with the requirements with minimal burden.
                 Like the Family E.O., we can pay particular attention to the major rules
                 which will be subject to GAO analysis.

     E.O. 12630 - Takings

     Review (Linda Lance/OVP & Tom Jensen/CEQ)

                Linda and Tom have canvassed most of the relevant agencies (Army
                 Corps, DOl, EPA, and DOJ) and the good news is that it appears they are
                 making good faith efforts to comply with the E.O.'s requirements. Linda
                 has more detailed information on each of the four agencies, but the bottom
                 line is that the Army Corps appears to be the most active, having
                 completed 400-500 TIAs since the E.O. took effect. DOl and EPA have
                 done the fewest, about a half-dozen, but they have reviewed all their
                 regulatory actions to determine if a takings analysis is appropriate.

                All ofthe agencies have guidelines for implementing the E.O., which were
                 approved by the Bush Administration. The guidelines contain some
                 differences in their assessment of when TIAs are required.

                The bad news is that CBO has requested from DOl and Army Corps
                 copies ofTIAs as well as.the names and numbers offield attorneys who
                 prepare them. The purpose of the request is not yet clear.

     Discussion & Recommendations

                Tom, Linda, and I agree that rescinding the E.O. would not be appropriate
                 at this time, both because of the campaign and because agencies appear to
                 be complying with a minimum of burden.

                The far thornier issue is how to deal with the CBO request (which may not
                 be so sinister), and the anticipated requests from GAO (as SBREFA
                 appears to require that these TIAs be provided to GAO for every rule, and
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
                  nary a one has probably gone up, or is likely to unless agencies are so
                  instructed), or even McIntosh and Government Reform and Oversight
                  (probably sinister).

                 All those involved claim that the TIAs are protected by attorney-client
                  privilege and are exempt (exception 5) from FOIA. At least one court has
                  concurred on the privilege point. The problem, however, is that
                  attorney-client arguments won't work (in the end) with Congress. Nor
                  will FOIA exemption claims. And Bob Damus believes claims of
                  executive privilege or "deliberative process" may be difficult to defend.
                  My last conversation with Jack Quinn indicated he would agree with Bob
                  (Elena confirms that WH Counsel would be wary of using these defenses).

                 As a result, Tom, Linda, and I agree that the best course is to see if we, or
                  the agencies independently, can work with Congress to develop a middle
                  ground, where they could receive the data/information they require,
                  without undermining what up to now has been a candid, and useful,
                  takings analysis process.
