MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 BRUCE REED                                    Automated Records Management System

                      ROBERT SHIREMAN

SUBJECT:              Education Strategy


        You have proposed a popular, comprehensive education agenda to expand opportunity,
strengthen quality, and help prepare students, especially the most disadvantaged, to reach tough
academic standards and to enter college. These proposals build on your efforts since 1993 to
raise standards, strengthen accountability and expand flexibility, expand public school choice,
and improve the quality of schools by providing them with better prepared teachers and
up-to-date technology. .

        Some of your proposals, such as America Reads and the expansion of the 21 st Century
Schools program, stand a good chance of enactment. However, many, including class size
reduction, school modernization, and national tests, face a steep challenge in Congress, where the
majority's education priorities are expanding education IRAs, creating school vouchers, folding
existing programs into block grants, and doing relatively little else.

       In order to overcome Republican opposition and enact significant portions of your
education agenda, we propose a four-part strategy:

       (1) Build momentum by pressing for the proposals that are most likely to pass.

        (2) Make it costly for Republicans to oppose your new education initiatives -- school
modernization, education opportunity zones, class size -- by getting Democrats to bring them up
every time Republicans try to move a key piece of their education agenda (vouchers, Coverdell,
etc.)

       (3) Pursue a multi-pronged approach to national standards and tests.

       (4) Conduct a national education campaign to keep your entire education agenda visible
and use the bully pulpit to promote education reform.



                                                1
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

I. Building momentum by pressing for the proposals that are most likely to pass with
bipartisan support.
       Several pieces of education legislation reflecting your priorities stand good to excellent
chances of enactment with bipartisan support. Three of these (America Reads, OJ. Bill, and the
Higher Education Act) have July I deadlines for enacting necessary authorizations or changes.

         A. America Reads. The House has already passed its version, known as the Reading
Excellence Act, which provides funds to States to improve reading efforts in needy local schools
through teacher training (in research-based methods), tutoring, and family literacy. Sen. Jeffords
has pledged to move a similar piece of legislation in the Senate, though no action is yet
scheduled. We are working to meet a July 1 deadline imposed by the FY 1998 Appropriations
bill for triggering $210 million advance-appropriated for these purposes (for FY 99), and believe
the deadline can be met if we push. The House bill has some problems but ultimately would be
acceptable, and we expect that the Senate bill will be an improvement.

        B. Charter Schools. Last session the House passed H.R. 2616 by a strong bipartisan
vote (367-57). This bill, introduced by Reps. Riggs and Roemer and endorsed by you would
modify the existing federal Charter Schools Program by (1) steering more federal charter school
funding to states that provide charter schools with the maximum flexibility and strongest
accountability for results, and to states that have not reached a cap on the number of charter
schools permitted by that state's charter schools law, and (2) encouraging states to direct an
appropriate level of other federal education resources that pass through states to charter schools.
Sen. Lieberman and Sen. Coats have proposed similar legislation in the Senate, and the Senate
Labor Committee has scheduled a hearing for March 31. The prospects are good for enacting a
charter schools bill this year, though Sen. Kennedy is not eager to move a charter schools bill,
and controversial issues (e.g., whether to steer federal funds to states that allow entities other
than state or local school boards to authorize and oversee charter schools) still need to be
resolved.

         C. 'Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (including your mentoring and
teacher recruitment proposals, and the student loan interest rate fix). Both the House and
Senate Committees are scheduled to take up the Higher Education Act in the next few weeks,
aiming for floor action by May and a conference in June. In addition to reauthorizing the main
student aid programs, this bill would include your mentoring and teacher recruitment proposals.
It also needs to include a change in the new student loan interest rate scheduled to go into effect
on July 1. (There is a chance that the Congress will separate out this most pressing component
of the bill. If that happens, the pressure to move the overall bill will subside considerably, and
the chances of having a comprehensive higher education bill to sign before Congress adjourns
will be significantly reduced.)

       D. Job TrainingIVocational Education. The House passed both ajob training
consolidation bill and a Vocational Education reauthorization bill last year. The Senate has


                                                 2
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

combined the two, and may act as soon as next week on that package. While there are many
issues that need to be addressed in conference, we are optimistic that a bill can be finalized by
July 1, the deadline for authorizing the Opportunity Areas for Out-of-School Youth program in
order to receive advance-appropriations of $250 million.

       E. After-School Initiative. Your proposed expansion of the 21st Century Community
Learning Center Program is quite popular and is very likely to gain the necessary support in the
appropriations process. While there is some additional work to ensure that Sen. Jeffords, who
authored the program initially, remains supportive, our primary effort for this initiative should be
to ensure that your continued association with it as it proceeds through the appropriations process

        F. Technology Initiatives. While we do not yet know whatthe congressional
response will be to the set-aside and new funding for teacher training, we expect Congress will
continue to support your requests for funding education technology programs, including the
Technology Literacy Challenge Fund. So we can expect victories in this area, and should make
sure that we get appropriate credit and use that momentum.

II. Picking Key Fights to Highlight Your Initiatives.

       There are three issues that provide excellent opportunities to highlight your agenda and
contrast it favorably with Republican proposals. These are also issues where you can unite
Democrats and, if necessary, gain leverage with a veto threat and, in the Senate, a filibuster.

        A. School Modernization: Coverdell's education IRAs are expected to be voted on in
the Senate during the week of March 16. In consultation with Secretary Riley, Sen. Daschle has
agreed to bring your school construction proposal to the floor as a substitute, setting up a battle
between school construction and IRAs. We expect to be able to hold almost all Democrats (with
exception of Lieberman and Torricelli), and there is a chance of gaining some Republican
support as well. (We do not know yet if the Democrats will be able to sustain a filibuster of
Coverdell if the substitute fails.) The education groups are working to mobilize grass roots
support in favor of the construction initiative. While the odds are against winning this battle in
the short run, defining the issue visibly at the outset will enable you to keep hammering away at
this throughout the spring and summer.

        B. Education Opportunity Zones: We are working with Rep. Clay to finish education
opportunity zones legislation, and should schedule an event to announce it next month. Voucher
advocates are on their strongest rhetorical ground when they conjure up the image of a failing
urban school and use this image to suggest that public education is failing more broadly, and
argue that vouchers are needed to help save a few kids from a broken public education system.
Your Education Opportunity Zones initiative squarely addresses the real problems highlighted by
voucher advocates, but in a way that strengthens public schools and endeavors to help all
students, not just a few. It is based on the premise that we can and must fix failing school
systems and schools rather than abandoning them. It proposes to accomplish this with

                                                 3
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversicn

investments in accountability measures such as ending social promotions, intervening in failing
schools, rewarding outstanding teachers and removing incompetent ones. If Congressional
Republicans attempt to move a voucher proposal this year, this proposal is our best defense. In
the meantime, you can repeat your call for sweeping, Chicago-style reforms. One opportunity
will be to announce the first grant awards from the new Comprehensive School Reform program
(inculded in last year's appropriations bill by Reps. Obey and Porter), which provides funds for
implementing proven school wide reforms such as those developed by the New American
Schools Development Corporation.

         Co Class Size Reduction: The most popular element of your education agenda -- class
size -- is worth a separate, concerted rollout. We believe that next month you should speak to
the legislature in Delaware, where Governor Carper has proposed major class size reductions and
an end to social promotions. The Education Department is developing a series of reports and
other tools for you to announce (e.g., a summary of class size research, a white paper
documenting how smaller classes can led to better classroom practices, and state-by-state figures
on how many new teachers can be hired under your proposal). The elementary and secondary
education groups are able and eager to mobilize grass roots support. We may also have a chance
to press this issue during the budget resolution debate, much of which will concern whether
tobacco revenues can be used for child care and class size.

        The fate of these three initiatives is likely to be determined at the end ofthe session, as
work on tobacco legislation and tax and appropriations bills are hopefully completed. You will
have. the greatest leverage at that time, and should be in the best position to strike the most
favorable deals.


III. National standards and tests
        Progress on national tests requires action with respect to both authorization and
appropriations, and continued efforts to demonstrate that these tests are in fact national rather
than federal. Consequently, we are pursuing a strategy that moves forward on a number of
fronts simultaneously. These include:

        Use NAGB and ACHIEVE to change the political dynamics around the tests. Last
year's appropriations agreement placed NAGB in charge of the tests and commissioned the
National Academy of Sciences to study how existing state tests could be used to compare
students to national standards--an톋pproach which is technically complex but which could help
diffuse some opposition to a single national test. This study is due July 1, and is intended to
inform Congressional action on the tests. We are pursuing a number of strategies to capitalize
on these opportunities to alter the political dynamics around the tests.

       Lou Gerstner and Achieve are prepared to playa more active role in supporting national
standards and tests, in the context of Achieve's recently launched effort to help states compare
individual student performance across states to each other and to common standards. We are


                                                 4
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

 working to set up an opportunity, such as a conference call with Achieve's Board of Directors or
 a one-on-one meeting with Gerstner, in which you can praise Achieve's efforts and ask for a plan
 on how the federal government can support its work. Achieve would respond with a request to
 provide a common pool ofNAEP items that states could use in their own tests in order to
 J?easure students against NAEP performance standards. However, since this approach will be
 technically feasible only for state tests that are already quite similar to NAEP (a requirement only
 a few states can currently meet), Achieve would also recommend the continued development of a
 separate national test based on NAEP. Going along with these recommendations would signal
 our openness to using multiple tests while reinforcing our proposal to create a common test that
 all states could use voluntarily. They would give the business community a national testing
 proposal to unite comfortably behind, and make it easier for governors of both parties to support
 our efforts.

        We could also work quietly with Achieve to explore a way for it to take over the work of
 developing the tests, if it appeared that we could not sustain the necessary Congressional support
 forNAGB.

          NAGB has now taken complete hold of test development, and has conducted a number of
  Congressional briefings on its work. While Goodling remains almost as hostile to NAGB's
  efforts as he was to the Education Department's, early indications are that NAGB is making
  positive inroads among other Republicans. Last week NAGB revised somewhat and then
  approved the test specifications that had originally been developed under the Education
  Department's auspices. These specifications determine the content and difficulty of the test
. items. This was a crucial step, because NAGB members can now authoritatively take on
  criticisms from the far right that these tests are based on "fuzzy" math and will dumb down the
  curriculum. We have encouraged NAGB to continue its Congressional briefings on its work,
  and, have specifically encouraged Diane Ravitch to prepare an op-ed and take other steps that can
  get the message out more broadly.


        Encourage Democrats to propose specific authorization for national tests. Goodling
 has argued that we need specific Congressional authorization before national tests can be
 developed or administered. (As you recall, we have always maintained that we did not need new
 authorization, and we're using the same authority that Bus and Alexander used in proposing
 voluntary tests in 1991.) We expect Goodling to take up reauthorization of the National
 Assessment of Education Progress later this spring, and to include a specific prohibition on
 national tests in that bill. Last month, Goodling passed a bill prohibiting further work on the test
 on the House floor, though no Senate action is expected on this bill.

        To counter this, we are working with George Miller in the House, and Kennedy and
 Bingaman in the Senate, to propose their own legislation to authorize national testing, to be
 considered as part of the reauthorization of the National Assessment of Education Progress .. We
 would work with them on tl;1e details of the bill, but make sure the legislation was seen as theirs


                                                  5
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

  rather than ours. This would leave them free to cut whatever deals were needed in each body to
  build support for the legislation, and not require us to own whatever they came up with. It
  would also leave us free to. continue to argue that we already have sufficient authorization to
. proceed with test development, and to fight the testing battle on the appropriations bill.

          In the House, our first priority must be to hold Democrats together, in order to have a
 chance of peeling any Republicans away from Goodling. This will be difficult, because there is
 little support for testing from significant portions of the Black and Hispanic caucuses under any
 circumstances. To have a chance of holding the caucuses, Miller would almost definitely have to
 craft a proposal that includes a Spanish-language version of the reading test, a prohibition on use
 of the tests for high stakes purposes, protections against test bias, and detailed requirements for
 how the test results would be reported. The provisions that will unite Democrats are least likely
 to appeal to Republicans, so the more likely result is partisan polarization. Nonetheless, that
 may leave us better positioned than before to conduct a high profile fight with Republican
 opponents of the testing.

        The situation in the Senate remains more favorable than the House. There the task for
 Kennedy and Bingaman will be to craft a proposal that can hold as much Republican support as
 possible. While it is too early to determine the shape of such a proposal, last year's experience
 suggests that steps to strengthen NAGB and further guarantee its independence will be necessary.
  The Achieve recommendations are likely to playa role in shaping a Senate bill as well.

        The chances that this approach will lead to authorization bills that pass both houses is
 remote at best. However, these steps are necessary to hold and expand our support in both
 houses, to defend against efforts by Goodling and Ashcroft to ban further work on the test, and to
 remove Goodling's basis for drawing support on the procedural grounds that testing should not
 proceed without Congressional involvement.

          Pursue an appropriations strategy to enable work to continue on test development.
  The most important Congressional action regarding national tests will come in the appropriations
  bill, where we must fight to ward off any proposals to prohibit further work and to retain funding
  to enable continued development work. The steps outlined above will better position us for a
  replay of last year's battle, by better holding Democrats in the House and by taking away
  Goodling's charge that the authorizing committees have been cut out of the process .
. Nonetheless, it is likely that you will also have to threaten to veto any appropriations bill that
  ends funding for the test. This could pose a tough dilemma for the Republicans one month
  before the election.


 IV. Conducting a national education campaign.
        Because this could prove to be a worse-than-do-nothing Congress on education, it is
 worth a separate discussion on how to transform America's schools without help from
 Washington. The TIMSS roundtable on Monday is an opportunity to begin that discussion.


                                                  6
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

      We believe the bully pulpit can be effective, and a high-profile effort targeted at urban school
      districts might make a real difference, but the last two decades suggest it will be very difficult.
      Nevertheless, our legislative agenda and the standards movement can only benefit from a
      vigorous national campaign for education reform. The campaign should consist of events and
      actions in support of specific legislative proposals, events that promote your comprehensive
      education package, and events that promote state, local and business action for education reform
      regardless of Congressional action.

             Specific events we are planning include:

            The upcoming meeting with leaders from business, education and state and local
             government to focus public attention on the TIMSS results.

            An address to a state legislature to promote your overall education package with an
             emphasis on class size reduction. The Education Department is working on a White
             Paper on the benefits of class size reductions that could be released at this speech.

            A visit to an urban school district that illustrates key aspects of your Education
             Opportunity Zones proposal, such as ending social promotions, intervening in failing
             schools, removing incompetent teachers or rewarding teachers who achieve certification
             from the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards. This could be timed to
             accompany the transmittal or introduction of legislation, or the release of an Education
             Department report on turning around failing schools.

            An event with CEO's and governors on the ACHIEVE Board of Directors in support of
             national standards and tests.

            A meeting with mayors during a U.S. Conference of Mayors Conference on Public
             Schools, to be held in May.

            A roundtable discussion with business and education leaders about "making performance
             count" for students, by supporting a growing nationwide effort by employers to examine
             high school transcripts and other indicators of academic performance in the hiring
             process.

            A commencement address at a public high school, or charter school, to underscore your
             efforts to strengthen public education.

            A White House Conference on Strengthening Public Schools, to kick offback-to-school
             events in the Fall.

            The release of reports on school violence from the Education and Justice Departments

                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

      VPOTUS involvement in a series of forums and a Fall symposium on modernizing
       schools (school construction).

      The release of a report on Saving for College (to highlight our Higher Education Act
       proposal to stop punishing savings through the student aid formula).

      A comment or challenge in response to a report to be released next week by the National
       Academy of Sciences on effective practices for teaching reading. This could be an
       opportunity to reinforce the need for our reading initiative.

       Announce summer pilot sites participating in America Reads. Involve participants
        electronically from around the country. Also announce 1,000 colleges participating with
      . Work-Study students (end of March).

      Visit model High Hopes-type early intervention program, and/or attend announcement of

        Over the longer term, we could begin planning an event to mark the 10 year anniversary
of Charlottesville National Education Summit (September 1999) or the establishment of the
National Education Goals (February 2000). Governors, business leaders and many in the
education community are beginning to anticipate these anniversaries and think about how best to
use them to provide additional impetus for education reform. In light of your personal
leadership at the Charlottesville Summit and in the subsequent establishment of the Goals, it
would be natural for you to lead the effort to look back on what has been accomplished and to
lead the way to define the work ahead.
