OBJECTIVE

Objective of American Heritage Rivers Initiative. To protect and restore America's great
rivers to enhance our citizens' enjoyment of their historic, cultural, recreational, economic and
environmental value and the health of our communities.

CHARGE TO CABINET

President Clinton is charging his Cabinet to work with communities to design an initiative that
will support community efforts on behalf of their rivers. The Cabinet will report the results of
this effort with recommendations to the President within 90 days for his approval.

CORE ELEMENTS

      Matching Community Involvement with Federal Support. The American Heritage
       Rivers effort is a partnership between the federal government and the people who enjoy
       the many values ofa river. The partnerships will be created from the community up,
       through local, state, tribal, and federal governments rather than from the top down.

      Giving Communities the Tools They Need. President Clinton is directing federal
       agencies to provide better tools to all communities to enhance America's rivers and create
       greater opportunities for the people who live along them.

      "American Heritage Rivers." In addition, President Clinton will offer special
       recognition to outstanding stretches of America's rivers by selecting them to be
       "American Heritage Rivers." Communities will nominate sites to be considered for this
       status. Federal agencies will refocus resources to provide particular assistance to these
       areas.

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT

      A Call to Action. The President is calling on communities around the country to bring
       private companies, non-profit organizations, and state, local, and tribal resources together
       to restore, protect, and revitalize rivers that run through their communities. President
       Clinton is directing his Cabinet to reach out to those people to encourage and expand on
       successful efforts.

      Using Partnerships to Chart Each Community's Unique Course. The American
       Heritage Rivers initiative will center around partnerships between communities and state,
       local, tribal, and federal governments. Each river and every community is different, and
       chart a course that makes the most sense based on the area's economic, social, historical,
       and environmental conditions, drawing on local expertise already devoted to river and
       community enhancement.

TOOLS FOR ALL RIVER COMMUNITIES

The Cabinet will prepare recommendations for improving federal help to all river communities,
including but not limited to American Heritage Rivers. Examples of activities that the federal
government can undertake include the following:

      Access to Federal Programs and National Expertise. Communities need help
       penetrating the maze of federal programs available to assist them. Agencies will make it
       easier to access available federal resources to support community restoration, protection
       and revitalization efforts, and will create a clearinghouse for this information. This
       effort will also make national expertise available to communities and actively promote
       successful ideas about how our heritage can be preserved.

      Comprehensive Information for Communities. For the first time communities will
       have access to all the data available to the federal government about the health of their
       rivers and the challenges to continued protection. Agencies will make this information
       easily accessible using the Internet and other methods.

      A Talent Bank Across Communities. Many communities are already engaged in work
       to preserve their river and revitalize their communities. Federal agencies will create a
       "talent bank" of experienced local people who are willing to share knowledge and
       techniques about community river restoration efforts.

SELECTION OF "AMERICAN HERITAGE RIVERS"

      American Heritage Rivers. In addition to the better help provided to all톍ommuntities,
       the President will select outstanding river sites as American Heritage Rivers. In the first
       year up to ten such sites will be selected to demonstrate successful models of community
       action. Lessons learned from these sites will be shared across the country.

      Enhanced Government Tools. President Clinton is directing his Cabinet to refocus
       programs, grants, and technical assistance to provide special support to American
       Heritage Rivers. Each community supporting an American Heritage River will be given
       resources to catalyze their community'.s work on behalf of a restored, revitalized river.

      Better Decisions. President Clinton is directing the federal agencies to adopt a "good
       neighbor" policy in making decisions, taking into consideration the effects upon
       American Heritage Rivers of actions by federal agencies.

      Community Representative. Federal agencies will provide a community representative
                                                                              f :.;)(-LJunl~ CunVJ,SIJn

     to help implement the community's vision and provide a contact for federal resources in
     each American Heritage River community.

    Nominations. Communities will be able to nominate outstanding stretches of river for
     con~ideration as an American Heritage River. Nominations will include information on
     the importance of the stretch of river to the nation's culture and history; to past and future
     economic development; and to public health and environmental quality. In addition, the
     Administration will ask for a community plan for revitalization, broad support for the
     plan and a commitment of non-federal resources.

FULFILLING THE PRESIDENT'S CHARGE

    Directive to Cabinet. The President is directing the Cabinet (including agencies
     responsible for natural resource management, economic development, environmental
     protection, and historic preservation) to develop the American Heritage Rivers effort by
     reaching out to those with experience in revitalizing their communities and rivers -- civic
     leaders, businesses, government at all levels, historians, non-governmental organizations.
      Within 90 days the Cabinet will report to the President the design of a program that will
     carrY out the objectives of this initiative.

    American Heritage River Selections. As part of the design of the overall program, the
     Cabinet will recommend specific basic program procedures, including the process for
     nominating and selecting sites for American Heritage River recognition, and the
     considerations that will affect the selection. The President will select up to 10 American
     Heritage Rivers for recognition within one year from the announcement of the final
     program.

    Budget Impact. This effort is not to rely on net increases in federal spending or
     regulations, but rather newly-targeted budget resources and more effective regulation.
