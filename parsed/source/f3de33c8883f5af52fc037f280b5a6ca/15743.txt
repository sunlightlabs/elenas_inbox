                                    LEGAL IMMIGRANTS

The Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal fails to restore benefits for SSI beneficiaries
currently on the rolls whose sponsors have income over 150% of the poverty level.

      THE WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL WAS NOT PART OF
       THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET AGREEMENT. This proposal to severely limit the
       restoration of benefit to legal immigrants was not contemplated by the bipartisan budget
       agreement.

      THE WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSAL IS UNFAIR TO
       FAMILIES OF LIMITED MEANS. Under this proposal, a family of four with an
       income as low as $24,000 would be called upon to fully support a person with a severe
       disability.

      DISABLED LEGAL IMMIGRANTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CALL ON THEIR
       SPONSORS FOR HELP. More than half of disabled legal immigrants currently
       receiving have been in the U.S. for over 15 years, and so they may find it difficult even to
       locate their sponsors. Since sponsorship agreements were not legally binding in the past,
       a disabled legal immigrant whose sponsor refuses to provide support would have no legal
       recourse and no source of income.

55% APPROX HALF;

The Ways and Means Subcommittee's proposed amendments to the welfare law violate the
negotiated, bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a minimal safety net for disabled legal
immigrants.

      THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET AGREEMENT POLICY PROTECTS THE MOST
       VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS: The bipartisan budget agreement policy restores SSI
       and Medicaid eligibility for legal immigrants who are or become disabled and who
       entered the U.S. as of August 22,1996. This policy targets assistance to the most
       vulnerable individuals. The Ways and Means Subcommittee's proposal would restore
       SSI and Medicaid eligibility only to immigrants (both the disabled and non-disabled
       elderly) already receiving benefits prior to August 23, 1996.

      THE WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSED GRAND FATHERING
       POLICY IGNORES VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS WHO BECOME DISABLED
       AFTER AUGUST 22, 1996: This proposal abandons many legal immigrants who were
       in the U.S. when the welfare law was signed but become severely disabled after that date.
        In contrast, the bipartisan budget agreement protects those immigrants who may happen
       to fall victim to a disabling accident or illness.

       Example: A legal immigrant family entered the country 3 years ago. Both the father and
       mother have worked full-time since then, and have an annual income of about $25,000,
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

      but neither job provides health insurance for themselves or the family. Their 5 year-old
      son becomes severely disabled in a car accident next year. Under the budget agreement,
      he would be eligible for SSI and Medicaid; under the Ways and Means Subcommittee's
      proposal he would be denied SSI -- and potentially denied Medicaid. (I'his example
      assumes the parents would rapidly "spend-down" due to hospital bills and become
      income-eligible for SSI and Medicaid.)


Question:    Doesn't the Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal treat the elderly better than
             the Administration's proposal, while the Administration's policy favors the
             disabled?

Answer:      The bipartisan budget agreement would grandfather a significant portion of the
             current caseload -- about 80 percent. This includes all of the disabled as well as
             two-thirds of the current elderly caseload who are likely to meet the disability
             eligibility requirements required to retain coverage.

             Difficult decisions have already been made given the limited resources provided
             under the budget agreement. The budget agreement not only contains specific
             budget levels for restoration of benefits to immigrants, but also explicitly states
             the policy of restoring SSI and Medicaid eligibility to immigrants who are or
             become disabled and who are in the U.S. as of August 22, 1996. This is one of
             only a handful of specific policies that were agreed to between the President and
             the Congressional leadership. The Administration believes that the agreement
             appropriately targets the most vulnerable individuals.
