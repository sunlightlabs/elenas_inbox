PRESIDENT CLINTON'S EDUCATION AND TRAINING
          PRIORITIES FOR THE FALL
President Clinton is committed to helping prepare our students and our country for the 21 st
Century by enacting proposals to strengthen and invest in public education, expand access to
higher education, and provide those who need it with the training needed to succeed in the
workplace. The following list outlines President Clinton's education and training key priorities
for the remainder of this Congressional session:

1.        MODERNIZING OUR SCHOOLS. President Clinton is committed to ensuring that
          we help prepare all students for the future, by providing them with safe, modem school
          buildings, small classes and access to up-to-date technology.

                School Modernization Tax Credits. To help rebuild, modernize and build over
                 5,000 public schools, President Clinton will work with the Congress to pass Federal
                 tax credits to pay interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds at a cost of $5 billion over
                 five years.

                Reducing Class Size. President Clinton is committed to helping local schools
                 provide smaller classes with well-prepared teachers in the early grades. The
                 initiative would provide $12.4 billion over seven years to reduce class size in grades
                 1-3 to a nationwide average of 18 and help make sure that every child receives
                 personal attention, gets a solid foundation for further learning, and learns to read
                 independently and well by the end of third grade.

2.        EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY: PREPARING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. The
          Clinton Administration has made an unprecedented commitment to bringing technology
          into the classroom and to ensuring that all children are technologically literate by the dawn
          of the 21 st century. The House-passed appropriations bill cuts the President's request for
          educational technology by $180 million; for example, it eliminates $75 million for
          technology teacher training, which would help new teachers learn to use technology
          effectively to strengthen instruction and enhance student learning, and it cuts $50 million
          from the President's request for the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, which would
          deny funding to 400 school districts to provide students and teachers with access to
          classroom computers, training and the latest educational software and telecommunications
          technology. The President will also continue to strongly oppose any effort by the
          Congress to repeal or delay the "e-rate" -- an expansion of universal service to provide
          discounted Internet access and telecommunications services to schools and libraries.



                                                   1               Automated Records Management SYS\i;;ll1
                                                                   Hf'x-Dump Conversion
     AID, RECRUITING AND PREPARING GOOD TEACHERS, AND MENTORING
     MIDDLE-SCHOOL STUDENTS. Congress must pass the reauthorization of the Higher
     Education Act. Passed in different forms by both Houses, this bill would reduce interest
     rates on student loans, consistent with the Administration's proposal announced by the Vice
     President earlier this year. It will also extend the Pell Grant program, which provides
     billions of dollars in college aid for low income students, and the Federal Work-Study
     program, which helps students work their way through college.

           High Hopes Mentoring Initiative. President Clinton will also work to ensure
            that the Higher Education Act includes his High Hopes mentoring initiative, to
            inspire more of our young people to have high expectations, to stay in school, and
            to go to college.
           Teacher Preparation and Recruitment. The President will also work to ensure
            that the Higher Education Act includes his proposal to strengthen teacher training
            programs and provide scholarships to 35,000 well-prepared teachers who commit to
            teaching in underserved urban or rural schools. He will also work with Congress to
            include new proposals to strengthen accountability for teacher education programs.

4.   HELPING EVERY EIGHT-YEAR OLD LEARN TO READ. More than two years ago
     President Clinton proposed the America Reads program, to mobilize an army of tutors to
     help all children read independently and well by the end of the third grade. In the Balanced
     Budget Agreement, the Congress pledged to fund an early literacy initiative based on this
     proposal. It is time that Congress keeps its commitment. The literacy bill, now pending
     in Congress, would ensure that children receive quality instruction from well-trained
     teachers and have opportunities to practice and further develop their reading skills after
     school and on weekends with trained tutors. It would also ensure that families receive the
     support they need to help our youngest children develop necessary language and literacy
     skills from infancy so that when they get to school they are ready to learn to read.

           Expanding Head Start Helps Children Start on the Right Track. One of the
            reasons President Clinton is fighting to expand Head Start is so that our children start
            school ready to learn, which is an important first step to early literacy. The President
            will work to restore the $160 million House RepUblicans underinvest in Head Start --
            which would deny slots to 25,000 low-income children.

5.   STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING CHARTER SCHOOLS. President Clinton
     will work with Congress this fall to complete work on bipartisan legislation to strengthen
     federal support for the growing charter schools movement, to help meet his goal of
     establishing 3,000 high-quality charter schools by early in the next century. Last year, the
     House of Representatives passed a bill with bipartisan support to direct federal resources for
     charter schools to states that increase the number of charter schools, provide them with
     maximum flexibility, and periodically review their performance. The Administration has

                                                                     Automated Records Managemem ~.
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
     academic performance in charter schools and ensure that charter schools receive their fair
     share of other federal education funds. The President will call on Congress to send him
     legislation that meets these goals before the end of the session.

6.   STRENGTHENING PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION. President Clinton will work to
     restore $2 billion in Congressional cuts to his proposed investments to strengthen public
     schools, and expand access to higher education, and invest in preparing our youth to enter
     the workforce:

           Title I (Education for the Disadvantaged). The President wiIl fight the
            Republican efforts to cut $392 million in grants to high-poverty school districts,
            which would mean that 520,000 students in high-poverty communities would not get
            extra help to master the basics and meet high-academic standards.
            After-School Programs. The President will work to ensure that Congress fully
            funds his efforts to strengthen after-school programs. The House Republicans
            provide $140 million less than the President's request, which would deny about
            425,000 children access to safe learning centers.
           Expanding Head Start. President Clinton is committed to ensuring that children
            enter school ready to learn -- that is why he will continue to press Congress to fully
            fund his request for Head Start. The President will work to restore the $160 million
            House Republicans underinvest in Head Start -- which would deny slots to 25,000
            low-income children.
           Hispanic Education Action Plan: Because the education of Hispanic Americans
            requires special attention -- their high school drop-out rate, for example, is
            unacceptably high -- President Clinton is committed to ensuring that his $600 million
            Hispanic Education Action Plan is fully funded. This action plan provides for the
            increased investments necessary to help students master the basic skills (Title 1), and
            become proficient in English (Bilingual Education), help schools implement
            research-proven reforms to reduce drop-out rates (Comprehensive School Reform),
            help adults receive basic skills training and participate in
            English-as-a-second-Ianguage programs (Adult Education), and provide assistance to
            colleges and universities that serve large numbers of Hispanic students.
           Goals 2000. The President will fight Republican efforts to cut by $255 million
            (51 %) Goals 2000, reversing support for efforts to raise academic standards,
            affecting 6,000 schools serving over 3 million students.
           Education Opportunity Zones. The President will fight for his Education
            Opportunity Zones initiative, which would help high-poverty urban and rural
            communities increase student achievement by raising standards, improving teaching,
            ending social promotions, and turning around failing schools.
           Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities. The President will fight
            Republican efforts to cut Safe and Drug-Free Schools by $50 million, eliminating
            funding for School Coordinators to help fight drug and alcohol abuse and increase

                                              3                 Automated Records Management I>~ ~'''.
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion



                school safety.

    7.   EXPANDING INVESTMENTS IN YOUTH EDUCATION AND TRAINING. One
         of President Clinton's top priorities this fall is ensuring that Republicans do not eliminate
         the Summer Jobs Program -- which provides work experience to disadvantaged youth -- and
         the new Youth Opportunity Areas initiative -- which helps provide hope and opportunity to
         youth in high-poverty areas.

               Summer Jobs.     Up to 530,000 disadvantaged young people would be denied the
                opportunity to gain skills and valuable work experience over the summer months, if
                the House Republican budget plan passes. The President is absolutely committed to
                ensuring that all of the money for the summer jobs program is restored because
                studies show that the Summer Jobs initiative works: a 1995 report concluded that
                more than three out of four young people enrolled in the program would have been
                jobless without it.
               Youth Opportunity Areas. The House Republican budget does not fund the $250
                million requested in the President's FY 99 Budget and rescinds $250 million that
                was appropriated last year for this program. The President will fight to restore the full
                funding for this initiative because it will help provide job opportunities for up to
                50,000 youth in the poorest communities.
               School-to-Work. The President will work to ensure that House Republicans do not
                cut School-to-Work by $100 million, seriously hampering efforts in all States to help
                young people move from high school to careers or postsecondary training and
                education.
