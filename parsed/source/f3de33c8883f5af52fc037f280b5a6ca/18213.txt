                          1997 MONITORING THE FUTURE STUDY
                                 December 20, 1997

       A Glimmer of Hope. The 1997 Monitoring the Future (MTF) study shows that
        for most drugs and for most grades -- and for the first time since 1991 -- the
        increasing trends in teen drug use seem to be leveling off and, in some cases,
        even decreasing. Specifically, this year's MTF found:

              - Drug use stabilizing.     With one exception, there was no recorded
              statistically significant increase in 30-day drug use among 8th, 10th and
              12th graders;

              - 8th grade drug use declining.  For 8th graders, declines were
              recorded in past year use of any illicit drug, stimulants, tranquilizers, and
              daily use of marijuana.

              - Attitudes changing.There were important changes in attitudes
              regarding drug use. For instance, 8th graders were more likely to
              disapprove of occasional marijuana and cocaine use.

       Progress On Drug-Related Crime. Earlier this year, the Justice Department
        released studies showing that methamphetamine use declined between 7%
        and 52% in 8 key cities, and that the crack use was down substantially -- by at
        least 10% -- in 10 major cities. Drug-related murders also dropped to their
        lowest point in a decade.

       Much More Still Needs to be Done. Unfortunately, despite these signs of
        progress, drug use remains unacceptably high. Too many kids are still using
        drugs, and too many kids still do not understand the risks associated with
        them. Motivating kids to reject the use of illegal drugs must be our number
        one priority.

       Time to Redouble Our Efforts.MTF is the second national survey this year to
        show that we have an opportunity to begin reversing recent increases in
        adolescent drug use. That is why now, as teen drug use begins to level off
        and younger students show their disapproval, is the time to reach out to our
        kids.

       The President's Nation Anti-Drug youth Media Campaign.      Starting January
        5th, the Administration will launch an unprecedented $195 million paid media
        campaign that .uses the full force of the media --from prime time television to
        the Internet to sports marketing -- to educate kids and parents about the
        dangers of drugs. The campaign will begin with ads in 12 pilot -- Atlanta,
        Baltimore, Boise, Denver, Hartford, Houston, Milwaukee, Portland, San Diego,
        Sioux City, Tucson, and Washington, D.C. -- and spread throughout the
        country before the end of next year.
