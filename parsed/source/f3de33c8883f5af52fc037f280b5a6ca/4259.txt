             Senate Bipartisan Agreement in Support of the President's Voluntary National Testing
             Initiative

                  Today, President Clinton's proposal to set high national standards and test students in 4th
                   grade reading and 8th grade math gained the strong, bipartisan support of the Senate. This
                   helps to insure that parents, teachers, students and communities will receive high quality
                   information on whether students are reaching high standards, allowing us to hold schools
                   accountable and get extra help to those students who need it.

                  The bipartisan agreement reached today adopts the President's proposal to give authority
                   for the Voluntary National Tests to the bipartisan, independent National Assessment
                   Governing Board (NAGB). NAGB currently oversees the National Assessment of
                   Educational Progress, which tests a nationwide sample of students.

                  The agreement also makes NAGB more independent, helping to insure that the National
                   Tests will be free from politics in the years ahead.

                  Under the agreement, NAGB will gain an additional Governor from the other party, as
                   well as adding Mayors and additional businesspeople. The Board will continue to have
                   strong representation ofteachers, principals, school board members and other educators.

                  We are delighted that we will be able to move forward without further delay on the
                   President's plan, first announced in his State of the Union address this year.
