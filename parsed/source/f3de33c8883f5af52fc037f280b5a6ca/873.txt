TEXT:
attached revised accomplishments document - still has a way to go and
draft agenda for tomorrow's meeting.  I thought Nicole's earlier iteration
of the conference overview would be fine to hand out.  What do you think?
I'll also bring copies of the 4-page Reiner description as there no doubt
will be questions on that. Is there anything else? I'll drop over hard
copies. Thanks.

          CLINTON ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THE
          DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICA'S YOUNGEST CHILDREN

       "Learning begins in the first days of life. Scientists are now discovering how young
       children develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first days, and how
       important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their
       infants.... We already know we should start teaching children before they start school. "

                                              President Bill Clinton
                                              State of the Union Address
                                              February 4, 1997

Preparing our children for the 21 st century is among our most important national priorities.
Over the past few years, scientific research has demonstrated that the earliest years of life --
before children reach school age -- are critical to their cognitive, emotional and physical
development.
President Clinton is meeting the challenge to improve those years by investing in research,
supporting parents and caregivers, and investing in programs that provide early intervention to
disadvantaged families. The Clinton Administration is committed to building on this progress.
The President and the First Lady will convene a White House conference this spring to further
explore the implications of these scientific discoveries and research for parents and policy
makers.

43% increase in Head Start, created Early Head Start for 0-3 year olds and improved program
quality. For more than thirty years, Head Start has been one of our nation's best investments in
helping low-income parents be their children's first teacher, and in making sure that children start
school ready to read and ready to learn. For that reason, President Clinton has made expanding
and improving Head Start a priority of his Administration. Over the past four years funding for
the program has increased by 43% serving 800,000 low-income 3-4 year olds, including
thousands of 0-3 year olds and their families.    Initiated in 1994, Early Head Start now totals
142 programs across the country, expanding the proven benefits of early childhood development
to low income families with children under three and to pregnant women. Over the last three
years, the Clinton Administration has also invested significantly in improving program quality,
providing local programs with the resources they need to attract and retain high quality teachers
and to improve the quality and safety of the Head Start centers. The President's 1998 budget
proposal provides a $324 million increase, serving 122,100 more children than in 1993 while
continuing to increase program quality and the zero-to-three program and remain on course to
serve 1 million children by 2002.

Increased participants in WIC program by 1.7 million. WIC Supplemental Nutrition Program
provides nutrition packages, nutrition education and health referrals to low-income pregnant
women, infants, and children. Over the past four years participation has expanded by 1.7 million,
or 30% with the requested supplemental, from 5.7 to 7.4 million women, infants, and children.
The increases in the President's budget proposal fulfils his commitment to achieving full
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


participation in WIC by the end of 1998. Research shows that WIC prenatal services save
Medicaid much more by reducing health care costs in the first 60 days after birth.

Childhood Immunization Rates are at an All-Time High of 75 Percent. The President's
Childhood Immunization Initiative focuses on five areas: I)Improving the quality and quantity of
vaccination delivery services; 2) Reducing the vaccine cost for parents; 3)Increasing community
participation, education and partnerships; 4)Improving systems to monitor diseases and
vaccinations; and 5) Improving vaccines and vaccines use. This initiative builds on the efforts of
the past four years whereas in 1995, 75 percent of two-year olds were fully immunized -- an
historic high. Including both funding for vaccine purchases and for immunization program
activities, funding for childhood immunization has more than doubled since FY 1993. This has
resulted in tremendous savings because vaccines are cost effective. For example, more than $21
are saved for every $1 spent on measles/mumps/rubella vaccine and more that $29 are saved for
every $1 spent on diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine.

48% Increase for Children with Special Needs. Under the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA) the Infants and Families Program supports the continuing efforts of States
to implement quality statewide systems of early intervention services for infants and toddlers
with disabilities aged birth through two and their families. Over the past four years funding for
the program has increased by 48% or $102.5 million. During the same period, the number of
children served increased by 21.5 percent. An estimated 191,000 children will be served in FY
1998.

46% Increase in 4 years for Even Start. Even Start Family Literacy is a family-focused grant
program to improve the educational opportunities of children and their parents in low-income
areas by integrating family literacy activities, including early childhood education, adult
education, and parenting education. Over the past four years funding for Even Start has
increased by almost 46%. During the same period, the number of children estimated to be
participating in Even Start has increased almost 132 percent, to an estimated 51,000 children in
1996. Even Start received $102 million in funding in fiscal 1997, providing funding to every
state and the District of Columbia to reach 576 programs.

Fundingfor Child Care in Public Housing has Tripled. The Early Childhood Development
Program helps to provide quality child care opportunities for families living in public housing
communities. The program helps to establish childhood development services to facilitate the
employability of the parents or guardians who are residing in public housing, and to provide early
childhood development services to families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.
In 1996, $21 million was awarded to public housing sites across the country.

42 States now have funding for Parent Resource Centers. In addition to involving parents in the
development of state and local Goals 2000 education plans, the President's Goals 2000 program
provides funding for each state to establish parent resource centers that help parents learn. how to
help their children achieve high standards. The centers coordinate existing programs, provide
resource materials, and support a variety of promising models of family involvement programs.
In fiscal year 1997, $15 million in funding is available for support centers in 42 states, 14 more
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


than in 1996.



$300 Million Plan Promotes Parents as First Teachers. The President's America Reads
Challenge to make sure that every child can read well by the end of the third grade includes
Parents as First Teachers Challenge Grants that will invest in proven efforts to provide assistance
to parents who want to help ensure their children will read well. The grants will fund national
and regional networks to share information on how parents can help children to read and fund the
expansion of successful programs such as the Home Instruction Program for Preschool
Youngsters (HIPPY) or the Parents as First Teachers (PAT) program. The President's proposal
includes $300 million over 5 years for these grants.

Federal Government Supports Nearly 90% of all Children's Research. * The National Institutes
of Health now supports 32,000 grants in more than 1,700 universities, medical schools, and other
research institutions. This research has contributed to the major advance in brain research and
its impact on early learning and language development. NIH's funding has increased funding
23% to $12.7 billion in FY97.

Maintains the Commitment to the Medicaid Guaranteefor 30 Percent ofAll Children Under 6
Years Old. This Administration has protected, preserved, and will improve on the guarantee of
Medicaid coverage for 37 million Americans, including 10 million children under the age of 6. In
1995, the President vetoed the Republican Medicaid block grant proposal that would have ended
the guarantee of coverage for up to 4 million children by 2002. At the same time, the President
worked with States by granting 15 comprehensive Medicaid waivers and approving many more
State plan amendments that improve and expand coverage for children.

President's Plan Seeks to Extend Health Coverage to Up to 5 Million Children. Although this
Administration has made great strides in protecting the health of America's neediest children,
there is still much to be done. In 1995, more than 10 million American children had no health
insurance. Eighty percent (8 million) of the ten million uninsured children have a parent who is
a worker. Many uninsured children have parents who earn too much for Medicaid but too little
to afford private coverage, and an estimated three million children are eligible, but not enrolled in
Medicaid. The President's budget takes three important steps to address the problem of the
more than 10 million children who lack health insurance coverage:
1)      Provides annual grants to states to cover health insurance premiums for children whose
        parents are in-between jobs;
2)       Utilizes State Partnership Grants to help working families, who are not eligible for
        Medicaid, purchase private insurance for their children; and
3)      Invests to expand Medicaid coverage by allowing states to extend one year of continuous
        coverage to children eligible for Medicaid, intensifying outreach to children who are
        currently eligible but not enrolled, and expanding coverage to reach poor children
        between the ages of 13 - 18.

22% Increases in Child Carefunding. Since 1993 funding for child care has increased by 22%
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


providing quality services for over 660,000 children of which 65% are under 5 years of age. The
Child Care and Development Block Grant Amendments of 1996 provide an important
opportunity for states and·communities to plan a more cohesive child care system that responds
to the needs of all families and helps promote safe and healthy care for children of all ages.
Increased federal funding over a six year period allows for multi-year planning.
