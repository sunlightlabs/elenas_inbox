MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

THROUGH: Sylvia Matthews

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Diana Fortuna

SUBJECT:       SSA Report on Implementation of Children's SSI Cutoffs.

      The Social Security Administration intends to release a report this Thursday on its
implementation of the new definition of childhood disability for SSI. This report follows
Commissioner Ken Apfel's promise, at his corifirmation hearing in September, of a "top to
bottom" review of SSA's process for redetermining the eligibility of children.

         As you know, the welfare law tightened the definition of childhood disability for SSI, and
required the Social Security Administration to redetermine the eligibility of approximately
288,000 children, out of about one million children now on the rolls. These reevaluations have
led to almost 140,000 terminations to date. (At the time the welfare law was enacted, CBO
estimated that 180,000 children would lose SSI; when SSA announced its interpretation of the
law, it projected that 135,000 children would become ineligible.) Advocates charge that SSA has
done a poor job on these reevaluations, causing eligible children to be dropped from the rolls.

        The report concludes that SSA did a generally good job of redetermining eligibility for
these children. The report, however, identifies three areas of concern and announces actions to
address them.

        First, SSA will review the cases of all children "coded" as mentally retarded who were
cut from the rolls and have not appealed. This action addresses SSA's finding that some of these
children may have been terminated incorrectly. Second, SSA will review a portion of every
state's unappealed terminations, choosing the kinds of cases most needing review in each state
and focusing heavily on states that SSA has found to have a relatively high error rate. This
review will allow SSA to give special attention to states with the highest error rates, without
singling them out as "bad actors." Third, SSA will offer all 70,000 families who did not appeal
its termination decisions a new opportunity to do so. These actions, and the problems they
address, are further described in an appendix attached to this memo.

       In all, SSA will review the cases of 48,000 children dropped from the program. (Another
70,000 have appealed.) As a result of these actions, SSA now projects that approximately
100,000 children ultimately will lose SSI benefits.

       With the report, SSA also plans to release case studies of a random sample of 151
                                                                             Management System

children are no longer eligible. Most of the children have mental disabilities other than mental
retardation, including learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder. Over a third have
improved since they were first found eligible. The majority are teenagers; only a handful are age
SIX or younger.


        Advocates will probably have a mixed reaction to the report -- generally pleased about the
actions, but still arguing that SSA's regulation interpreting the statute is needlessly strict. The
report does not address the latter issue. The Republican leadership in Congress has been
extremely supportive of SSA's implementation of the law to date, but probably will criticize this
report on the ground that it bends over backwards to restore benefits.

                              SSA Report on Childhood Disability Process

     SSA's report examined three areas of concern raised by advocacy groups:

     I. Mental Retardation

     Advocates' Charge: Too many children with mental retardation were cut from the rolls.

     SSA Finding: Of the 136,000 children tenninated to date, 42,000 were "coded" as mentally
     retarded (MR). However, most of these children do not actually have MR, because until recently
     SSA's systems did not have all the necessary codes. Instead, most of these children have other
     mental disorders, such as learning disabilities or "borderline intellectual functioning" (which falls
     short offull-fledged MR). Some unknown subset of the 42,000 do have MR, but either their
     impainnents are not severe enough to qualify them for SS1, or they were denied incorrectly.

     Even with these tenninations, approximately 350,000 children coded as MR will remain on the
     rolls, out of the total of one million children on SSI.

     SSA Action: SSA will review all cases tenninated that were coded as MR, to ensure that all
     those decisions were made properly.

     II. State Variations in Cutoffs

     Advocates' Charge: Errors in cutoffs appear likely, since tennination rates varied widely by
     state, from 32% in Nevada to 82% in Mississippi. Also, SSA may not have acquired all
     documentation, such as school records, needed to judge a child's disability. Finally, some states
     were disqualifying too many families for failure to cooperate without making adequate efforts to
     reach them.

     SSA Findings: SSA data show that on average 93% oftennination decisions were both
     accurate and complete (i.e., they included all required documentation). This exceeds SSA's
     required level of overall state perfonnance for SS1, which is 90.6%. However, 10 states had
     accuracy/completion rates below 90%. Another 9 states had accuracy/completion rates below the
     national average. (SSA's experience is that about one-third of the errors identified in these
     measures will ultimately prove to be accurate decisions that simply lacked documentation.) SSA
     found that many inaccurate decisions stem from an overly strict interpretation of the new rules
     for children who exhibit maladaptive behavior.

     Claims that SSA did not acquire all needed documentation were detennined to be largely
     unfounded. However, SSA found wide state variations in the percentage of children cut off
     because their families did not cooperate with the redetermination. In a study of such cessations,
     SSA found that 68% of the cases did not include documentation that all required efforts to
     contact the family had been made.




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

SSA also perfonned a regression analysis to detennine whether wide state-to-state variations in
overall termination rates should be expected because oflegitimate factors, such as the child's age
and impainnent and whether the child was initially added to the rolls based on the less strict
criteria eliminated by the welfare law. SSA found that these factors would lead you to expect the
cutoff rate to vary from 40% in Idaho to 78% in Mississippi. While this regression analysis does
not fully explain the actual state-by-state variance, it does convince SSA that most of the
variance among states is due not to errors, but to characteristics of the children.

SSA Action: SSA will review a portion of the decisions in all states, focusing more on states
with lower accuracy rates. All cases tenninated as a result of failure to cooperate will be
reviewed. SSA will also provide more training on maladaptive behavior.

III. Appeal Rights

Advocates' Charge: Too few families are appealing because SSA's notice to families was
confusing, and workers discouraged appeals. Also, SSA discouraged families from requesting
that benefits be continued during the appeal, and didn't do enough to publicize free legal
services.

SSA Finding: SSA found that its workers did not discourage appeals, although this may have
occurred in isolated instances. At the same time, a survey conducted by SSA confinns that many
families did not understand their appeal rights.

SSA Action: All 70,000 families of children who were tenninated and did not appeal will be
given a new opportunity to do so. In addition, all families of children who appealed but did not
request continuation of benefits during the appeal will also be given a new opportunity to make
that request. SSA will also publicize the availability of free higal services for families.
