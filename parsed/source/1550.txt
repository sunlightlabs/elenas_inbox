                     WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM STRUCTURE OPTION

           Formula vs. Competitive share.

            The House-passed bill included two differing provisions, which also differed from the
            Senate passed bill:

                    House Ways and Means: 50% fonnula; 50% competitive.
                    House Education and Workforce: 95% fonnula; 5% competitive
                    Senate: 75% fonnula; 25% competitive

            OPTION: 70% fonnula; 30% competitive

            All provisions of the July 24th Conference bill draft with respect to allocating funds from
            the Federal to the State level, and from the State level to sub-state areas apply.

           Federal/State administration:

            The two House-passed bills provide for administration ofthe fonnula and the competitive
            parts by the Department of Labor arid, for the fonnula part within States, administration
            by the State and local Private Industry Council system under JTP A.

            The Senate-passed bill provides for administration of both parts through the Department
            of Health and Human Services and, for the fonnula part within States, administration by
            the State TANF system.


     I: \data\wtwadmin
              OPTION: Administration through the Department of Labor and the JTPAIPIC system,
              except that all competitive grants in the second year of the program must be awarded by
              the end of the 2d quarter of the fiscal year (March 31, 1999).

            The provision of the Ways and Means bill requiring Welfare to Work funds to be spent in
            accord with an agreement between the PIC and the TANF agency apply.

Option 1:
      If an individual participating in a work experience or community service program is an
       employee (as determined by current law), the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) applies.

       -- Participants who are employees are covered by employee protection laws such as the
       FLSA, the OSH Act, and anti-discrimination laws.

       -- Participants who are not employees (e.g., trainees) under the FLSA, will be covered by
       other employee protection laws such as the OSH Act and anti-discrimination laws.

               o In addition, they will be covered by a grievance procedure that includes the
               right to a hearing within a specified time period and appeal of an adverse finding
               to a neutral State agency selected by the Governor.

      Participants in activities funded by welfare-to-work funds or TANF cannot displace
       current employees (including a reduction in hours, wages, or benefits) or be employed in
       a job resulting from a layoff or a workforce reduction to create the vacancy or in a job that
       impairs promotional opportunities for current employees. (Senate provision)

      Regardless of "employee" status, participants in programs financed with welfare-to-work
       or TANF funds, and their employers, shall not be covered by unemployment
       compensation and FICA taxes. Such individuals shall not be eligible for the EITe.

Option 2:
      The determination of the applicability of the FLSA to participants in community service
       or work experience programs published in the Federal Register by the Department of
       Labor (DOL) on May 16, 1997 shall remain unchanged through September 30, 2000. The
       DOL shall not issue any other regulations, interpretations, or guidance on this matter prior
       to September 30, 2000.

       -- Participants who are not employees shall be treated as in Option 1.

      Anti-displacement provisions same as Option 1.

      Coverage of and eligibility for unemployment compensation, FICA, and the EITC same
       as Option 1.

Option 3:
      House provision, but sunset on September 30, 2000. Participants in work experience and
       community service programs during this period are not considered to be receiving
       compensation for work and are not entitled to a salary or work or training expenses.

      Unemployment compensation, FICA, and the EITC same as Option 1.
