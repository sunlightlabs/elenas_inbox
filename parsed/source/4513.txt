Subject: SOTU BOOK

Once again, we will prepare a "New Ideas" book that will explain in
greater detail the proposals presented by the President in his State of
the Union.  Each idea in the SOTU will be explained in the book.  One
paragraph (1/3 to 1/2 a page max) per idea.  Cost, if relevant should be
included. This book is distributed to the press, Members of Congress,
public interest groups, and other톑overnmental offices. The style of the
paragraphs should be the same as our one-pagers.

We need to have drafts of your one-pagers by COB Thursday, January 14th.
They will be reviewed by Elena, Bruce, and Chris over the weekend and go
to press on Monday.  SOTU is the 19th.  If you are not certain if an idea
will or will not be included, write it up if you think there is at least a
50% chance of it making it in the speech.

Attached is a draft of last year's document.

ENTITLEMENT REFORM

Reserve Surplus until Social Security is Reformed

Over the next two years, President Clinton is finnly committed to strengthening Social Security for the
21 st century. He therefore proposes that we should not spend any ofthe projected budget surpluses on
anything else until we have refonned Social Security. This proposal, which continues the fiscally
responsible policies that have been the hallmark of this Administration, is intended to reserve the
surpluses in case they are needed for Social Security refonn.


EDUCATION

Small Classes with Qualified Teachers to Improve Reading in Grades 1-3

President Clinton is proposing a $12.4 billion initiative over 7 years ($7.3 billion over 5 years) to help
local schools provide small classes with qualified teachers in the early grades. This initiative will help
ensure that every child receives personal attention, learns to read independently, and gets a solid
foundation for further learning. The new initiative will reduce class size from a nationwide average of
22 in grades 1-3 to an average of 18, providing funds to help local school districts hire an additional
100,000 well-prepared teachers. The initiative will also provide funds to states and local school
districts to test new teachers, develop more rigorous teacher testing and certification requirements, and
train teachers in effective reading instruction practices. School districts will be accountable for
demonstrating gains in reading achievement. These steps will help ensure that first through third grade
students are receiving high-quality reading instruction in smaller classes from competent teachers.

Modern School Buildings to Improve Student Learning

For students to learn, schools must be well-equipped and be able to accommodate smaller class sizes.
To address these and other critical needs, President Clinton is proposing federal tax credits to pay
interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds to build and renovate public schools. This initiative provides
more than double the assistance of the Administration's earlier school construction proposal, which
covered halfthe interest on an estimated $20 billion in bonds. The tax credits will cost the Treasury $5
billion over 5 years, and more than $10 billion over ten years. Of the $22 billion in bond authority,
nearly $20 billion for a new School Modernization Bonds. Half of this bond authority will be allocated
to the 100 school districts with the largest number of low-income children, and the other half will be
allocated to the states.

                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion




     Helping Students in Poor Communities Reach High Standards

     This initiative will strengthen public schools and help students master the basic and advanced skills
     where the need is greatest: in high-poverty urban and rural communities where low expectations, too
     many poorly prepared teachers, and overwhelmed school systems create significant barriers to high
     achievement. The Education Department will select approximately fifty high-poverty urban and rural
     school districts with: (1) a demonstrated commitment to use high standards and tests as tools to identify
     and provide help to students, teachers and schools who need it; (2) a strategy to prevent students from
     falling behind by ensuring quality teaching, challenging curricula, and extended learning time; (3)
     programs to end social promotion and tum around failing schools; and (4) evidence of improved student
     achievement. Added investments in these communities will accelerate their progress and provide models
     of successful, standards-based reform for the nation. The President's initiative will invest $200 million in
     FY99, and $1.5 billion over 5 years, in raising achievement and sharing lessons learned with school
     districts around the country.

     Early Intervention to Promote College Attendance

     President Clinton wi II soon announce a long-term effort to bring college opportunity to children in high-
     poverty areas by providing their families with early information about financial aid and appropriate
     academic preparation, as well as mentoring and other support services to help the children stay on track
     through high school graduation and into college.



     LEADING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY

     Fast Track

     America needs fast track to continue to create higher-paying jobs for more Americans. Without it,
     America's role as the largest exporter in the world will be put in jeopardy. And with new markets
     opening around the world, it is more important than ever to give the President traditional trade authority
     to break down trade barriers that put American products made by American workers at a disadvantage.
     Fast track legislation is essentially an agreement between Congress and the president on how Congress
     will consider United States trade agreements negotiated by the President. As part of that deal, the
     President agrees to extensively consult and coordinate with Congress throughout trade negotiations. In
     return, Congress votes on legislation implementing trade deals within a fixed period oftime, on a up or

bring the promise of21st century prosperity to African nations that are prepared to undertake the
hard work of reform. This legislation will introduce a new era of prosperity and partnership
between African reformers and the United States, expanding trade opportunities for African and
American workers, farmers and companies, and hope and opportunity for our children. This
legislation will encourage African nations to undertake sound growth policies by expanding trade
and encouraging investment.

Child Labor

This initiative will make the U.S. a world leader in the fight to reduce child labor. The initiative
focuses on reducing the most intolerable forms on child labor --"slavery" through forced or
indentured labor, work by very young children, and work in dangerous conditions -- by increasing
the nation's contribution to the International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC)
from $3 million to $30 million. The proposal also calls for additional agents for the U.S. Customs
Service to enforce the ban on the importation of goods made with forced or indentured child labor,
with a particular focus on rugs from South Asia. On the domestic front, the proposal includes a $50
million increase in migrant education to serve 100,000 more children of migrant farm workers and
a $9 million increase in the Department of Labor budget to enforce U.S. child labor laws --
especially in the agricultural sector.

Community and Economic Adjustment Initiative

To help communities compete in a global economy, the Community and Economic Adjustment
Initiative will borrow a page from the Administration's successful adjustment effort for base
closure communities. Modeled after the Defense Department's highly respected Office of Economic
Adjustment, the Office of Community and Economic Adjustment (OCEA) will provide grants and
other assistance to communities to develop an economic adjustment strategy. The President will
propose $50 million in additional community adjustment assistance as part of the Commerce
Department's Economic Development Administration's (EDA) budget. This will allow us to do
more for communities that have suffered through sudden and severe economic dislocation, such as
plant closings. As OEA has done for base closure communities, OCEA will closely with the
Departments of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and other federal
agencies to make communities aware of all available federal resources and to provide a coordinated
Administration response.



TRAINING

Reform of the Federal Job Training System

The President renewed his call for Congressional action to reform the job training system. In his 1995 .
G.I. Bill for America's Workers, he called for individual empowerment through skills grants,
streamlining through One Stop Career Centers, and better results through tough performance standards.
The House has passed legislation based on his vision. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act has
bipartis~ support and is under consideration in the Senate.

MOVING PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers

The President's budget will provide $283 million in FY99 for 50,000 new housing vouchers for welfare
recipients who need housing assistance to get or keep ajob. Families could use these housing vouchers to
move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate
emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time. These vouchers, awarded to
communities on a competitive basis, will give people on welfare a new tool to make the transition to ajob
and succeed in the work place. The proposal will complement the President's $100 million a year welfare
to work transportation plan, part of his NEXTEA bill, which will help welfare recipients make their daily
commutes.

Increasing Child Support Collections

President Clinton's crackdown on deadbeat parents is paying off: child support collections rose to a
record $13 billion in 1997, an increase of 63 percent since 1992. In the State ofthe Union, the President
set a goal of increasing collections to $20 billion by the year 2000.

Falling Welfare Caseloads

The President announced that we have met -- two years ahead of schedule -- the challenge he made
in last year's State of the Union to move two million more Americans off of welfare by the year
2000. New caseload numbers show that welfare caseloads fell by 4.3 million since President Clinton
took office, two million more than the 2.25 million decline he announced last year. The new figures,
from September 1997, show 9.8 million Americans on welfare, down from 14.1 million in January 1993-
- a drop of 30 percent.
Business Welfare to Work Commitments

In his State of the Union address last year, the President challenged the business community to create jobs
so that people can move from welfare to work. Today, nearly 3,000 companies have accepted the
President's challenge and joined a new national effort, called the Welfare to Work Partnership, which was
launched at the White House in May. Now, the President has challenged thousands more companies to
join the Partnership to give even more people a chance to work their way off welfare.

     Protecting Patients Through a Consumer Bill of Rights and Genetic Screening Protections

     The President called on Congress to pass federally enforceable consumer health care protections before it
     adjourns this fall. This Health Care Bill of Rights should contain a range of protections, including
     guaranteed access to needed health care specialists to ensure that patients are provided appropriate
     high quality care, access to emergency room services when and where the need arises, an assurance that
     medical records are confidential, and access to a meaningful internal and external appeals process for
     consumers to resolve their differences with their health plans and health care providers. The
     nation's health care system has changed dramatically, with more than 100 million Americans now
     in managed care plans. This legislation will ensure that whether Americans have traditional health
     insurance or managed care, they are assured quality care. And to ensure that new advances in
     genetics are used to improve health rather than to discriminate, the President has called for
     legislation prohibiting the use of genetic screening to discriminate in health insurance and
     employment.

     Creating a Historic "21st Century Research Fund"

     With Unprecedented Increases in Biomedical Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
     Scientists are on the cusp of important new breakthroughs in biomedical research, which could
     revolutionize the way medical experts understand, treat, and prevent some of our most devastating
     diseases. To promote this progress, the President's budget contains a historic up front investment in
     biomedical research -- a 1.15 billion increase in FY 1999 -- and proposes an increase in NIH funding of
     more than 50 percent over the next five years. Under the President's proposal, the NIH will devote over
     $20 billion to biomedical research in 2003.

     Providing New Options for Americans Ages 55 to 65 to Obtain
     Health Insurance, Including Buying Into Medicare

     Americans ages 55 to 65 are one ofthe most difficult-to-insure popUlations: they have less access to and a
     greater risk of losing employer-based health insurance; and they are twice as likely to have health
     problems as the population generally. The President's proposal gives this vulnerable population three
     new ways to gain access to health insurance by: (1) allowing Americans ages 62 to 65 to buy into
     Medicare, through a premium that ensures that this policy is self-financed; (2) assisting vulnerable
     displaced workers 55 and over by offering those who have involuntarily lost their jobs and health care
     coverage a similar Medicare buy-in option; and (3) giving Americans 55 and over who have lost their
     retiree benefits access to their former employers' health insurance.

Passing Comprehensive Bipartisan Tobacco Legislation That Reduces Teen Smoking and Changes
the Way Tobacco Companies Do Business

Every day 3,000 young people start smoking and 1,000 of them will die prematurely from a tobacco-
related disease. The President called on Congress to pass comprehensive national bipartisan legislation
that includes five key principles: (1) it must mandate the development of a comprehensive plan to reduce
teen smoking, including raising the cost of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack over the next 10 years as
necessary to meet youth smoking targets; (2) it must affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco
products; (3) it must include measures to hold tobacco companies accountable, especially for marketing
products to children; (4) it must include concrete measures to improve public health, from investing in
research to reducing second-hand smoke to expanding smoking cessation; and (5) it must protect the
financial well-being of tobacco farmers and their communities from the loss of income caused by our
efforts to reduce smoking.



CHILD CARE INITIATIVE

Double the Number of Children Receiving Child Care Subsidies
to More than Two Million

The President proposed to expand the Child Care and Development Block Grant to help working
families struggling to meet the costs of child care. This block grant is the primary federal subsidy
program to pay for child care, enabling low-income parents to work. Funds are distributed by
formula to the states to operate direct child care subsidy programs, as well as to improve the
quality and availability of care. The President's initiative will more than double the number of
children served from the one million served in FY 95 (the latest year for which data are available).
The President's budget will increase funding for the block grant by $7.5 billion (plus a state match)
over five years, which will enable states to provide subsidies for more than two million children by
2003.

Increase Tax Credits for Child Care for Three Million Working Families

The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit provides tax relief to taxpayers who pay for the care of
a child under 13 or a disabled dependent or spouse in order to work. The credit is equal to a
percentage of the taxpayer's employment-related expenditures for child or dependent care, with
the amount ofthe credit depending on the taxpayer's income. The President's proposal increases
the credit for families earning under $60,000, providing an additional average tax cut of $358 for
these families and eliminating income tax liability for almost all families with incomes below 200%
of poverty ($35,000 for a family of four) that claim the maximum allowable child care expenses.
The President's budget will include $5.2 billion over five years to expand the Child and Dependent
Care Tax Credit for three million working families.




                                                                 Automated Records Management System

The child care initiative includes a tax credit to businesses that provide child care services for their
employees, by building or expanding child care facilities, operating existing facilities, training child
care workers, or providing child care resources and referral services. The credit covers 25% of
qualified costs, but may not exceed $150,000 per year. The President's budget will include
approximately $500 million over five years for these tax credits.

Promote Early Learning

Research shows that children's experiences in the earliest years are critical to their development
and future success. The President's proposed Early Learning Fund provides challenge grants to
communities (distributed by states) to improve early learning and the quality and safety of child
care for children ages zero to five. Funds may be used for the following activities: providing basic
training to child care providers (including first aid and CPR); connecting individual child care
providers to centers for education and support; assisting child care providers to meet accreditation
and licensing requirements; linking child care providers with health professionals, and supporting
the inclusion of young children with special needs in quality child care settings; reducing group sizes
and child-to-staff ratios; and providing home visits, parent education, and consumer education
about child care. The President's Early Learning Fund builds on state initiativ"es such as North
Carolina's Smart Start, which helps North Carolina's children enter school healthy and ready to
succeed. The President's budget will include $3 billion over five years for this fund.

Increase Head Start and Double the Number of Children Served by Early Head Start

Head Start provides early, continuous and comprehensive child development and family support serVices,
preparing children for a lifetime ofleaming and development. The President's budget will invest an
additional $3.8 billion over five years to reach his goal of serving one million children by 2002, and
doubling the number of infants and toddlers in Early Head Start to 80,000.

Step Up Enforcement of State Health and Safety Standards

Building on the military's model child care program, this proposed initiative will fund state efforts
to improve licensing systems and enforce child care health and safety standards, including by
increasing unannounced inspections of child care settings. The President's budget will include
$500 million over five years for this program.

Facilitate Background Checks on Child Care Providers

On the day of the White House Conference on Child Care, the President transmitted to Congress
the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact, which will facilitate effective background
checks on child care providers by eliminating state law barriers to sharing criminal history
information for non-criminal purposes. Although the vast majority of child care providers are
dedicated to the teaching and nurturing of children, one tragedy in child care is too many.

for this responsibility.

Increase Scholarships and Training for Child Care Providers

At the White House Conference on Child Care, the President proposed establishing a Child Care
Provider Scholarship Fund to enable states to provide scholarship funds to students working
toward a child care credential. Eligible child care workers must commit to remaining in the field
for at least one year for each year of assistance received and will earn increased compensation or
bonuses when they complete their course work. The President proposed a federal investment of
$250 million over five years, which will support 50,000 scholarships per year. The President is also
proposing to expand the Department of Labor's Child Care Apprenticeship Program to fund the
training of child care providers.

Invest in Research

Because too little is known about our child care system, the President's budget will increase
support for data, research, and evaluation. This research fund will also support a National Center
on Child Care Statistics and a child care hotIine that parents can call to get information about how
to find child care in their communities and how to identify appropriate, quality care for their
children. In addition, the research fund will support demonstration projects to test approaches to
help new parents who choose to stay home to care for their newborns or newly adopted children.
The President's budget will include $150 million over five years for this fund.

Provides After-School Care for up to Half a Million Children a Year

The President proposes a dramatic expansion ofthe 21 st Century Community Learning Center Program
to provide start-up funds (with a local match) to school-community partnerships to establish or expand
before- and after-school programs for school-age children. The program increases the supply of after-
school care in a cost-effective manner by directing most funds to programs that use public schools and
their existing resources, such as computers, gymnasiums, and sports equipment. The program also
includes a set-aside to fund programs run by community organizations. The President's budget will
request $800 million of new money for this program, for a total of$1 billion over five years.



CRIME

Juvenile Crime Strategy

This initiative recognizes the threat juvenile crime poses to our communities and calls on Congress to pass
a comprehensive anti-gang and youth violence strategy. The President's proposed legislation targets gangs
and violent juveniles by (1) funding for new prosecutors ($100 million) and probation officers ($60
million); (2) helping our kids to stay gun- and drug-free by preventing violent juveniles from buying
guns when they turn 21; (3) enacting tough new sentences to punish adults who sell drugs to kids and
use kids to sell drugs; (4) helping kids to stay in school, off drugs, and out of trouble with new funding to

President's Child Care Initiative increases five-fold current funding for Department of Education-sponsored after

AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD

NATO Enlargement

Europe's stability and America's security are closely linked. The President's call for enlarging the NATO
alliance strengthens the alliance's core mission of collective defense and helps meet new threats such as
regional instability. Enlargement furthers other US objectives including: Encouraging states in the region
to settle border and ethnic disputes with neighbors; strengthen civilian control of their militaries; and
increase tolerance for ethnic and religious minorities. NATO's enlargement, combined with the
Partnership for Peace program, the NATO-Russia Founding Act and the NATO-Ukraine partnership will
help erase the outdated Cold War divisions and build, for the first time, an undivided, democratic, and
peaceful Europe.

Securing the Peace in Bosnia

The United States has an abiding interest in peace and stability in Bosnia and a compelling interest in the
implementation ofthe Dayton peace accords. After 46 months ofthe worst war in Europe since WWII,
24 months of implementing peace have helped put Bosnia on the path to lasting peace and stability.
Progress on implementation was made possible because of prudent military support. We can now see the
point where civil implementation and peace can be self-sustaining -- but Bosnia's fragile peace still needs
the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. The President
still must approve a detailed action plan being prepared by NATO military authorities after a full review
of all options. The President will insist that this action plan have the following elements: an achievable
mission tied to clear benchmarks, not a deadline; force must be able to protect itself; the U.S. must retain
command; European allies must shoulder their full share of responsibility; costs must be manageable; and
the plan must have substantial support of the Congress and the American people.

Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction Program (WMD)

President Clinton made clear that Iraq's efforts to develop nu~lear, chemical and biological weapons are
unacceptable. U.N. inspectors have done a remarkable job -- destroying more of Iraq's WMD potential
than was destroyed during the Gulf War itself. But Saddam is now refusing to allow inspectors to
complete their mission. All options are on the table to make sure Iraq does not pursue their WMD
program with impunity and threaten the international community.

Biological Weapons

President Clinton announced tonight that the United States would lead the effort to erect stronger
international barriers against the proliferation and use of biological weapons. Under this new initiative,
the United States will seek to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) by requiring nations

for Biological weapon purposes and agree to a tough international inspection system including both
voluntary and mandatory inspections.

Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

The President's call for Senate ratification ofthe CTBT will allow America to maintain a safe and reliable
nuclear deterrent while constraining the proliferation of nuclear material and technology to rogue states'
weapons programs. CTBT will improve America's ability to detect and deter nuclear explosive testing.
CTBT's global network of sensors will strengthen America's ability to monitor nuclear explosive testing
across the globe, as well as deter any nation from believing it can conduct a nuclear explosive test
undetected by the international community.

u.s. Arrears to the United Nations
The President also highlighted the need for prompt action on the payment of U.S. arrears to the United
Nations. The failure to pay undermines our ability to reform the U.N. and hinders our leadership of that
organization at very time the U.N. is working to prevent Iraq from threatening neighbors and the world
with weapons of mass destruction. We also need to give the International Monetary Fund the capacity to
help prevent global financial crises. Now, more than ever, our security at home and our interests abroad
demand that America meet our international obligations, sharpen the tools to improve the stability ofthe
world economy, and increase our leverage in international organizations.


A NATION THAT LIVES BY COMMUNITY

POLITICAL REFORM/REINVENTING GOVERNMENT

Free Television Time

Spending on congressional campaigns has increased more than three times the rate of inflation in the last
decades and spending on television is the primary reason. In 1972, candidates spent $25 million for
political ads; in 1996, they spent $400 million. In his State of the Union, President Clinton announced
that will request that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) require broadcasters to give
candidates for Federal office free time as a condition of receiving a new, lucrative license for digital
television. It is time to update broadcasters' public interest obligations to meet new political and
technological realities.

Enact Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform

The President remains committed to the enactment of bipartisan campaign finance reform. He is pleased
that the leadership in Congress has agreed to schedule a vote this Spring on the McCain-Feingold and
Shays-Meehan reform bills. But a vote on these bills is not enough. In his State of the Union the
President challenged Congress to enact real reform this year. Acceptable campaign finance reform
legislation must meet five criteria: 1) it must be bipartisan; 2) it must be comprehensive; 3) it must reduce
the amount of money that is raised and spent on federal elections; 4) it must help level the playing field

IRS Reform

President Clinton is strongly committed to reforming the IRS. This spring the Administration will
launch the first of 33 Citizen Advocacy Panels. These new panels will be locally-based,
independent boards of citizens established to monitor how local IRS offices treat taxpayers and
help taxpayers get their problems solved. These new panels are part of the new era of customer
service underway at the IRS. The successful new IRS problem solving days, which have helped
thousands of taxpayers get relief, will continue around the country on a monthly basis.
Additionally, as of the first of the year, IRS phones are now operating 16 hours a day, six days a
week. For the first time, IRS offices will be open Saturday mornings during the tax filing season --
March through mid-April-- to provide taxpayers a convenient opportunity to walk-in and get any
questions answered. Also, the IRS expects this year to expand its award-winning Telefile program.
 This innovative program allowed 4.7 million taxpayers to file their returns with a quick average 10
minute phone call last year.



COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

Since its creation in 1986, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) has given states tax
credits of $1.25 per capita to allocate to developers of affordable housing. Even though
building costs have increased 40 percent in the last decade, the amount of the credit has not
been adjusted for inflation. Therefore, President Clinton and Vice-President Gore propose to
increase the cap on the LIHTC from $1.25 per capita to $1.75 per capita - restoring the value
of the credit to its 1986 level. Estimates suggest that the LIHTC currently helps build
80,000-90,000 affordable housing units each year. The President and Vice President's proposal
to increase the cap by 40 percent will create an additional 160,000-180,000 new rental housing
units for low-income American families over the next five years. This proposal will cost $1.6
billion over five years.

Empowerment Zones

Building on the Administration's successful first round of Empowerment Zones which has
helped spur the creation of jobs and private investment in America's distressed communities,
the President's budget includes a request for $1.7 billion to support flexible grants to 20 new
Empowerment Zone designations. The funding will be made available to the designated
communities over a 10 year period. The 15 urban designations will be funded at $100 million
each; and the five rural designations will be funded at $40 million each. The Departments of
Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture will announce a competition this Spring that
will lead to the designation of the 20 new Empowerment Zones by December 1998.

The President's FY99 budget provides funds for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation
to start a new initiative to help provide the opportunity of homeownership to responsible
families with a perfect rental history. Under this initiative, we will help 10,000 lower-income--
and often minority -- families become homeowners. While the method of helping each family
buy their own home will differ, responsible families we will be provided homeownership
counseling, flexible assistance for downpayment or closing costs, second mortgage loans for
debt reduction, or rehabilitation loans.

Homeownership Zones

The FY99 budget includes funds for Homeownership Zones to be used by communities to
reclaim abandoned and distressed neighborhoods through the creation of large-scale
developments of owner-occupied single-family homes. Funds could be used for property
acquisition, housing construction, housing rehabilitation, demolition, site preparation, homeownership
counseling, relocation, housing marketing, activities to ensure fair housing, and other activities
essential to homeownership.



ENVIRONMENT

Climate Change Initiative

Following the historic agreement reached in Kyoto in December 1997, and as part ofthe
President's and Vice President's ongoing efforts to address climate change, the President is
proposing a dramatic new program of tax cuts and R&D aimed at cutting greenhouse gas
emissions. The proposed package contains tax cuts to promote energy efficiency and additional
research and development spending covering the four major carbon-emitting sectors of the
economy (buildings, industry, transportation, and electricity), plus carbon removal and
sequestration, Federal facilities, and cross-cutting analyses and research. This package
complements the other elements of the Administration's climate change plan, which include
working with industry to develop sector-by-sector initiatives to cut emissions, incorporating
energy efficiency goals into Federal procurement and energy use, and restructuring the
electricity industry. These efforts strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving
efficiency and reducing costs to the consumer. They provide a solid step on the way to meeting
the goals of the Kyoto Agreement.

communities curb polluted runoff from farms and city streets, reducing exposure to harmful
organisms and toxic contaminants in drinking water and fish, and promoting community-based
watershed management in partnership with landowners and affected industries. The initiative targets
the 40 percent of the nation's waterways still unsafe for fishing and swimming. It provides substantial
new resources to assist states in implementing these programs and to create incentives for farmers to
adopt practices that protect water quality.     .

Food Safety Initiative

The Clinton Administration launched a new food safety initiative last year to put in place new
science-based preventive systems to improve the safety of seafood, meat, and poultry and begin work
on a new early warning system to help detect and respond to outbreaks of food borne illness. Our
budget will seek an even more substantial increase in funding to further enhance food safety. The
resources will go to a variety of initiatives, including: giving FDA authority to prevent the
importation of produce from countries without safety precautions equivalent to our own; hiring FDA
inspectors to improve the safety of fruits and vegetables, both domestic and imported; developing
new ways for federal inspectors to detect foodborne illnesses in meat and poultry and determine the
source of contamination; improving educational outreach on proper food handling; and further
expanding our early warning system and strengthening state surveillance activities for foodborne
illnesses.


CIVIL RIGHTS

Reforming and Strengthening the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC)

This initiative expands the EEOC's ADR program over three years to allow as many as 70 percent of
all complainants to choose mediation, rather than the lengthy process of investigation and litigation.
In the first year, the EEOC will provide ADR in a projected 16,000 cases -- 20 percent of all
incoming cases and double the number currently sent to mediation. In addition, through a
combination of increased use of mediation, improved information technology, and an expanded
investigative staff, the EEOC will reduce the average time it takes to resolve a private sector
complaint from over 9 months to 6 months, and reduce the backlog of cases from 64,000 to 28,000 by
the year 2000. The proposal provides $279 million for the EEOC for FY99 -- $37 million or 15
percent more than the enacted 1998 budget.

TECHNOLOGY

A Family-Friendly Internet

                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion




     President Clinton and Vice President Gore support a strategy to protect children and create a
     safe, educational environment on the Internet that is consistent with our First Amendment
     values. This strategy includes cracking down on obscenity, child pornography, and online
     stalking, and encouraging the private sector to develop filtering and blocking technology for
     parents and teachers that is widely available and effective. This fall, the Administration will
     join the private sector and non-profit groups to support "Internet Teach-Ins" at schools and
     libraries, which are designed to increase awareness of safe on-line behavior for children and
     access to good content


     Making the Internet a Global Free-Trade Zone

     The Administration is committed to creating an environment in which global electronic
     commerce can flourish, so that every computer will be a window open to every business, large
     and small. Over the next several years, Internet commerce could increase to hundreds of
     billions of dollars per year, boosting U.S. exports and creating new opportunities for small
     start-up companies. President Clinton has directed the U.S. Trade Representative to work with
     foreign governments to secure agreement that all products and services delivered across the
     Internet and all equipment from which the Internet is built -- be free from tariffs.

     Cloning

     President Clinton has proposed legislation banning the cloning of human beings. The President's
     legislative proposal prohibits for five years the use of somatic cell nuclear technology to create a
     human being. The legislation directs the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to report to the
     President in four and half years on whether to continue the ban. The proposal is carefully worded
     to ensure that it will not interfere with beneficial biomedical and agricultural activities. In March
     1997, the President imposed a ban on the use of federal money for cloning human beings.

     Save America's Treasures

     Many of our most important cultural treasures -- such as the Star Spangled Banner, the Declaration of
     Independence, and the Bill of Rights -- are seriously at risk. "Save America's Treasures" is a three year,
     $150 million initiative that will help stimulate support for the Nation's most important preservation
     priorities. The funds will be administered by the Department of Interior under the authority of the
     National Historic Preservation Act. Half of the money will support preservation projects identified at the
     national level -- the other half will go to support state and local priorities.
