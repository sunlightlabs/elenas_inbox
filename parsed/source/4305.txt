MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:               Tobacco Communications and Legislative Strategy


        Over the past two weeks, we have met with Erskine, OVP, NEC, OMB, HHS, Treasury,
and Justice to develop an aggressive communications plan to help turn up the heat on Congress
to pass comprehensive bipartisan tobacco legislation this year. This memo presents you with our
proposal, and provides an update on the legislative strategy we discussed with you last month.

Communications Strategy

      We are organizing a series of events for you and others, including House and Senate
Democrats, to begin a drumbeat that Congress should not go home without passing
comprehensive tobacco legislation.

        Our message is simple: Every day Congress fails to pass tobacco legislation, 3,000 kids
start smoking and 1,000 will die early as a result. We can dramatically reduce teen smoking and
save a million lives over the next 5 years if we pass our budget proposal now.

        We must continue to stress that we need a comprehensive, not piecemeal, approach that
raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years, expressly confirms the
FDA authority to regulate tobacco products, gets tobacco companies out of the business of
marketing to children, furthers public health research and goals, and protects tobacco farmers and
their communities.

         In the next week, we plan to underscore our commitment to bipartisan, comprehensive
legislation in several ways:

      Secretary Shalala will meet with editorial boards to explain our goals and priorities.

      In your March 7th radio address, we hope you will challenge the Congress not to go
       home this year without passing legislation that will dramatically reduce teen smoking, and


                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

       On Sunday, March 8th, The Washington Post will begin a three day series chronicling
        the tobacco wars from the drafting of the FDA rule to present, hopefully underscoring
        our long commitment to this issue and the need for action.

       On March 9th, in your speech to the AMA on health care quality, we hope to have you
        laud the doctors' support for comprehensive tobacco legislation.

       When Senators Chafee, Harkin, Lugar and Graham announce their bipartisan plan --
        probably the week of the 9th -- weare hoping to have the Vice President appear with
        them.                                                       .

       Starting March 11th, the Democratic leadership will announce a countdown calendar,
        starting a daily drumbeat of how every day that passes without enacting tobacco
        legislation, 3,000 kids start smoking, causing 1,000 to die a premature death. Jeffords
        will mark up his FDA bill the same day, providing us with an opportunity to underscore
        the importance of the tough advertising and access restrictions in our FDA rule and the
        need for legislation which reaffirms the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco. Rep. Fazio
        will likely introduce a slightly revised version of Senator Conrad's bill the same day.

       In a March 12th speech to the attorneys' general, we hope to have you announce state-by-
        state numbers of how many lives will be saved by comprehensive tobacco legislation.
        This is the same day as the last Bliley hearing, when the industry is under subpoena to
        release more documents. It is also the first day of markup for the McCain's Senate
        Commerce Committee.

       On March 13th, we would like to leak a political memo by Geoff Garin and Mark
        Mellman on the popularity of tobacco legislation.

       On Saturday, March 14th, the Vice President will convene a regional tobacco roundtable
        in Boston, inviting key members of Congress (Kennedy, Chafee, Jeffords).

Legislative Strategy

   As you know, we are using these remaining weeks before the Congressional recess in early
April to lay the groundwork for a possible bipartisan summit to negotiate comprehensive tobacco
legislation; We have been (1) attacking Republican plans to enact piecemeal legislation; (2)
praising comprehensive bills, such as Senator Conrad's, which meet your principles; and, (3) in
the next week, we will hold meetings with the Democratic Caucus and quite conversations (led
by Erskine) with key Republicans in both the House and Senate.



                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

         There have been several significant developments over the last two weeks:

            Senator Conrad introduced his comprehensive legislation, and the Vice President
             appeared at his announcement to praise the bill. The bill has only Democratic co-
             sponsors. Rep. Fazio is planning to introduce a companion bill on March 11th.
            Senator McCain is planning to report a bill out of the Commerce Committee by March
             18th, and his staff tells us they would like to produce a bill that we would support. They
             are starting with S. 1415, McCain's bill codifying the Attorneys' General settlement, and
             we are providing him with advice and technical assistance. As you know, we responded
             last week to 74 written questions posed by Senator McCain.

            Senators Chafee and Harkin are still working to forge a bipartisan bill that can attract
             other Republicans. They had hoped to be able to announce a plan this week, but now
             the week of March 9th seems more likely.

            Rep. Bliley plans to complete his hearings, and then may begin to draft legislation in the
             House Commerce Committee. We understand that while Bliley and Waxman have been
             talking, they are not drafting joint legislation.

         Erskine, Larry, and I will meet in the next week with Senator Conrad and the Senate
      Democratic Tobacco Task Force, Rep. Fazio and the House Democratic Tobacco Task Force,
      Senator McCain, Rep. Bliley, Senator Chafee, Senator Hatch, Senator Domenici, Senator Mack,
      and Representative Pryce.




                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
