 (here fyi are the q&as -- has data on page 1 you may want)
(also these q&as started with good talking points that may be helpful)

A few general comments --

        As you know, we want this to be about kids, kids, kids, not about
the Surgeon General's report  -- but I you should use a couple of the
statistics from the report to make your point, i.e. -- Youth smoking is
increasing at an alarming rate.   Today one third more high school students
smoke than did six years ago.   And as this new Surgeon General's report
shows, smoking has increased among all racial and ethnic groups, growing
by a startling 80 percent among African American youth.   Today, nearly
one-half of young Native Americans, two-fifths of Caucasians, one third of
Hispanics, and one-fifth of Asian and African American high schoolers
smoke. Every day, 3000 children become regular smokers ... and 1000 of
them will die as a result.

        I'm not sure about the sick child analogy.    I've faxed this draft
to Bruce to see what he thinks, but I'm not sure I'll hear back tonight.
I think the "we'll do everything we can to keep our children from harm"
theme is good .... it's the illness theme in the second to last paragraph
that gives me pause.    I think it's because what legislation would do is
prevent illness not cure it.     How about We have now within our grasp a
way to protect millions of children, to keep them from taking up a deadly
habit that -- as Dr. Satcher and Dr. Frist can tell you -- causes cancer
and heart attacks and lung disease.     We can stop young Americans from
smoking before they start and save one million lives over the next five
years.   For our children's sake, we cannot let this opportunity slip
away.

 More suggestions are below in bold.    Please page me if you have
questions.


PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS FOR SURGEON GENERALD,S REPORT
   '.
THE WHITE HOUSE
APRIL 26, 1998
[should be 4/27)


Anyone who has ever been a parent knows the absolute joy -- and the
awesome repsons{bility -- that comes with raising a child.  We will do
everything we can to keep our children safe from harm -- from strapping on
their seat belts in the car, to bundling them up against the winter cold,
to teaching them to say no to drugs. [don't raise drugs -- Republicans are
trying to use that to change the subject -- use something else -- like
?walking them to school each day?)

         We accept that we cannot always predict all the challenges that
may come our childrenD,s way.   But the dangers and consequences of tobacco
are plain to all.   The temptation to try tobacco is one of the greatest
threats our children face. [How about making this less about prediction
and temptation (which implies too much free will, I think) and instead
saying something like "But we all know how hard it is to protect children
from danger.   We have known the dangers of tobacco for a long time -- ever
since the Surgeon General's landmark 1964 report -- but still our children
are falling prey.")

        That is why todayD,s disturbing news -- that more 'and more
minority teens are falling to the tempation of cigarettes -- must
galvanize our efforts to protect all our children from tobacco. We all
know that todayD,s statistics are part of a larger trend:   Every day,
3,000 young people light up their first cigarettes and become smokers for
life. One thousand of them will die as a result.    [Youth smoking is
increasing at an alarming rate. Today one third more high school students
smoke than did six years ago.  And as this new Surgeon General's report
shows, smoking has increased among all racial and ethnic groups, growing
by a startling 80 percent among African American youth.   Today, nearly
one-half of young Native Americans, two-fifths of Caucasians, one third of
Hispanics, and one-fifth of Asian and African American high schoolers
smoke.  Every day, 3000 children become regular smokers ... and 1000 of
them will die as a result.)

        The cold hard facts are adding up.  The call to action is getting
louder. And time is running out. Congress has just four weeks to pass a
comprehensive bipartisan tobacco bill that can help save the lives of
millions of our children -- that will cut teen smoking by raising the
price of cigarettes, imposing strong penalties on tobacco companies who
continue advertising to children, and giving the FDA full authority to
regulate childrenD,s access to tobacco products. [Four weeks isn't really
right    there are four weeks until-the Memorial Day recess -- I would say
"just weeks") [Use this "by raising the price of cigarettes, putting into
place tough restrictions on advertising and access, imposing penalties on
the industry if it continues to sell cigarettes to children, and ensuring
that the FDA has authority to regulate tobacco products -- all while
protecting farmers and farming communities.")

        Senator McCainD,s bill is a strong step in this direction.   Make
no mistake about it: The legislation explicitly changes the rules of the
game so that the tobacco industry can no longer do what it has done for
years -- profit at the expense of our childrenDts health.

        It is time to end the delay.  It seems as if weD,re in a situation
where we know what the illness is -- too many children lured to smoking by
unscruplous, multi-million dollar advertising campaigns that have targeted
our youth for decades. We know that the cure is -- tough, comprehensive
bipartisan legislation to end these practices and cut teen smoking. And
yet weD,re hesitating.  No parent who knows how to cure a sick child would


stand by and do nothing.  For our childrenD,s sake, we must not walk away
from this session of Congress without a comprehensive tobacco bill.   [How
about: We have now within our grasp a way to protect millions of children,
to keep them from taking up a deadly habit that -- as Dr. Satcher and Dr.
Frist can tell you -- causes cancer and heart attacks and lung disease.
We can stop young Americans from smoking before they start and save one
million lives over the next five years.   For our children's sake, we
cannot let this opportunity slip away.)


         I donD,t want to turn this tobacco settlement into a political
issue for the fall.  I want an achievement for this spring -- a
bipartisan tobacco law that will open a "new chapter in Ameri"caD, s efforts
to protect the health of our children.    Let us all work together to build
a brighter future for our children. [maybe "happier, healthier future??")

                       Surgeon Gene'ral Report on Minority Tobacco Use
                                        April 27, 1998

Q.        What does the Surgeon General's Report say?

A.The Surgeon General's Report being released today is the first comprehensive
      report on the use and health effects of tobacco among minority groups.
      The report finds that from 1991 to 1997, smoking increased by 80 percent
      for African-American youths and by 34 percent for Hispanic youth. The
      report finds that cigarette smoking is a major cause of disease and
      death among minority populations, which will only get worse if these
      trends are not reversed.  The report also documents that efforts to
      reduce and prevent smoking among minority and ethnic populations are
      undermined by the tobacco industry's heavily targeted advertising and
      promotion of tobacco products within these communities.

In short, the report demonstrates, once again, why Congress needs to pass
      comprehensive tobacco legislation to reduce youth smoking this year.

A:The Surgeon General's report shows the need for comprehensive tobacco legislation to reduce
      youth smoking that includes limits on advertising. The report found that the tobacco
      industry has targeted advertising and promotion campaigns intensively in minority and
      ethnic communities. For example, a 1990 study of San Francisco found that 62 percent of
      billboards in predominantly African American neighborhoods advertised cigarettes,
      compared with 36 percent of billboards citywide. A 1993 study of San Diego found the
      highest proportion of billboards featuring tobacco companies was in Asian American
      neighborhoods, followed by African-American then Hispanic neighborhoods.

The report chronicles how tobacco companies have promoted their products by sponsoring
                                                 numerous ethnic activities and events, such
                                                  as Chinese New Year festivities, Cinco de
                                                 Mayo festivities, as well as activities related
                                                 to AsianlPacific Heritage month and
                                                 African-American history month. A study
                                                 of magazines found that there were 12
                                                 percent more cigarette advertisements in
                                                 magazines targeted to African Americans
                                                 (Jet, Ebony and Essence) then in magazines
                                                 targeted to the general population (Time,
                                                 Newsweek, People, and Mademoiselle).

Q.Does the President have a specific proposal to address the particular problem of tobacco
      use within minority communities?

A.Passing comprehensive tobacco legislation designed to reduce youth smoking will help all
       Americans -- regardless of their background or ethnicity. The Surgeon General's report
       illustrates that this is an extremely important issue in minority and ethnic communities. It
       also demonstrates that we need to better understand the use and effects of tobacco among
       minority and ethnic groups. For example, we want to look carefully at why smoking rates
       increased by 80 percent for African-American youth and by 34 percent among Hispanics
       from 1991 to 1997 so that we can develop the prevention and cessation programs that will
       work best in those communities. We will continue to work closely with minority health
       experts to determine how best to address these issues.

Q:Why are the smoking rates of African Americans lower than whites?

A:The Surgeon General report documents a number of studies that show that differences in
      social attitudes and lifestyle factors between white and African-American youth help
      account for their different smoking rates. However, further research is needed to better
      account for these different smoking rates as well as to understand the recent increases in
      smoking among African-American youth.

                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
       seniors have become increasingly more likely than white seniors to acknowledge the
       health risks of tobacco, to claim that smoking is a "dirty habit", and to claim that they
       prefer to date non-smokers. African-Americans are also likely to start smoking later than
       whites.

One study in Tennessee showed that white high school age girls are four times more likely than
       their African-American counterparts and white boys twice as likely as African-American
       boys to believe that "smoking can help you control your weight and appetite." This same
       study revealed that 60 percent of white girls and nearly 20 percent of white boys cited
       weight control as a reason for smoking, whereas none of the African-American students
       cited weight as a reason for smoking. Another study showed that African-American
       teenage girls are less likely than white girls to think that smoking enhances their image.

A previous Surgeon General's report found that when parents express concerns about smoking it
       appears to reduce the likelihood that their children will smoke. Various studies across the
       country have documented that African-Americans are more likely to have received anti-
       smoking messages from their parents.

Q.Aren't the minority health organizations and the Congressional Minority Caucuses
     drafting legislation to address the problem of tobacco use among minorities,
     including by earmarking funds to this issue? What is your reaction to these
     proposals?

A.Comprehensive legislation that meets the principles that the President has outlined would
     address many aspects of this problem: the best way to reduce youth smoking among
     minority popUlations is to design effective, comprehensive legislation that will reduce
     youth smoking in all our communities. But the Surgeon General's report underscores the
     need to understand the use and effects of tobacco among minority communities, and to
     devise the prevention and cessation programs that will work best in those communities.
     We look forward to reviewing closely any proposals that address our shared concerns.

Q:Aren't the fees imposed by the Administration's plan and the McCain bill regressive and
     therefore hit minority communities hardest?

A:The tobacco industry has spent billions of dollars marketing to low-income and minorities, and
       made billions of dollars at their expense. Big Tobacco doesn't care about poor people --
       it just wants to keep hooking future smokers. As a result, low-income people have
       suffered a disproportionate level of tobacco-related harm. The Administration is
       committed to making sure cessation programs are available to help all smokers quit -- and
      just as important, that we change the way the tobacco industry does business so it no
       longer preys on poor kids in the first place.

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
      young African Americans are smoking more to enhance the high from marijuana?

A: This Administration has long recognized that cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs all pose a
       serious threat to our youth. Studies have shown that kids who make 톓t to their 21 st
       birthday without having smoked a cigarette, taken a drink or turned to drugs are almost
       certain to avoid chemical dependency throughout their lives. That is why our goal must
       be to keep teenagers from having that first drink, trying a cigarette, or experimenting with
       illegal drugs before they are old enough to know better and to realize the consequences of
       their decisions.

We are greatly concerned by data showing that smoking among African American youth has
       increased by 80 percent over the last six years. New information relating this trend to
       marijuana use is very disturbing, and provides still further reason to take strong action
       against illegal drugs. Of course, as The New York Times points out, the increase in
       tobacco use is even more heavily associated with advertising and other media messages
       that have a great impact on young people. That's why minority youth tend to smoke Kool
       and Newport, brands advertised with minority images, while white youth smoke
      Marlboro and Camel, whose ads feature white characters.

These facts underscore why we need comprehensive legislation to reduce youth smoking by
       raising the price of cigarettes, putting into place tough restrictions on advertising and
       access, imposing penalties on the industry ifit continues to sell cigarettes to children, and
       ensuring that the FDA has authority to regulate tobacco products.

Q.What do you think of the House Republican proposal to link drugs and tobacco in a
     single bill?

A.Nobody disagrees about the need to be tough on drug use, but that is no excuse to be less than
      tough on youth smoking. We need to pass strong, comprehensive tobacco legislation this
      year that dramatically reduces youth smoking by raising the pack of cigarettes, imposing
      tough penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids, granting the FDA authority
      over tobacco products, and restricting advertising and marketing to children. The
      McCain bill, which passed the Senate Commerce Committee by a 19-1 vote three weeks
      ago, is a strong step in that direction. If Republicans want to add good anti-drug
      provisions to a comprehensive tobacco bill of this kind, we have no objections. But the
      bill must address the problem of youth smoking comprehensively; anti-drug provisions
      can't serve as an excuse for watered-down tobacco legislation.

Q:     What exactly is the President's strategy on drugs?

A      This past February President Clinton released the 1998 National Drug Control Strategy, a
       comprehensive ten-year plan to reduce drug use and availability by 50% -- to a historic
       new low. The strategy is backed by a $17 billion anti-drug budget in FY 1999 -- the
       largest ever presented to Congress, with a $1.1 billion increase over last year's budget.

 programs, its number one goal is to educate and enable our youth. to reject illegal drugs.
 That is why the largest budget increases (15% over last year's funding levels) are targeted
 for this purpose. In contrast, Speaker Gingrich and the House Republicans tried to cut the
 Safe and Drug-Free Schools program -- the program that funds anti-drug efforts in 97%
 of the nation's school districts -- by a fu1l50%just a few years ago.

 Key initiatives in the drug strategy include:

 Protecting Kids:
        $195 Million National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign to make sure that when
        kids tum on the television or surf the "net," they learn about the dangers of drugs.
        $50 Million for School Drug Prevention Coordinators to improve and expand the
        Safe and Drug-Free Schools program by hiring more than 1,000 new prevention
        professionals to work with thousands of schools in preventing drug use .

. Strengthening Our Borders:
        $163 Million for Border Patrol to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol officers and for
        "force multiplying" technology.
        $54 Million for Advanced Technology for the Customs Service to deploy
        advanced technologies, such as X-ray systems and remote video surveillance.
        $75.4 Million to Support Interdiction Efforts in the Andean region and Caribbean,
        and to train Mexican counterdrug forces.

 Strengthening Law Enforcement:
       $38 Million to Crack Down on Methamphetamine and Heroin by hiring 100 new
       DEA agents, expanding the Administration's anti-methamphetamine initiative,
       and targeting heroin traffickers.

 Breaking the Cycle of Drugs and Crime:
       $85 Million to Promote Coerced Abstinence to help state and local governments
       implement drug testing, treatment, and graduated sanctions for drug offenders.

 Closing the Treatment Gap:
        $200 Million Increase for Substance Abuse Block Grants to help states close the
        treatment gap.

                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
     bill?

A.Every day, 3000 children and adolescents begin smoking, and 1,000 will die prematurely as a
      result. Experts agree that in order to dramatically reduce youth smoking we need to take
      a comprehensive approach that will attack the problem from a variety of angles .

        Price: All experts agree that the single most important step we can take to reduce youth
                smoking is to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes significantly. That is why the
                President has proposed raising the price of cigarettes by $1.10 over five years -- an
                increase that both the Treasury Department and the Congressional Budget Office
                agree should cut youth smoking by about a third .

        Advertising: Studies show that industry advertising significantly contributes to youth
       .      smoking rates. The Treasury Department has estimated that the advertising and
              marketing restrictions in the McCain bill should cut youth smoking by about 15
              percent. This is a conservative estimate: a study recently published in the Journal
              of the American Medical Association found that a full 34% of teen smoking is
              attributable to promotional activities .

        FDA Jurisdiction: Reaffirming the FDA authority over tobacco products is necessary to
              help stop young people from smoking before they start. Currently, nearly 90
              percent of people begin smoking before age 18, despite the laws that make it
              illegal to sell cigarettes to minors. FDA Authority will ensure that young people
              do not have access to these products .

        Penalties: Strong lookback penalties will act as an insurance policy to ensure that the
               tobacco industry takes meaningful steps to reduce youth smoking. If the bill's
               provisions on price, advertising, and FDA jurisdiction do. not bring youth smoking
               down as much as expected, penalties will kick in to ensure that the industry has
               every incentive to take further action to reduce youth smoking.

All of these measures support and reinforce each other; all are necessary to ensure that legislation
        dramatically reduces youth smoking.

Q: Isn't the President's plan a big government, big tax proposal?

A: No. What the President's approach does is to attack the problem of youth smoking
       comprehensively, as all experts say we need to do, by combining strong provisions on
       price, penalties, advertising and access, and FDA jurisdiction. Although we have some
      differences with Senator McCain, he also recognizes the need to move forward on all
      these fronts to reduce youth smoking. That's not about big government. It's about
       sensible, bipartisan steps to dramatically reduce youth smoking.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

A.No -- this isn't about big government. That's just another Big Lie from Big Tobacco. What
       the bill does is to ensure that the federal government has the authority to regulate tobacco
       products in order to reduce youth smoking, as well as the ability to target tobacco
       revenues to strong public health and research efforts. The so-called "bureaucracies" that
       the industry is now complaining about are nothing more than what's necessary to protect
       the public health in this way -- to ensure that cigarettes are not sold to minors, to promote
       effective education, and to encourage smoking cessation. The proof that this is an
       industry con job is clear: almost all these provisions were in the June 1997 proposed
       settlement put forward by 41 state attorneys general, which the industry agreed to. The
       industry is criticizing these provisions now only because the political tide has turned
       against it, and certain other aspects of the legislation have gotten stronger.

Q: Hasn't the Administration proposed a big government scheme that would extend the
      reach of the federal government to every mom-and-pop grocery store?

A: No. The Administration has offered proposals designed to reduce smuggling that would
     require wholesalers, distributors, and retailers to identify themselves as such. That's no
     more than what any business has to do now to sell liquor -- and no more than what most
     states already require sellers of tobacco to do. The important thing is to work with
     Congress to devise a scheme that will facilitate the effort to prevent smuggling, while not
     burdening retailers. The Administration will work with Congress, and the retailers
     themselves, on this issue.

Q:Aren't you just trying to bankrupt the companies?

A: We don't want to put the tobacco companies out of business. We just want to put them out of
      the business of selling cigarettes to kids. A central feature of comprehensive tobacco
      legislation is to ensure that most of the payments made by the tobacco companies are
      passed on to price, in order to reduce youth smoking. As a result, there will be at most a
      modest impact on the profitability of the tobacco companies. This is also an industry
      with significant cash flow and net assets that will allow it to easily absorb this modest
      profit decline. The operating earnings ofRJR, Philip Morris, and Loews last year were
      $18 billion. Even RJR, the most highly leveraged firm in this industry, had a $1.5 billion
      operating profit for its domestic tobacco business, and has over $4 billion in net assets
      from its Nabisco stock holdings. The only real risk of bankruptcy comes from losing a
      rash of lawsuits in court.

Today, President Clinton issued a strong statement calling for Congress to pass comprehensive,
bipartisan tobacco legislation to reduce teen smoking.

CLEAR FACTS, HIGH STAKES. 3,000 children begin to smoke every day; 1,000 of them will die
early as a result. President Clinton is committed to passing comprehensive bipartisan legislation
to stop young Americans from smoking before they start, by raising the price of cigarettes,
putting into place tough restrictions on advertising and access, imposing penalties on the industry
if it continues to sell cigarettes to children, and ensuring that the FDA has authority to regulate
tobacco products. That effort can save one million lives over the next five years.

A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE TOBACCO REFORM. Senator McCain and Senator
Hollings' tobacco legislation bill, which passed the Commerce Committee by a 19-1 vote three
weeks ago, is a strong step in the right direction on the road to passing comprehensive tobacco
legislation. It shows real momentum in both parties to pass effective, comprehensive
tobacco legislation this year.

STANDING STRONG FOR COMPREHENSIVE REFORM, NOT HALF MEASURES. In the days to
come, the tobacco industry will try to persuade Congress to pass weaker legislation, which
will not reduce teen smoking. We must continue to work with Senator McCain and others'
to ensure the kind of legislation that will succeed in dramatically reducing teen smoking.
This is no time to accept half-measures that will only play into the industry's hands.


Questions and Answers

Q:     What did the President think of Speaker Gingrich's statement this weekend
       criticizing the McCain bill? Do you think the Speaker has adopted the industry's
       line?

A:     The President was very disappointed in the Speaker's statement. The Speaker indicated
       that he wants to pursue half-measures, rather than a comprehensive approach that will do
       everything it takes to reduce youth smoking. We need a bill that's strong on price, that's
       strong on penalties, that's strong on advertising and access restrictions, and that's strong
       on FDA jurisdiction. Senator McCain's bill is a very strong step in that direction, and we
       hope Speaker Gingrich will rethink his position and decide to support such a
       comprehensive approach.

Q:     Isn't the President's plan -- and the McCain bill-- a big government, big tax
       proposal?
A:     No. What the President's approach does is to attack the problem of youth smoking

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
     differences with Senator McCain, he also recognizes the need to move forward on all
     these fronts to reduce youth smoking. That's not about big government. It's about
     sensible, bipartisan steps to dramatically reduce youth smoking.

Q.   But won't the McCain bill create 17 new federal bureaucracies?

A.   No -- this isn't about big government. That's just another Big Lie from Big Tobacco.
     What the bill does is to ensure that the federal government has the authority to regulate
     tobacco products in order to reduce youth smoking, as well as the ability to target tobacco
     revenues to strong public health and research efforts. The so-called "bureaucracies" that

     industry is criticizing these provisions now only because the political tide has turned
     against it, and certain other aspects of the legislation have gotten stronger.

Q:   Aren't the fees imposed by the Administration's plan and the McCain bill
     regressive?

A:   The tobacco industry has spent billions of dollars marketing to low-income and
     minorities, and made billions of dollars at their expense. Big Tobacco doesn't care about
     poor people -- it just wants to keep hooking future smokers. The Administration is
     committed to making sure cessation programs are available to help smokers quit -- and
     just as important, that we change the way the tobacco industry does business so it no
     longer preys on poor kids in the first place.

Q:   Isn't the licensing scheme that the Administration proposed a big government
     scheme that would extend the reach of the federal government to every mom-and-
     pop grocery store or 7-11?

A:   No. The Administration has offered proposals designed to reduce smuggling that would
     require wholesalers, distributors, and retailers to identify themselves as such. That's no
     more than what any business has to do now to sell liquor -- and no more than what most

     burdening retailers. The Administration will work with Congress, and the retailers

     you will.

                               THE WHITE HOUSE
                                  APRIL 26, 1998

        Anyone who has ever been a parent knows the absolute joy -- and the awesome
repsonsibility -- that comes with raising a child. We will do everything we can to keep our
children safe from harm -- from strapping on their seat belts in the car, to bundling them up
against the winter cold, to teaching them to say no to drugs.

       We accept that we cannot always predict all the challenges that may come our children's
way. But the dangers and consequences of tobacco are plain to all. The temptation to try
tobacco is one of the greatest threats our children face.

        That is why today's disturbing news -- that more and more minority teens are falling to
the tempation of cigarettes -- must galvanize our efforts to protect all our children from tobacco.
We all know that today's statistics are part ofa larger trend: Every day, 3,000 young people light
up their first cigarettes and become smokers for life. One thousand of them will die as a result.

        The cold hard facts are adding up. The call to action is getting louder. And time is
running out. Congress has just four weeks to pass a comprehensive bipartisan tobacco bill that
can help save the lives of millions of our children -- that will cut teen smoking by raising the
price of cigarettes, imposing strong penalties on tobacco companies who continue advertising to
children, and giving the FDA full authority to regulate children's access to tobacco products.

         Senator McCain's bill is a strong step in this direction. Make no mistake about it: The
legislation explicitly changes the rules of the game so that the tobacco industry can no longer do
what it has done for years -- profit at the expense of our children's health.

         It is time to end the delay. It seems as if we're in a situation where we know what the
illness is -- too many children lured to smoking by unscruplous, multi-million dollar advertising
campaigns that have targeted our youth for decades. We know that the cure is -- tough,
comprehensive bipartisan legislation to end these practices and cut teen smoking. And yet we're
hesitating. No parent who knows how to cure a sick child would stand by and do nothing. For
our children's sake, we must not walk away from this session of Congress without a
comprehensive tobacco bill.

         I don't want to tum this tobacco settlement into a political issue for the fall. I want an
achievement for this spring -- a bipartisan tobacco law that will open a new chapter in America's
efforts to protect the health of our children. Let us all work together to build a brighter future for
our children.
