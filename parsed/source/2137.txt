MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECf:                  McCain Legislation

         With the overwhelming vote in favor of the McCain legislation in the Senate Commerce
Committee and the subsequent announcement of the tobacco industry that it will fight this
legislation, we have entered into a new phase of our effort to procure a comprehensive tobacco
bill to reduce youth smoking. The Commerce Committee vote last week brought new
momentum to this ,legislative effort. The industry's response should only add to that momentum,
by making it even harder for Members of Congress to block legislation, lest they look as if they
are doing the industry's bidding.

         The broad consensus among your advisors is that we should seek a comprehensive bill to
which both the industry and the public health community ultimately can agree. (We all agree
that what the industry -- and also the public health community -- says now is probably not what
they will say in the future.) Without industry consent, some provisions in comprehensive
legislation (i.e., the most far-reaching advertising restrictions) would be impossible, while other
provisions (~, narrower advertising restrictions and lookback penalties) would be in litigation
for years. In any event, most of your advisors doubt that Congress would pass a bill that the
industry ultimately could not accept, so efforts to push the price of the bill that high would be
counterproductive. At the same time, we must make sufficient modifications to the McCain bill
to enable the public health community to claim some further victory.

        Your advisors also agree that the best way to get this kind of bill is to engage in
negotiations with Senators Lott, Daschle, McCain, and Hollings that are designed to produce an
agreed-upon bill to go to the Senate floor. The greatest danger we face is a chaotic situation on
the Senate floor, in which some amendments roll back what we already have achieved (~, on
FDA jurisdiction), while other amendments make the bill essentially unpassable (~, by
stripping all liability protections while increasing the overall price of the deal). To avoid this
danger, we should enter into a substantive agreement, which is mindful both of the industry's
needs and of the public health community's demands. Assuming Senator Hollings is in the
room, we should have a decent sense of the industry's bottom line, and of course we have more-
than-adequate lines of communication to the public health community.


                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
during these negotiations. Note that FDA jurisdiction does not appear on this list; we were able
to reach an agreement on this issue with Senators McCain and Frist, prior to the Commerce
Committee vote, that satisfies all our regulatory needs and objectives.

Youth Lookback Penalties

         We already have said that Congress must strengthen the lookback penalties in the McCain
legislation, by incorporating some company-specific penalties and raising the cap on the industry
surcharge. The incorporation of some company-specific penalties is a core demand of the public
health community, and is strongly supported by HHS and Treasury. Such penalties, however,
may be unacceptable to the industry, and especially to Phillip Morris because of its
disproportionately large share of the youth market. Bruce Lindsey has noted that even if we need
to make demands in this area, we should not let the issue of company-specific penalties become
grounds for vetoing the bill. We agree, but think it is important to try to find a way to address
this issue.

        A number of approaches are available, and we should not now tie ourselves down to any
of them. A company-specific penalty developed by Treasury and HHS would impose a $500 fee
for every child by which a company misses the targets (i.e., if a company misses the target by
10,000 children, it would pay a fee of $5,000,000). This per-child surcharge represents the
present value of the profits a company would gain from addicting a teenager over his lifetime.
Treasury estimates that the total cost of this penalty -- i.e., across all companies -- could reach as
much as $500 million. Another approach, probably more acceptable to the industry, would be
to allow suits between companies for redistribution of the industry-wide penalty. Such
indemnification suits would create a potential for transforming the industry surcharge into a
company-specific penalty scheme, without increasing the overall cost of the penalty provisions.
We will continue to try to develop creative solutions in this area so that we can enter negotiations
with a range of proposals.

       Raising the cap on industry-wide penalties is obviously an easier matter. We would
suggest proposing a change from the current $3.5 billion to $4 to $5 billion.

Price per Pack and Spending

Price per Pack

        We should not demand any increase in the McCain bill's funding levels in the first five
years, because McCain essentially adopted our own budget numbers (while adding a $10 billion
up-front payment). We recommend waiting until CBa scores the McCain bill before deciding
whether to seek any increase in funding levels in later years. (McCain has asked CBa to score



                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
yearly payments in the bill will increase the price of cigarettes not by the $1.10 we estimated, but
by the $1.50 that the public health community has most often demanded. The higher figure may
result from assumptions by the CBO that (1) states will use the opportunity to increase state
excise taxes, further reducing the number of packs sold and (2) the bill will significantly increase
the black market for cigarettes, resulting in fewer than expected packs sold through the legitimate
retail market. By reducing the number of expected packs sold, both of these changes would
increase the per-pack price estimate, because the annual industry payment set in legislation would
be spread among fewer packs. Once we know the actual per-pack price increase calculated by
Congressional scorekeepers, we will be in a better position to determine whether we should push
for a small increase in funding levels after the fifth year.

Spending

       We hope for bipartisan consensus on much ofthe spending: we think Members
could agree on approximately $10 billion over 5 years for farmers; $10 billion for
prevention, cessation, counteradvertising, FDA enforcement, and other public health
progranis; $10-15 billion for research (the Republicans may want to limit these funds to
NIH); and $20-25 billion for states. This distribution leaves about $15 billion on the table,
which Republicans will want to spend on Medicare or tax cuts and Democrats will want to
spend on programs like child care and school construction.

         One issue will concern the use of the state money. Our budget earmarked 57 percent of
the state funding for child care, class size, and Medicaid outreach initiatives. fu we go forward,
we should argue at a minimum for a menu of state programs, such as child care and education,
on which states would have to use a significant portion of their funds. For example, in the
Harkin-Chafee bill, half of the state funds must be spent on one of 20 listed programs, which
include child care, K-12 education, Medicaid, the Child Health Insurance Program, and Head
Start.

         Another issue, more important in the outyears, concerns the amount of money allocated
to paying legal judgments. The June 20th settlement put only a few billion dollars into the tort
fund in the first five years, on the theory that lawsuits against the industry would take some time
to come to judgment. Congress may well use the same assumption, given competing spending
priorities. But once this initial grace period is concluded, Congress must figure out how to fund
legal judgments. The June 20th settlement placed a $5 billion annual cap on judgments, with $4
billion coming from the industry's base payments to the government and $1 billion (a kind of
copayment) from the defendant companies' coffers. The McCain bill establishes a $6.5 billion
cap; McCain contemplated that $5.2 would come from the industry's base payments, with $1.3 as
a copayment, but his bill does not actually address this issue. Some in the public health world
may begin to call for the entire amount to be paid by the companies, outside of their payments


                                                 3
                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
  the deal and could doom prospects for legislation. Room for a tort fund thus will have to be
. found in the outyears by squeezing some of the spending (perhaps to the states?) listed above.


 Antitrust Exemption

         The McCain bill contains antitrust exemptions for the tobacco industry that are not
 necessary to achieve the goals of the legislation and may have serious anticompetitive effects. As
 written, the bill exempts any and all agreements designed to "reduce the use of tobacco products
 by underage individuals." This exemption could cover (among other things) price-fixing
 agreements of all sorts. The Department of Justice believes strongly, and we agree, that we
 should oppose all antitrust exemptions, except possibly for a narrowly-drawn exemption designed
 to allow companies to agree to restrict their advertising and marketing to children.

 International Tobacco Control Efforts

         As part of the public health spending noted above, we believe we should include
 significant funding ($200 million a year) for international tobacco control efforts. These funds
 should be spent on both governmental and non-governmental efforts to promote public health
 and smoking prevention efforts abroad.

           The McCain bill has several additional international provisions that we would like to
  change so that they do not interfere with our diplomatic and trade priorities. For example,
  although we support the bill's effort to prohibit u.s. government support for promotion of
  tobacco overseas, we need to ensure that the language does not interfere with USTR's ability to
  negotiate tariff reductions Or interfere with treatment of other products. In addition, the McCain
. bill contains a provision that the State Department and HHS consider problematic and
  unenforceable, which would require U.S. companies to abide by the new labeling and advertising
  requirements when doing business in other countries. Our positions on these issues coincide
  (coincidentally, of course) with the industry's, which views the McCain provisions as a real threat
  to its international operations.

 Environmental Tobacco Smoke

          The McCain bill would exempt the hospitality industry (restaurants, bars, casinos, etc.)
 from its environmental tobacco smoke provisions, which ban smoking, except in enclosed and
 specially ventilated areas, in public facilities. In addition, the bill would allow individual states to
 "opt out" of all of the provisions, even if the state had no ETS protections of its own. Although
 HHS strongly opposes the hospitality exception (workers in the hospitality industry face grave
 risks from second-hand smoke), we doubt it is politically feasible to remove it. We should,

                                                    4


                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
citizens without any protection from ETS. Alternatively, we might consider pushing the Harkin-
Chafee approach to this issue, which rather than imposing a ban would provide funds to States
that progressively reduce exposure to ETS.

Liability Provisions

        We believe the Administration should adhere to the basic structure of the liability
provisions in the McCain legislation. If we need to make these provisions a bit tougher, we
can try to raise the cap from the current $6.5 billion to the $8 billion contained in Harkin-
Chafee. Note, however, that doing so only compounds the budgetary issues surrounding
the tort fund noted earlier in this memo: to the extent that money for tort judgments come
from the industry's payments to the government, that money squeezes out funds for public
health and other priorities; conversely, to the extent that money for tort judgments comes
over and above the industry's payments to the government, the expected cost of the deal to
the industry increases.

        Finally, we may want to change the provisions in the McCain legislation that deny
the liability cap to certain companies. The current provision, which has received almost no
attention, lifts the cap for companies that miss the youth lookback target by more than 20
percentage points if they also have violated the Act or taken action to "undermine the
achievement of youth smoking reductions." Because of the vagueness of this standard, the
provision may have little or no effect. We should either tighten it (by linking the cap only
to objective measures) or discard it entirely. Especially if we try to make the liability
provisions tougher in other areas, agreeing to eliminate the provision may prove useful.

Constitutional Issues

        The Department of Justice is prepared to recommend changes to the advertising,
marketing, and other speech-related provisions of the legislation in the event that the industry
does not sign' protocols agreeing to these restrictions. The Department also would like us to
press for the elimination of all provisions regulating non-commercial speech, such as one that
forbids companies from lobbying Congress, regardless whether the companies offer agreement.

                                                                    Automated Records Management System

In summary, we would recommend seeking these improvements:

Youth Lookback Penalties

       Incorporate some company-specific component in the penalty scheme
       Increase the industry-wide surcharge cap from $3.5 billion to between $4 and $5 billion

Price and Spending

       No change in annual payment amounts in first five years; wait until CBO scores before
        deciding whether to seek later changes
       Ensure spending on research, public health, farmers, and (in the outyears) tort
        judgments); press for spending on child care and education, or at least a menu including
        these programs.

Antitrust Exemption

       Eliminate the antitrust exemption

International Tobacco Control

       Support funding for governmental and non-governmental organizations
       Narrow provision prohibiting U.S. support for promotion of tobacco overseas to ensure
        it does not interfere with USTR authority to negotiate treaties
       Remove requirement that companies must abide by new labeling and marketing
        requirements when operating overseas.

Environmental Tobacco Smoke

       Eliminate "opt-out" provision that allows states to adopt weaker laws

Liability

       Retain basic structure of liability priorities
       Consider modifying level of cap and relation of cap to youth reduction targets.
