                         will Dramatically Reduce Youth Smoking

The Commerce Committee manager's package contains significant improvements over the
underlying bill which will help to reduce youth smoking and to protect the public health. With
these improvements, the bill meets each of the President's principles for comprehensive tobacco
legislation. The improvements include:

Tougher Lookback Surcharges:

      The manager's amendment contains an uncapped company-specific surcharge of$l,OOO
       per youth smoker for every youth smoker by which the company misses its youth
       smoking targets. This surcharge represents twice the lifetime profits that a company
       earns from any youth smoker. The companies will not be able to pass these company-
       specific surcharges onto price, because any price differential between companies will
       dramatically affect their share of the adult market.

       At the levels specified in the manager's amendment, company specific surcharges will
       reduce profits by $640 million for every 10 points. The Treasury Department and OMB
       estimate that a 20-point miss in 2003 would represent one-third of total industry profits.
       By affecting their bottom line in this dramatic fashion, the company-specific surcharges
       in the manager's amendment will provide a significant incentive for tobacco companies
       to change their behavior and reduce sales to children.

      The manager's package also raises the cap on industry-wide lookback surcharges from
       $3.5 billion per year to $4 billion per year. The Treasury Department andOMB estimate
       that if targets are not met and the full $4 billion industry-wide surcharge is levied, the
       price of a pack of cigarettes will rise by about 35 cents.

Enhanced Environmental Tobacco Smoke Protections:

      The manager's package provides that a state can opt out of the national environmental
       tobacco smoke standard only if the state is able to demonstrate to OSHA that it has an
       ETS standard at least as protective of the public's health.

Spending:                             o

      The manager's package contains key provisions to fund important public health
       programs, health research, and assistance for farmers. It also provides funding to states to
       be used for a variety of programs, including child care.

      Approximately 22 percent of expected revenues from the legislation will go to fund
       research at Nlli, CDC, and AHCPR. Another 22 percent will fund smoking cessation
       programs, prevention and education programs, international tobacco control efforts, and a
       variety of enforcement efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize smuggling
       and crack down on retailers who sell tobacco products to children. All proceeds from
       lookback surcharges will go to prevention and education programs.


                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
      used for designated purposes -- the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the Safe
      and Drug-Free Schools Program, Eisenhower Grants, child welfare programs (Title IV-
      B), the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Title V Program, Substance Abuse grant
      programs, and a limited match for the Children's Health Insurance Program. This entire
      list is directed at the health and well-being of children and families most in need of
      assistance.

     The remainder of expected revenues from the legislation will go to protect tobacco
      farmers and to provide assistance to their communities, through the mechanisms of the
      LEAF Act.

     Excess revenues will go to the Medicare program.

Improved Liability Provisions:

     The manager's package ensures that the bill's liability provisions (i.e., the settlement of
      state lawsuits and the annual damages cap) apply only to companies that agree to accept
      sweeping advertising restrictions and to comply with important provisions ofthe law (i.e.,
      lookbacks and annual payments), even ifthose provisions are invalidated by the courts.

     The manager's package raises the annual liability cap from $6.5 to $8 billion (indexed for
      inflation), the same amount as the cap in the Chafee-Harkin bill. It also removes liability
      protections for parent companies and affiliates; ensures that the industry's attorneys will
      be subject to suit as under current law; and allows plaintiffs claiming injury from disease
      to use evidence of addiction in their lawsuits.

     The manager's package strengthens the provisions in the bill that link liability protections
      to the achievement of youth smoking targets. Under the amended legislation, a company
      that misses its targets by 20 percent or more has the burden of showing both that it did not
      engage in affirmative misconduct and that it used best efforts to reduce youth smoking in
      order to escape the loss of liability protections.

Elimination of Antitrust Exemption:

     The manager's package eliminates the blanket antitrust exemption contained in the
      underlying bill, which was not necessary to achieve the goals of the legislation and could
      have had anticompetitive effects.

     The manager's amendment will strengthen the anti-smuggling provisions in the bill, so as
      to prevent the emergence of contraband markets. The bill, as amended, will create a
      "closed distribution system" for tobacco products so that only licensed entities can sell or
      buy products; it will provide states with resources to establish or improve retail licensing
      systems; it will require manufacturers to mark packages for export to prevent their
      diversion; and it will establish and enforce strong penalties for violations. A very similar
      system has worked to control smuggling of alcoholic beverages for over sixty years.
                          Surcharge will Change Industry Behavior

        The uncapped company-by-company surcharge of$I,OOO per youth smoker contained in
the Commerce Committee manger's package will provide a significant incentive for tobacco
companies to change their behavior and reduce sales to children. Industrywide surcharges are
passed directly to price, and are designed to drive up the price to discourage teens from smoking.
 Company-specific surcharges are designed not to drive up the price of cigarettes, but to come
straight out of the companies' bottom line if they sell to children. Companies cannot pass
company-specific surcharges onto price, because any price differential between companies will
dramatically affect their share of the adult market.

      Without a company-specific surcharge, any company can still make a profit by selling to
       kids. The $1,000 per youth smoker surcharge contained in the manager's amendment
       will force a company to surrender twice the lifetime profits it makes from addicting a teen
       in the first place.

      This penalty is uncapped, and will take a large bite out of after-tax profits. The total
       after-tax profits of the domestic tobacco industry are $5 billion ($7.5 billion pre-tax). The
       Department of Treasury estimates that after-tax profits will drop to about $3.4 billion by
       2003 (in constant dollars) under the McCain bill. The company-specific surcharges
       reduce the companies profits by about $640 million for every 10 points. A 30-point miss
       would reduce profits by over $1.9 billion, which is more than half of projected profits. A
       60-point miss would reduce profits by $3.8 billion, which amounts to more than projected
       total profits.

      These penalties are large enough to prevent companies from being able to pass them onto
       price. Assume, for example, that the total volume of cigarettes sold in 2003 is 15 million
       packs (about halfway between CBO and OMB estimates). Because Philip Morris's
       market share is 50%, or 7.5 million packs, a 30-point miss would cost the company about
       $1.2 billion. rfPhilip Morris passed that amount along to price, it would have to raise the
       price of Marlboros by 16 cents a pack, or $1.60 a carton. A similar price differential
       between Philip Morris and RJR cigarettes in 1993 cost RJR so much of its adult market
       share that the company has never recovered.

      In addition, any company that misses its targets by more than 20% stands a significant
       chance of losing its liability protections altogether under the manager's amendment. As
       amended, the bill provides that a company that misses its targets by this amount has the
       burden of showing both that it did not engage in affirmative misconduct and that it used
       best efforts to reduce youth smoking in order to escape the loss of liability protections.

Opponents of lookback surcharges have argued that the Constitution -- principally, the
substantive component of the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee -- prohibits collection of
these surcharges unless the government:

      obtains company consent to the lookback regime, or

      exempts companies that have taken specified steps to discourage youth consumption of
       their products ..

We believe that lookback surcharges can be imposed without consent or without a system for
exempting companies who demonstrate that they took specified actions to reduce tobacco
consumption by minors.

Congress possesses broad authority to enact legislation adjusting the "burdens and benefits of
economic life"; the "burden is on the one complaining of a due process violation to establish that
the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way." Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co.,
428 U.S. 1, 15 (1976).

The McCain bill minimizes the risk of challenge by:

      Ensuring lookback provisions are primarily a mechanism for increasing prices in order to
       reduce underage demand and of generating revenues for programs to reduce underage
       smoking further and to combat its effects. lfthe government's purpose in imposing
       lookback surcharges is to increase prices and generate revenues, the refusal to permit an
       "innocent company" defense is plainly rational.

      Designing its provisions to make clear that altering tobacco company conduct is a
       secondary objective. lfthe government's primary purpose in imposing lookback
       surcharges was to induce tobacco companies to change their marketing and distribution
       practices, companies could plausibly (though we think incorrectly) argue that it is
       "arbitrary and irrational" to deny companies an opportunity to avoid surcharges by
       demonstrating that they took all reasonable steps to discourage youth consumption of
       their brands.
    as it primary objective, to alter company marketing and distribution practices ought to be
    sustained against a substantive due process challenge. Courts, under current doctrine,
    should accept the rationality of legislative judgments (1) that an innocent company
    defense would unduly undermine the deterrent effect of lookback incentives, or (2) that
    an innocent company defense should not be recognized because companies with
    excessive youth smoking rates could always do more, including imposing their own price
    increases, to reduce youth consumption. However, a constitutional defense along either
    of these lines would raise novel questions and we therefore believe that the risk of
    invalidation would be greater under this approach.

   Both company-specific and industry-wide surcharges can be imposed without consent.
    Company-specific surcharges would generate revenue (at the expense of those whose
    brands are used most heavily by minors) and might tend to increase price. Moreover,
    company-specific surcharges may be essential to the feasibility of the overall lookback
    scheme, since company-specific surcharges counter any incentive for individual
    companies to recruit new underage users at the expense of the entire industry. If
    company-specific lookback surcharges are designed to serve these purposes (and
    described accordingly), courts should not find that omission of an innocent company
    defense would render them arbitrary and irrational for purposes ofthe substantive due
    process doctrine.

                    Methodology in McCain Bill Improves Upon Settlement

The ability to accurately measure youth tobacco use is an integral part of an effective system of
reducing youth smoking.

The Commerce Committee Legislation contains a lookback surcharge system that is intended to
ensure that, in the event that other measures contained in this Act prove to be inadequate to
produce substantial reductions in tobacco use by minors, tobacco companies will pay additional
assessments designed to lower youth tobacco consumption in a variety of ways: by triggering
further increases in the price of tobacco products, by encouraging tobacco companies to work to
meet statutory targets for reductions in youth tobacco consumption, and providing support for
further reduction efforts.

As part of this system, there would be an annual survey of young people to determine the
percentage that use cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. To be sure that any surcharge liability is
fairly measured and not open to dispute, the Commerce Committee Legislation proposes that a
new survey be conducted that would be far more accurate than current surveys that attempt to
measure youth tobacco use.

As part of its June Settlement with the States Attorneys General, the tobacco industry agreed to a
system of lookback surcharges where the industry'S progress would be measured by a survey
conducted at the University of Michigan called "Monitoring the Future." While this survey
provides important data about youth tobacco use, it is not sufficient to serve as the basis of an
effective lookback system.

      Because of low participation rates among schools, the results from the Michigan survey
       are much less reliable than those that would be produced by the survey contained in
       Commerce Committee Legislation.

      Because only a portion of the overall sample of the Michigan survey is used to measure
       cigarette use by brand, precise estimates of the number of youth people that use each
       manufacturer's brands of cigarettes are not possible. In addition, the Michigan survey
       does not collect brand data on smokeless tobacco use. The Commerce Committee
       Legislation will permit precise estimates of the number of young people that use each
       manufacturer's brands of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.

      The survey contained in the Commerce Committee Legislation would use proven
       methodologies, such as computer-assisted technology, which increase respondent privacy
       and confidentiality. The Michigan survey does not employ such methods.

The public health community believes that youth tobacco use should be measured based on
tobacco use within the last month. This is an appropriate standard that captures a significant
amount of youth tobacco use that occurs on a routine, but not daily, basis.

      Data on youth tobacco use indicate that a significant percentage of youths who are
       occasional users will become addicted smokers, some while they are still teens and others
       in early adulthood.

      Surveys indicate that about 30% of 12-17 year olds who smoked just 2-9 times in the
       previous 30 days had become everyday smokers 4 years later.

Ifwe fail to capture these patterns of use when we measure youth tobacco use, the tobacco
companies would have little incentive to discourage experimentation and occasional use.

In fact, the tobacco industry may find ways to game the system by targeting their ads in ways that
encourage occasional use by older teens on the assumption that these teens will not progress to
daily use until after age 17. The industry has demonstrated quite well its ability to target ads to
segments of the youth market.
       Funds Critical Public Health, Health Research, Farmers, and State Programs

The Commerce Committee's manager's package funds critical funding for public health, health
research, farmers and farming communities, and states, including significant funds for child care.

Public Health Programs: 22 percent of funds (about $14 billion/S years)

The bill funds critical public health programs, including tobacco prevention and education
programs, cessation programs, counter-advertising, Indian health services, international tobacco
control efforts, and a variety of enforcement efforts at both the federal and state levels to
minimize smuggling and crack down on retailers who sell tobacco products to children.

Health Research Programs: 22 percent of funds (about $14 billion/S years)

The bill provides 22 percent of funds for research at the National Institutes of Health, the
National Science Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research .. The bill would also fund a demonstration to permit Medicare beneficiaries
to participate in certain federally sponsored cancer clinical trials.

Farmers and Communities: 16 percent offunds (about $10 billion/S years)

The bill provides 16 percent offunds to assist the transition of both flue-cured and burley
tobacco growers and their communities. The bill contains $28.5 billion for tobacco farmers and
their communities over 25 years, including payments for lost tobacco quota; payments for sale of
quotas; payments for community economic development block grants; a worker transition
program; and higher education assistance programs.

Grants to States: 40 percent of funds (about $26 billion/S years)

Recognizing the important role states have played in enabling this legislation, the manager's
amendment provides that 40 percent of funds be transferred to the states, $196.5 billion over 25
years, with half unrestricted and half to be used for designated programs for the health and well-
being of children and families most in need:

              Child Care and Development Block Grant
              Maternal and Child Health Block Grant
              Child welfare (Title IV -B)
              Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration grants
              Safe and Drug-Free Schools
              Professional Development (Eisenhower) grants
              Match for the Children's Health Insurance Program (limited to 6 percent of
              restricted funds)

If states were to spend their restricted funding in proportion to current federal expenditures, and
use 6% for the Children's Health Insurance Program, at least 40% of the funds, or over $5 billion
over five years, would go to child care.
Medicare: Additional Revenues
directed to the Medicare HI Trust Fund.
                               the Scope of Liability Protections
                                   for the Tobacco Industry

Senator McCain's Manager's Amendment contains key improvements in the bill's civil liability
provisions. As amended, the bill establishes a higher, $8-billion-per-year cap on damages, which
will be available only to tobacco companies that finally change the way they do business by
agreeing to restrict advertising to youth and abide by the terms of the legislation rather than tying
it up in court. The new version of the bill also removes special protections for parent companies
of tobacco manufacturers.

The Manager's Amendment significantly improves on the bill reported out of the
Commerce Committee by:

      Ensuring that the bill's liability provisions -- i.e., the settlement of state lawsuits and the
       annual damages cap -- apply only to companies that agree to accept sweeping advertising
       restrictions and to comply with the key terms of the law, even if those provisions are
       struck down;

      Raising the annual liability cap from $6.5 billion to $8 billion (the same amount as in the
       Chafee-Harkin-Graham bill), with all damage judgments to be paid by the industry;

      Strengthening the provisions in the bill that link liability protections to the achievement
       of youth smoking targets, by removing liability protections from a company that misses
       its targets by 20 percent or more unless it proves that it used best efforts to reduce youth
       smoking;

      Permitting suits against parent companies and affiliates of tobacco manufacturers, as well
       as their attorneys;

      Ensuring that individuals with tobacco-related disease can use evidence of their addiction
       in suits against tobacco companies; and

      Ensuring that tobacco companies cannot escape their obligations by making fraudulent
       transfers or declaring bankruptcy.

Moreover, the Manager's Package retains important features of the bill reported out of
Committee:

      The bill contains no limits on class action lawsuits and does not limit the amount that
       anyone can recover from a tobacco company; and

      The bill assists plaintiffs who have minimal resources in suing big tobacco companies by
       recognizing two well established facts -- that nicotine is addictive, and that the use of
       tobacco causes a wide array of diseases.
                        Contains Tough Anti-Smuggling Provisions


The Commerce Committee manager's package creates a strong licensing and enforcement system
that will minimize smuggling by creating a closed distribution system for tobacco products,
labeling all products for export, and imposing tough penalties on manufacturers and other firms
involved in smuggling.

An Effective Licensing System is the Key to a Closed Distribution System: To prevent black
market activity, the manager's package regulates tobacco products in a manner similar to the way
the federal government has regulated alcoholic beverages for over 60 years.

Under this closed distribution system, only manufacturers, wholesalers, exporters, importers, and
distributors that hold a federal license would be allowed to engage in those businesses. Licenses
would be issued based on certain specified criteria and could be revoked or suspended for certain
specified violations. Those conducting business without a permit would be subject to civil
monetary penalties of up to $10,000 per offense, a prison term of up to five years, and property
forfeiture. Tobacco companies implicated in smuggling would lose their liability protections.
Licensed entities would be authorized to sell tobacco products only to other licensed entities.
Licensing of retailers would be done by the states.

Additionally, all tobacco produc~ packages would be marked with a serial number to facilitate
tracking, and all exported packages will be labeled FOR EXPORT FROM THE UNITED
STATES to prevent them from being smuggled back into the U.S. and sold illegally.

A Closed Distribution System will Prevent Black Market Activity: A closed distribution system
will ensure that products moving outside the legal channels of distribution can be easily
earmarked and targeted for prosecution. This system would drastically limit smugglers' ability to
enter products into a legitimate distribution channel. Potential black marketeers would not be
able to move products through legitimate wholesalers or distributors. Nor would they be able to
sell products to retail consumers at local convenience stores or other licensed retail outlets.
Instead, without a way to place contraband in the market legally, smugglers would have to sell
cigarettes outside channels of legitimate distribution. This would be very risky and criminal
provisions and penalties would act as a significant deterrent to persons contemplating the
unlawful diversion of tobacco products.

Fun ding for Enforcement: The manager's amendment authorizes funding for anti-smuggling
enforcement as part of the public health spending account and enables the Secretary of the
Treasury to collect fees to cover enforcement costs.
                                 will Not Cause Bankruptcy

Claims by the tobacco companies that the McCain bill will drive them into bankruptcy are not
convincing for two key reasons. First, the legislation is designed to facilitate the pass-through of
manufacturer payments to the prices of tobacco products, minimizing the impacts on the profits
of the manufacturers themselves. Second, the industry has a significant cash flow and net assets
to absorb the reduced volume as prices rise.

The Payments are Made by Tobacco Consumers, Not Tobacco Manufacturers: The primary
goal of comprehensive tobacco legislation is to reduce youth tobacco use. The single most
effective means of accomplishing this goal is to raise the price of tobacco products. As a result,
the McCain legislation and other bills facilitate the pass-through of industry payments to the
price of tobacco products. Mechanisms such as the allocation of industry payments by market
share, and volume adjustments which reduce industry payments as volumes fall, will ensure that
these payments are made by consumers, not manufacturers.

Payments Made by Tobacco Consumers Have Modest Impact on Manufacturer Profitability:
The opinion of the objective experts at the Federal Trade Commission is that even large price
increases will have little impact on profits: They find that the AG settlement, which raised prices
by 62 cents, lowered the profitability of the tobacco industry by only about 15%. By their
method, the $1.10 price increase in the McCain bill would lower profitability by less than 25%.

The Tobacco Industry Has Substantial Financial Resources: The U.S. tobacco industry is
large, well-diversified, and financially strong; the operating earnings for the top five tobacco
manufacturers was $23.6 billion. The industry leader, Philip Morris, is particularly well
positioned to absorb decreases in their domestic tobacco earnings:

      Their stock is currently valued at almost $100 billion.
      They had $4.7 billionin domestic tobacco operating profits in 1997.
      They also had operating profits of $4.6 billion on their international tobacco business.
      They are also a well diversified company that has operating profits of almost $5 billion
       from other lines of business such as food and beer.

Even the most vulnerable in this industry, RJR Nabisco, has substantial financial resources:

      For 1997, RJR Nabisco's domestic tobacco business had operating profits of$1.5 billion
      The company also has a rapidly growing international business which had $670 million in
       operating profits in 1997.
      In addition to their tobacco businesses, RJR Nabisco has a substantial asset: its holdings
       of 80 percent of Nabisco, valued at almost $10 billion dollars. This exceeds by $5 billion
       the company's outstanding debt (excluding Nabisco).
                           Substantially Reduce Youth Smoking and
                                  Prevent Premature Death

The single most important step we can take to reduce youth smoking is to raise the price of a
pack of cigarettes significantly. The Treasury Department analysis has found that the $1.10 price
increase in the McCain bill will, by itself, reduce youth smoking by 32% in 2003. Taken in
conjunction with a conservative estimate of the impact of the other non-price provisions in the
legislation, such as access and marketing restrictions, the overall impact is an average 42%
reduction in youth smoking and premature deaths in every state.

Why do we need to significantly increase the price of cigarettes to prevent youth smoking?

According to the Treasury Department, the per-pack price increase in the McCain bill combined
with advertising and access restrictions will result in an average reduction of 42 percent in
underage teenage smoking in the year 2003. The percentage reductions in underage teen
smoking and resulting premature deaths range from 33-36 percent in states like Washington,
Massachusetts, and Michigan, to 47-51 percent in states like Wyoming, Tennessee, and
Kentucky. Fifteen states will see reductions above 45 percent in 2003.

Over the next five years, the number of young people kept from smoking would be about 3
million young people for the country as a whole. Individual states will see reductions ranging
from a few thousand in the smaller states up to about 248,000 in California and 205,000 in
Texas. And about a million young people will be saved from premature death, including 56,000
in Florida, 57,000 in Ohio, 37,000 in Michigan, 83,000 in California, and 24,000 in Missouri.

Can one million lives really be saved over 5 years if Congress passes comprehensive
legislation?

The Treasury Department's analysis shows that the McCain bill's price increase of $1.1 0 per
pack over five years coupled with sales and advertising restrictions will reduce underage smoking
by nearly half, stopping 3 million teens from smoking and saving a million lives over the next
five years. This analysis includes a conservative estimate that advertising and access provisions
will reduce teen smoking by 15 percent. The rest ofthe reduction is attributable to the price
mcrease.

Don't some experts say a price increase will have no effect on young people's behavior?

In fact, there is a substantial consensus in the economics literature that price increases have a
dramatic impact on youth smoking. The model used by the Treasury Department reflects that
consensus. Indeed, an independent analysis from the Congressional Budget Office recently
reviewed the literature and concluded that youth smoking is very responsive to price.

Again, the clear consensus of the U.S. literature, as confirmed by CBO, is that youths are very
responsive to price in their decisions to smoke. International comparisons are much less
informative for the response of youths in the U.S. to price changes. If one insists on international
comparisons, perhaps the best one to use is Canada, were a doubling of the price of cigarettes
over the 1981 to 1991 period led to a 50% fall in youth smoking -- almost exactly what would
have been predicted by Treasury's model.


The Treasury Model

      The Treasury model of youth smoking starts from a participation elasticity of -0.7 at the
       current price level of about $1.95 - which means that a 10% increase in price above its
       current level would reduce the number ofteen smokers by 7%.

      But this relationship only holds for very small price changes. For larger and larger price
       increases, the Treasury model predicts somewhat smaller proportional reductions in teen
       smoking. This reflects the fact that the teens most likely to respond to price signals are
       also the first to be discouraged from smoking by a price increase.

      Using this model, a $1.1 0 increase in the real price of cigarettes is projected to reduce
       youth smoking by 32%. Since a $1.10 increase in the real price in 2003 represents a 53%
       rise, the associated "average" elasticity is actually -0.6.'


Previous Academic Studies

      A number of studies have attempted to estimate the responsiveness of youth smoking in
       the U.S. to price changes - the pary:icipation elasticity, or the change in the number of
       teen smokers due to price changes. This literature is based on comparisons of youth
       smoking rates in high and low tax states, and on changes in youth smoking within states
       as tax rates change.

      The CBO recently summarized this literature by stating that most of the evidence points
       to participation elasticities ranging from -0.50 to -0.75. The Treasury estimate is in the
       range used by the CBO.

      The results from this literature are shown in the Table below. Because differences in
       elasticity estimates may be less intuitive, the table shows - for each analysis of youth
       smoking - the projected reduction in teen smokers from a $1.10 price increase (along
       with the Treasury estimates). This approach recognizes the fact that the Treasury model
       allows the elasticity to decline for larger price increases.




        'The semi-logarithmic demand function underlying this analysis is based on a standard
model used to predict overall cigarette demand. Under it, every dime ($0.10) increase in price
reduces demand by the same percent, but since it is doing so from a smaller and smaller base at
each step, the absolute reduction in teen smoking from each 10 cent increment declines slightly.

    Grossman et a1. (1983)                                                41%

    Wasserman et a1. (1991)                                               0-9%




        It is clear that the Treasury estimate is within the range of professional consensus on this
         question. Indeed, our estimates are more conservative than what most of the recent work
         in this area would suggest.

        One study which estimates a very different response from the remainder of the literature
         (Wasserman et a1.) focuses exclusively on the late 1970s. During this period some
         surveys indicate that youth smoking fell precipitously without a price increase. We
         believe a more appropriate interpretation of the data during the late 1970s is that youth
         smoking was driven down by the broader dissemination of facts about smoking's dangers.
          According to one major survey, only half of 12th graders saw a great risk in smoking a
         pack or more of cigarettes a day in 1975 - the lowest level in the survey - but this
         number increased by nearly 25% between 1975 and 1980. Thus, rather than indicating
         that price does not affect youth smoking, we believe this data shows that other things can
         influence teens in addition to price.

        This same problem has led to a misinterpretation by some of the Evans and Huang paper.
         As Professor William Evans of Maryland pointed out in a recent letter to the Commerce
         Committee, the findings of his paper have been misquoted. As noted in the Table above,
         the estimate that Evans stands behind is very close to the Administration estimate. The
         confusion over his findings arises from the fact that his estimates which include data from
         the late 1970s show a smaller youth elasticity than his estimates which focus on the 1980s
         and 1990s. As Prof. Evans has noted, however, the data are less reliable for this earlier
         period; in addition, as noted above, this was an era when non-price factors were driving
         teen smoking down in the face of constant prices.

          Some have cited the recent study by DeCicca et al. as refuting the previous literature. In
           fact, this study finds higher estimates than the remainder ofthe literature when standard
           estimation techniques are used on their full sample ofSth-12th graders. 2

          The study does find smaller effects when they choose the particular sample of 12th
           graders who weren't smoking in Sth grade, and try to model whether they start smoking.
           But there is no obvious explanation for this anomalous result; after all, removing from
           their model a population that is more addicted to cigarettes - individuals smoking from
           Sth to 12th grade - should raise, not lower, the elasticity estimate. It is troubling that
           dropping only5% of their sample -" the 5% of teens that are most addicted - reduces
           theiI: estimate so dramatically.

          The likely explanation for this anomalous finding is problems with their empirical
           methodology. A recent re-analysis of their data by Professors Thomas Dee of Georgia
           Tech and William Evans of Maryland has found these results to be very sensitive to the
           particular sample restrictions imposed by the Cornell authors. As these experts note,
           "The results appear to be purely an artifact of the way that the authors constructed the
           analysis sample". When a broader sample of observations is used, there is a very
           significant effect of taxes on youth smoking in their onset model- indeed, the results are
           quite comparable to the previous literature.

          This partly explains why the results of the Cornell study are so statistically imprecise.
           For example, in this particular model, they estimate that a $1.10 price rise would reduce
           smoking onset by only 7%. However, given the level of statistical imprecision in their
           model, their findings would be equally consistent with a reduction in youth onset of 50%
           or more from this $1.10 price increase - a range which encompasses the Treasury
           estimate, as well as their own estimates using a more straightforward methodology.

      One criticism levied by DeCicca et al. against the earlier literature is that it does not
       control for differences across states at a point in time that might determine youth smoking
       propensities; low tax states may have high smoking because of other regulatory or
       cultural factors. But their approach does not solve this problem; it still relies on point-in-
       time comparisons of smoking onset across states, making it difficult to separate out other
       differences across those states. Other studies address this problem much more directly.
       Chaloupka and Grossman (1996) do so by including a variety of state characteristics,
       including state anti-tobacco regulations. Evans and Huang (1997) address the problem
       even more directly by examining only the effect of within-state price changes on youth
       smoking. The fact that these estimates are so similar to that used by Treasury highlights
       the robustness of the conclusions, and indicates why the previous scientific consensus is
       not undermined by one set of anomalous results.

International Evidence

       2The     estimate cited in our Table is an average of their elasticities for Sth, 10th, and 12th
graders.
    high in other countries with much higher cigarette prices. In particular, Wall Street
    analyst Martin Feldman noted in his testimony of March 19th that youth smoking rose in
    the UK. between 1988 and 1996, despite a 26% rise in the real price of cigarettes. The
    inference that is often drawn from this type of evidence is that higher prices won't deter
    youth smoking in the US.

   But these international comparisons do not tell us much of anything about the response
    ofyouth in the u.s. to price changes. The fact that youth smoking rates remain high in
    other countries reflects other cultural factors that influence youth to smoke, and is not a
    rejection of the fundamental relationship between price and demand. And increased.
    smoking among youth in the u.K. between 1988 and 1996 may have more to do with
    other factors, such as a recession which raised youth unemployment rates by 25% over
    this period, than with changes in the price of cigarettes.

   In light of this concern, it is certainly preferable to rely on careful, controlled analysis of
    US. teen smoking than on this' type of anecdotal international evidence.

   Nevertheless, if one is going to make international comparisons, then the most
    appropriate one would be to Canada, since it is more similar to and faces many of the
    same cultural influences as the US. The two economic studies which estimate the effects
    of cigarette prices on Canadian teens are both consistent with the findings in the U.S.
    literature - teens are not only responsive to price changes, but they are more responsive
    than adults. In fact, the Canadian youth elasticity estimates are higher than those for the
    US.

   Moreover, the pattern of youth smoking in Canada confirms the sensitivity of youth to
    price changes. In 1981, Canada had a youth smoking rate that was about 50% higher than
    that in the US. Over the next decade, Canada raised its cigarette prices by over lOO%,
    and teen smoking fell by almost half. During this period there were no substantial
    change in teen smoking rates in the US., so by 1991 Canada's teen smoking rate was
    lower than ours. The implied Canadian elasticity of -0.42 is very close to the estimate
    that would be computed by the Treasury model (which allows the price responsiveness to
    fall as the magnitude of the price increase grows) for this large a price rise, which is an
    elasticity of -0.48.

   Teen smoking then rose again in Canada between 1991 and 1994, as Canada lowered
    dramatically its federal excise taxes. Of course, teen smoking was on the rise in the US.
    over this period as well, so it is not as easy to attribute all of the rise in Canada over this
    time period to price impacts. But the fact remains that for the country most comparable
    to the u.s., teen smoking rates fell as prices rose, and rose as prices fell.
                            Advertising and Marketing to Children

By reaffinning the full authority of the FDA to regulate tobacco products, S.1415 will prevent the
tobacco industry from advertising and marketing to children, and establish tough access
restrictions on tobacco products to stop sales to children.

Reaffirms 1996 Rule: Many of the measures to reduce teen smoking and protect the public
health contained in S.14l5 are in the 1996 FDA rule, but have not yet gone into effect because of
pending litigation. The bill would put these provisions into effect immediately, protecting
American children from the dangers of smoking. These provisions include: 1) banning outdoor
advertising within 1000 feet of schools and playgrounds; 2) restricting advertising to black-and-
white text only except in adult only facilities or publications with predominantly adult
readership; 3) prohibiting the sale or giveaway of promotional products with brand names or
logos; 4) prohibiting brand-name sponsorship of sporting or entertainment events; 5) setting the
minimum age for purchase of tobacco products at 18 years and requiring age verification for
anyone age under 27.

Creates a Separate Chapter for Regulating Tobacco: S.1415 creates a separate chapter in the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that gives the FDA explicit authority over access to and
advertising of tobacco products, in order to ensure thatFDA regulation of tobacco does not
impinge on the regulation of other products.

Establishes New Standardfor Regulating Tobacco: Instead of requiring tobacco products to
meet the traditional safety and efficacy standard required of drugs and devices, S.1415 imposes a
new standard which would require FDA regulation of tobacco products to be "appropriate for the
protection of public health". This standard better meets the characteristics of tobacco products
and allows the FDA to take the addiction of over 40 million Americans into account in making
decisions about how to regulate these products.

Provides Necessary Flexibility: Full FDA authority to regulate tobacco products provides the
agency with thc flexibility it needs to protect the public health. However, any FDA effort to
eliminate any particular class of tobacco products or eliminate nicotine cannot go into effect for
two years in order to provide Congress with an opportunity to weigh in and vote on the measure.

Preserves State and Local Authority: S.141S makes clear that except as expressly provided,
states and localities may adopt and enforce tobacco product requirements that are in addition to,
or more stringent than, requirements established under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for
tobacco products.

Provides Full Enforcement Authority: S.1415 provides for the same civil and criminal penalties
that the agency may use in enforcing device law.

     Overview of FDA Provisions: S. 1415 creates a separate chapter in the FDCA that
      explicitly gives FDA authority over access to and advertising of tobacco products. In
      nearly all respects this authority is comparable to the authority that FDA asserted in its
      1996 rule, which asserted FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products on the ground that
      nicotine is an addictive drug and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are
      combination drug/device products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
      (FDCA). S.14l5, however, created a separate chapter in order to respond to concerns
      raised by medical device companies that tobacco statutory interpretations and other
      policies issued under the device provisions of the FDCA could adversely affect those
      compames.

      The most significant difference between S. 1415 and current law is the standard that
      products must meet in order to be marketed. Under current law the standard is
      "reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness." This standard obviously does not fit
      tobacco products because tobacco products are inherently unsafe. Therefore, S. 1414
      adopts the standard of "appropriate for the protection of the public health," which allows
      FDA to take into account the fact that over 40 million Americans are addicted to tobacco
      in making decisions about how to regulate the product.

     1996 FDA Tobacco Rule in Effect: S. 1415 provides that the tobacco regulation that
      FDA finalized in 1996 will remain in effect as though it were issued under the new law.
      Because the effective date of certain portions of the regulation has been delayed due to
      the industry's judicial challenge to the rule, the bill would authorize FDA to establish
      effective dates for those provisions not yet in effect.

     Access Restrictions: S. 1415 authorizes FDA to establish restrictions on the sale or
      distribution of tobacco products. By affirming the 1996 rule's access restrictions, the bill
      sets the minimum age of purchase at 18 years; requires age verification by photo ill for
      anyone 26 or younger; requires face-to-face sales (except for mail order sales); bans
      vending machines and self-service displays except in facilities where only adults are
      permitted; prohibits the sales of single cigarettes or "loosies"; bans free samples; and sets
      the minimum package size at 20 cigarettes. However, S. 1415 constrains FDA from
      prohibiting the sale of tobacco products in face-to-face transactions by specific categories
      of retail stores (such as a ban on sale of cigarettes by gas stations).

     Advertising Restrictions and Warning Labels: S. 1415 expressly authorizes FDA to
      establish restrictions related to the advertising and promotion of a tobacco product. By
      affirming the 1996 rule's advertising restrictions, the bill bans outdoor advertising within
      1000 feet of schools and public playgrounds; restricts advertising to black-and-white text
      only (pUblications, outdoor, point of purchase, direct mail, etc.), except in publications
      with a predominant adult readership or at adult only facilities; prohibits the sale or
      giveaways of products like caps or gym bags that carry cigarette or smokeless tobacco
      product brand names or logos; and prohibits brand-name sponsorship of sporting or
      entertainment events, but permits it in the corporate name.

      S. 1415 also requires stronger and larger warning labels than existing law on tobacco
    modify the text, format, and type size requirements of these statements.

   Submission of Health Information to the Secretary: S. 1415 requires tobacco product
    manufacturers and importers, within 6 months of enactment (and annually thereafter), to
    submit to FDA specific categories of information relevant to FDA regulation oftobacco
    products.

   Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements: Authorizes FDA to issue regulations
    requiring that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the
    manufacture, ofa tobacco product conform to good manufacturing practice (GMPs). The
    bill also makes explicit that the Secretary has the authority to grant eithettemporary or
    permanent exemptions or variances from a GMP requirement.

   Performance Standards: S. 1415 confirms FDA's authority to issue standards for
    tobacco for tobacco products (for example limiting the amount of certain ingredients) if
    FDA determines that a standard is appropriate for protection of the public health. This
    authority is the same as that for devices.

           In issuing a performance standard, FDA must consider the health effects on
           tobacco users as well as potential users (such as children).

           In order to give Congress a chance to vote on any standard that eliminates all
           cigarettes, all smokeless tobacco products, or any similar class of tobacco
           products, or requires the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero,
           such a standard will not go into effect until two years after the President has
           notified Congress of such a standard.

   Testing and Reporting of Tobacco Smoke Constituents: S. 1415 directs the Secretary
    to issue regulations to require the testing, reporting, and disclosure of tobacco smoke
    constituents (e.g., tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide) and ingredients that "the Secretary
    determines should be disclosed to the public in order to protect the public health."

   Reduced Risk Tobacco Products: S. 1415 contains a provision that allows FDA to
    designate a product as a "reduced risk tobacco product" if it finds that "the product will
    significantly reduce harm to individuals caused by a tobacco product and is otherwise
    appropriate to protect the public health."
    expressly provided, states and localities may adopt and enforce tobacco product
    requirements that are in addition to, or more stringent than, requirements established
    under FDCA for tobacco products.

           State and local requirements related to access and advertising are not preempted
           by the FDCA.

           State and local requirements related to performance standards, good
           manufacturing practices, and other similar FDCA requirements, are preempted,
           but States and localities may apply for exemptions pursuant to procedures that
           parallel provisions in device law.

           S.1415 modifies the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act in order to
           ensure that restrictions on advertising imposed under State laws are not
           preempted.

   Full Enforcement Authority: S. 1415 provides for the same civil and criminal penalties
    that the agency may use in enforcing the device law. The bill also provides that FDA may
    issue, after an administrative hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, a no tobacco
    sale order prohibiting the sale of tobacco products at a particular retail outlet based on
    repeated violations by that outlet. The bill also imposes the same requirements for the
    export of tobacco products that do not meet the requirements of the FDCA that apply to
    devices.
                APPROPRIATELY PLACED AT FDA

   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the leading public health agency with
    authority to protect public health and to provide regulatory oversight of products
    that affect the human body, such as foods, drugs, and medical devices.

    ~      There are other federal public health agencies and there are other federal
           regulatory agencies. But FDA is the only agency that has extensive
           experience in both areas. This experience, combined with its recent
           development of the tobacco access and advertising regulations, makes it the
           only federal agency that can hit the ground running to implement the
           regulatory program to combat youth tobacco use in S. 1415.

   Under S. 1415, tobacco products fit appropriately into the regulatory framework
    that FDA has had in place for over sixty years.

   The scientific and regulatory expertise that resides within FDA is uniquely suited
    to provide the oversight that will be needed to protect the public health from the
    hazards of nicotine products. FDA's medical experts already evaluate and approve
    nicotine replacement drug and device products. In addition, regulatory offices
    within the agency are experienced in industry-wide product regulation.

   FDA's enforcement authorities, which S. 1415 expressly extends to tobacco
    products, are essential in order to protect public health. Enforcement actions are
    necessary to ensure that manufacturers and retailers comply with requirements
    such as those in the final rule issued in 1996 to protect young people from the
    hazards of tobacco products, and to protect the public from future violations.

   A distinctive feature of FDA's regulatory authority is the flexibility inherent in the
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and in the new provisions added to that
    Act by S. 1415, that enable FDA to swiftly and effectively address problems linked
    to the products for which it is responsible. As tobacco companies design new
    marketing campaigns or develop new products, FDA has a great amount of
    flexibility to respond to industry actions that could harm public health.

    Under the FDA rule, a retailer must not sell cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to
     anyone under 18. Therefore, purchasers must be 18 or older.

    Under the FDA rule, retailers must require customers under the age of 27 to
     present a photo ID (any photo ID with a birth date is acceptable).

     ~      FDA's rule contains this requirement because the evidence compiled by the
            agency during its rulemaking showed that it is very difficult to judge the age
            of many teenagers and young adults simply from their appearance, partly
            because young people mature at different rates. To ensure that
            older-looking teenagers are asked for ID, it makes sense to set the
            requirement to check identification somewhere above 18.

           FDA's requirement is consistent with a report prepared 'by twenty-six State
           Attorneys General recommending that the age for photo ID should be
           significantly higher than the minimum age of sale.

           In addition, materials developed and distributed to retailers by the tobacco
           industry and leading retailer organizations specifically recommended that
           retailers card anyone who appears to be under 26.

    Under the FDA rule, a retailer is not required to check the ID's of regular
     customers who are known to be at least 18 years old every time they buy tobacco
     products. Retailers must check a customer's photo ID at least once to ensure that
     the customer is at least 18 years old.                                      .
         TO REVIEW ANY FDA DECISION TO ELIMINATE NICOTINE
                    OR A CLASS OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS

   Because of the importance of any decision by FDA to eliminate all cigarettes, all
    smokeless tobacco products, or any similar class oftobacco products, or to require the
    reduction of nicotine yields to of a tobacco product to zero, S. 1415 recognizes that it is
    appropriate for Congress to have the opportunity to review such a decision and enact
    legislation to override it.

   S. 1415 recognizes this by requiring that FDA may not begin implementing any such
    standard until at least two years after the President notifies Congress that a final
    regulation imposing the restriction has been issued.

   S. 1415's provision ensures that Congress will have sufficient time and opportunity to
    review the standard and, if desired, vote on whether the standard should be rejected.

   FDA has no plans to use this authority, but scientific developments in the future may
    make its use appropriate.

   FDA has demonstrated that it would administer its authority to eliminate nicotine
    reasonably.

    >-     Although FDA had the authority to reduce or eliminate nicotine at the time it
           issued its tobacco regulations, the agency did not do so, because, among other
           reasons, there was not a sufficient scientific basis to conclude that reducing or
           eliminating nicotine from tobacco products would reduce tobacco use.

           FDA's refusal to ban cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products was based in part
           on the significant weight the agency accorded to the risks that a black market
           would be created and that addicted tobacco users would suffer as a result of
           sudden withdrawal from nicotine-containing products.

           FDA is required under S.1415 to take these same factors into account in
           promulgating any standard eliminating nicotine from tobacco products.

    S. 1415 imposes many procedural requirements on FDA before the agency can issue a
    ,Performance standard eliminating nicotine from tobacco products.

    >-     FDA must issue a notice of proposed rulemaking, containing a finding with
           supporting justification that the performance standard is appropriate for protection
           of the public health.

           The notice must contain proposed findings with respect to the risk of illness or
           injury that the standard is intended to address.
           standard.

           FDA must invite participation from informed persons, including industry
           representatives ..

           FDA must consider the risks to the health of tobacco users and non-users from
           elimination of nicotine, including the risk that a black market will be created.

           FDA must, at the request of an interested party, refer the proposed standard to an
           advisory committee.

   A performance standard eliminating nicotine could not be issued in the absence of
    scientific evidence that such elimination would significantly reduce the risks of illness or
    injury from tobacco products.

    >-     Development of such evidence would require reliable information showing that
           elimination of nicotine would reduce the risks of tobacco use, and that the benefits
           of this reduction in use were not outweighed by the risks of a black market or of
           precipitous withdrawal by addicted tobacco users.
            TO RESTRICT TOBACCO PRODUCT ADVERTISING

    S; 1415 expressly provides that FDA may by regulation require that a tobacco
     product be restricted to sale, distribution, or use upon such conditions, including
     restrictions on the access to and the advertising and promotion of the tobacco
     product, if FDA determines that such regulation would be appropriate for the
     protection of the public health.

     ~      This provision has no effect on FDA's regulation of drugs and devices.

   . Advertising restrictions are a critical component of FDA regulation of tobacco
      products.

     ~      Two recent, comprehensive analyses by the National Academy of Science's
            Institute 6fMedicine and the Surgeon General found that tobacco
            advertising plays a significant role in the decisions of young people to use
            cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.

            ~      The two studies are the Institute of Medicine's Report, Growing Up
                   Tobacco Free, Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youth
                   (1994), see especially chapter 4; and the Department of Health and
                   Human Services' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
                   Report, Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People, A Report of
                   the Surgeon General (1994), see especially chapter 5.

                   The Institute of Medicine's 1998 Report, Taking Action to Reduce
                   Tobacco Use (1998) reaffirms the 1994 10M Report.

           In addition, the nation's largest psychological association, the American
           Psychological Association, concluded that tobacco advertising "plays
           directly to the factors" that are most appealing to youth.

           During its rulemaking, FDA found, based on the evidence and comments
           received, that comprehensive advertising restrictions are necessary to ensure
           that the access restrictions on access are not undermined by the product
           appeal that advertising for these products creates for young people.

            ~     Otherwise, tobacco companies will continue to use advertising to
                  appeal to kids, associating tobacco with fun, sex, glamour, and
                  sports. As long as the tobacco companies are allowed to advertise to
                  kids and create a demand for tobacco products, it will be impossible
                  to effectively address 'the problem of youth tobacco use.
           necessary to meet public health goals because they are complementary -

           >-     The effectiveness of access restrictions on youth access would be
                  substantially diminished if the manufacturers were free to entice
                  children and adolescents to circumvent the access restrictions.

   Because advertising restrictions are so critical, the agency's authority in this area
    should not be left ambiguous and open to lengthy court challenges.
              PROPOSED REGULATORY ACTION WILL RESULT
                IN HEIGHTENED DEMAND FOR CONTRABAND

       S. 1415 requires that FDA find that regulations to be imposed on a tobacco product
        "are appropriate for the protection of the public health."

        ~      In making this finding, FDA is directed to consider the risks and benefits to
               the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco
               product, and

               Taking into account the increased or decreased likelihood that: (1) existing
               users of tobacco products will stop using such products, and (2) those who
               do not use tobacco products will initiate use.

               FDA is to weigh a variety of consequences resulting from possible new
               regulations on tobacco products, including the use of contraband products
               and the development of black markets, and consider the effects of the
               regulation on both users and nonusers of the products.

               This standard is not be applied to any other product regulated under the
               Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

       Requiring FDA to affinnatively find that a particular regulatory action will not
        result in the heightened demand for contraband would severely restrict the
        Agency's authority as it would be forced to prove an unknown.

        ~      It could be very difficult to prove a negative-that a black market will not
               occur.

        ~      If FDA makes the finding, its decision would be delayed by extended
               litigation.

      . FDA's 1996 tobacco rule reflects the agency's consideration of the contraband
         Issue:

        ~      Considering the large number of Americans who are currently addicted to
               nicotine, FDA determined that a ban on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco
               would unlikely be effective in protecting consumers from the serious risks
               of these products. FDA found that black markets and smuggling could
               develop, offering products that likely "would be even more dangerous than
               those currently marketed."
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, addiction to these products must be
eliminated or substantially reduced.

FDA found that this goal could be achieved best by preventing minors from
beginning use of tobacco products, and not by banning the products.

AND HARDER TO CHANGE THE WAY TOBACCO COMPANIES DO BUSINESS



       The McCain Bill Gives No Immunity to Tobacco Companies

         The bill passed by the Senate Commerce Committee did away with most of the
 major liability limitations of the June 20th settlement between the tobacco companies
 and the attorneys general, which had banned class action lawsuits and punitive
 damages. The manager's amendment went even further, by eliminating special
 protections for tobacco parent companies and affiliates, ensuring that the industry's
 attorneys will be subject to suit as under current law, and allowing plaintiffs claiming
 injury from disease to use evidence of addiction in their lawsuits. Under the McCain
 bill, anybody can sue the tobacco companies, and get whatever damages a jury will
 award.

      The Cap Is Available Only to Companies that Agree to Make Sweeping
       Advertising Restrictions and Comply with the Law, not Challenge It in Court

       No company will be eligible for the annual damages cap unl~ss it agrees to
 sweeping changes in the way it does business. To be eligible, a company must sign a
 binding protocol that requires it to:

              Accept sweeping restrictions on advertising that would otherwise be
               unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Tobacco advertising is one
               of the most important factors in luring young people to start smoking. A
               recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association
               estimated that 34% of young people start smoking because of tobacco
               advertising and marketing. The First Amendment limits what
               government can do to stop the tobacco companies' harmful advertising
               practices without the companies' consent. To qualify for the cap in the
               McCain bill, a tobacco company must agree to give up advertising that
               contains any human or animal image or cartoon character, all outdoor
               advertising, advertising on the Internet, and much more. The protocol in
               the McCain bill is the only way to get rid of the Marlboro Man, and
               ensure that Joe Camel never comes after our kids again.

             Comply with the terms of the legislation, not tie in up in court. Tobacco
              legislation will be far more successful in its central goal -- reducing youth
              smoking -- if the companies cooperate instead of tying the bill up in court
              for decades. Under the protocol in the McCain bill, a company must
              agree to abide by the rules of the legislation, not file endless legal
              challenges to thwart its intent. Participating companies must agree to
              make payments and lookback surcharges even if those provisions are
              struck down in court.
       Because Any Company That Doesn't Play by the Rules Will Lose Eligibility.

         Without any incentive to sign onto the protocol, companies are bound to go to court to
strike down every part of the tobacco bill they can. But under the McCain bill, once a
company has signed the protocol, the government will have a powerful tool to make that
company change its ways or lose liability relief altogether. A participating company will lose
eligibility for the cap if it violates the protocol. For example:

             A Company Must Make Dramatic Reductions in Youth Smoking or Lose
              Eligibility for the Liability Cap. The manager's amendment strengthened
              the provisions in the bill that link liability protection to the achievement of
              youth smoking targets. Under the amended legislation, a company that misses.
              its youth smoking targets by 20 percent or more has the burden of showing
              both that it did not engage in affirmative misconduct and that it used best
              efforts to reduce youth smoking in order to escape the loss of liability
              protections. The cap is in effect a powerful company-specific penalty to
              ensure that youth smoking goes down.

             Any Company Caught Smuggling Will Lose Eligibility for the Cap. Most
              anti-smuggling experts agree that it would be extremely difficult for
              smuggling to occur on a massive scale without the company's knowledge.
              Under the McCain bill, if a company's management is found guilty of taking
              part in a smuggling scheme, the company will lose any liability relief. This
              will serve as a powerful and necessary incentive to keep tobacco companies
              from orchestrating a black market.

      The Cap in S. 1415 Is Even Tougher on Tobacco Companies than the Cap in the
       Highly-Regarded Chafee-Harkin-Graham Bill

       Senators Chafee, Harkin, and Graham sponsored a tough, comprehensive
tobacco bill that also includes an $8 billion liability .cap as a way to get tobacco
companies to stop marketing to children. Under that bill, tobacco companies were able
to pay $4 billion a year in judgments out of their annual payments to the government.
Under the McCain bill, the tobacco companies would have to pay every penny of
damage awards -- up to $8 billion a year, indexed for inflation -- on top of their annual
payments.

*   Title XIV Does Not Limit The Tobacco Companies' Liability

    Participating manufacturers who comply with the rigorous restrictions in the protocol and
    the other requirements of Title XIV have their liability limited to $8 billion per year. If
    they owe more than $8 billion in a given year, they will simply have to pay the additional
    amount in the next year.

*   The Bill Does Not Prevent or Limit Anyone From Recovering

    Every dollar that a person wins in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry will be"paid.
    The bill does not limit the amounts that people can win. It only postpones payment until
    the next year if the tobacco companies owe more than $8 billion in a given year.

*   The Bill Does Not Limit A Person Who Claims. that They Are Addicted From
    Recovering

    The bill provides for extensive smoking cessation and other public health programs. The
    bill eliminates lawsuits against participating manufacturer only if those suits seek to
    create public health programs, such as smoking cessation programs. It does not limit any
    person from recovering any damages that they themselves have suffered.

*   The Bill Does Not Limit the Evidence that May Be Discovered or Introduced
    Against Tobacco Companies

    The Manager's Amendment removed provisions that would prevent plairitiffs from
    discovering or introducing in court evidence of reduced-risk tobacco products

*   The Bill Does Not Limit Tobacco Companies' Obligation to Produce Documents in
    Litigation

    The Manager's Amendment removed a provision that might have allowed the tobacco
    industry to avoid its obligation to produce documents in lawsuits. Under the Manager's
    Amendment, a person wishing to sue a tobacco company may review documents publicly
    disclosed under Title IX of the bill and may seek documents in discovery

*   The Bill Does Not Protect Attorneys, Advertising Agents, or Parent Companies

    The Manager's Amendment expressly allows lawsuits against tobacco manufacturers and
    their parent companies. It does not change current law with respect to suits against
    attorneys and advertising agents, and thus does not preclude such suits.

*   The Bill Allows Class Actions and Third-party Claims to Go Forward

*   The Bill Does Not Limit Recovery for Punitive Damages
                             and Greatest Benefits from McCain Bill

    Lower Income Adults Are Most Responsive to Price

          Two recent studies have evaluated the effect of cigarette prices on smoking
           participation (the decision to smoke at all), and have documented an important fact:
           the smoking participation decision of lower income adults is much more responsive to
           price than that of higher income adults. In particular, both studies find that those
           individuals at the median income or below are more than four times as 'likely to not
           smoke in response to price increases as are those individuals above median income. 3

          The professional consensus is that for every 'I 0% rise in cigarette prices, there is a
           roughly 4.5% decline in the total number of packs of cigarettes consumed. These
           studies find that individuals at the median income or below are more than 50% more
           responsive to price in their smoking decisions than the overall average. This implies
           that every 10% rise in cigarette prices will cause the number of packs consumed to
           fall by about 7%.4

          Using this elasticity, estimates show that there is a 33% reduction in smoking for
           those at the median income or below from the $1.10 price increase, as compared to
           the 23% reduction on average, and only about an 8% reduction above median income.

   So Lower Income Families Will See Only a Modest Increase in Spending on Cigarettes

          The implications of this finding are thatthe price increases in the McCain legislation
           will not cause a significant increase in cigarette spending for lower income
           individuals. This is because, on average across individuals at or below the median
           income, for every two packs on which this group spends an extra $1.10, there will be
           one pack on which they save the $2 base price.

          These effects roughly cancel, resulting on net in only a small increase in spending on
           cigarettes in this population. In particular, total spending on cigarettes, on average,
           for a median income family will rise by only about 3%. This is only about $20 per
           year for a median income smoker.



      3R ingel, J. and W. Evans, "Public Finance Aspects of the Global Tobacco Settlement",
Working Paper, University of Maryland, 1998; Farelly, M., J. Bray, T. Pechacek, and T.
Woolery, "The Response to Increases in Cigarette Prices by Race, Income, and Age Groups,"
Working Paper, Research Triangle Institute, 1998.

        4These studies focus only on the smoking participation decision. But a conservative
assumption is that the number of packs per smoker will follow the same income relationship.
This is conservative because it is likely that the first source of response by lower income smokers
will be to reduce packs rather than to quit altogether.

     An important use of the funds raised by the McCain bill is to fund increased cessation
      sp.ending so that those smokers who want to quit this addictive habit can do so.

     Unfortunately, cessation treatment can be expensive - more expensive in the short run
      than the cost of cigarettes. As a result, it is low income individuals who are least
      likely to avail themselves of cessation treatment.

     Thus, increased cessation spending should benefit lower income groups the most,
      since these are the individuals who cannot afford cessation treatments now.

     Cessation programs have been shown to be effective in reducing smoking. This
      reduction will produce further savings for lower income groups in particular, since
      they will not be spending their hard-earned income on cigarettes.

Low Income People Will Gain More in Health Terms:

     As noted above, recent evidence indicates that lower income individuals are more
      responsive to price increases than are those above median income. As a result, they
      will benefit disproportionately from the health benefits that come from reduced
      smoking.

     In particular, the number of packs smoked in families with incomes below the median
      income will fall by 33 %, while the number of packs smoked by families with
      incomes above the median will fall by only 8%. This means that the health benefits
      will be 4 times as large for lower income families as for higher income families.

     Moreover, lower-income individuals spend a higher percentage oftheir income on
      health costs. They therefore stand to gain the most from reducing smoking-related
      health costs.

    AND AVOIDS HANDING A WINDFALL PROFIT TO TOBACCO INDUSTRY



      Lugar Bill Would Require Drastic Cuts in Health Spending

        The Lugar bill requires the government to "buy-out" farmers from the quota program
over a three-year period (FY1999 through 2002). The cost of this buy-out over the three
years is $18 billion dollars. If the Lugar farmer spending is added and ,state spending is
kept the same, the McCain Manager's Amendment spending on health research and
public health programs would have to be cut by 69 percent to make up the difference.
(See chart below). In contrast, the Ford-Hollings approach costs $2.1 billion a year during
those years and has no effect on the levels of spending in the McCain Amendment for NIH
research, cessation, prevention, education and enforcement efforts.

      Ford Limits Amount of Tobacco Grown; Lugar Dramatically Increases U.S.
       Production

        Senator Ford's bill (LEAF Act) maintains limits on the amount of tobacco that can be
grown in the United States. Under the competing Lugar approach, very large producers
would quickly expand their production. A U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis
concludes production of flue-cured tobacco is likely to increase by as much as 50% and
burley tobacco is projected to increase by as much as 20%. That is one reason why the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Cancer Society, and the American Heart
Association support continuation of the tobacco program.

      Ford-Hollings Protects Small and Minority Farms

        The increased production with lower profit margins under the Lugar approach will
benefit large corporate farmers, however, the legislation would have a disproportionately
adverse impact on minority and limited-resource tobacco producers. Market uncertainties
and reduced margins on small sales will destabilize many family faiming operations. This
will have a particularly harsh effect on small African-American farms -- fully 90% of
African-American farms have sales ofless than $25,000.

      Lugar Leads to a Financial Windfall for Companies

        The creation of a free market in tobacco production will dramatically lower the prices
the companies will pay to buy tobacco. USDA estimates that under the Lugar bill, the price
of flue-cured tobacco would fall from $1.72 a pound to $1.15, and the price of burley would
plummet from $1.89 to $1.35. Given that the companies average almost 1.5 billion pounds of
purchases a year, USDA estimates a financial windfall by the companies of at least $800
million annually or $20 billion over 25 years. The Ford approach is consistent with the
overall tobacco control legislation. It avoids generating windfall profits for the tobacco
companies with which the companies will offset the payments designed to force them to
reduce youth smoking rates.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  BRUCE REED


SUBJECT:               Riggs Bilingual Education Bill


        On Thursday May 21 the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families
reported H.R. 3892, the English Fluency Act, introduced by Rep. Frank Riggs. This bill raises
many of the same programmatic issues and political dynamics as the Unz Initiative in California,
as well as additional civil rights enforcement concerns. We expect the bill to be taken up at the
full committee either on June 4 or June 11.

        The purpose of this memo is to update you on our strategy for addressing this bill.
Because few members have focused on this bill yet, the political context in which it will be
considered is still quite fluid. The Unz vote in California next week as well as the mark-up
shortly after the recess will focus attention on this issue, and we will reassess the situation and
our strategy after these and other significant events.

I.     Summary and Analysis of the Proposed Legislation

        The bill would eliminate the existing Bilingual Education and Emergency Immigrant
Education programs and (1) establish a formula block grant program to states to provide
assistance to LEP and immigrant students in English language instruction, (2) require states to
withdraw funding from local programs in cases where students do not master English within two
years; (3) set a 3-year limit for serving any individual student with these program funds; (4)
require parental consent before a student could be placed in a program that uses native language
instruction; and, (5) prohibit states from exempting LEP students who have been in the same
school system for 2 years from statewide testing in academic subjects in English, by withdrawing
funds under this program from states that do not follow this policy.

        In addition, the bill would void existing compliance agreements between the Department's
Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and States and local school districts, if those agreements require
those States and schooi districts to develop, implement, provide, or maintain any form of
bilingual education. Similarly, the bill requires OCR to publish in the Federal Register all
enforcement guidelines and compliance standards that relate to the provision of English language


                                                  1


                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
into any new compliance agreements based on those guidelines or standards until those
guidelines and standards, themselves, are approved by a subsequent statute.

        This bill is seriously flawed in a number of respects, even though it attempts to promote
the more rapid mastery of English. Like Unz, its punative approach is likely to result in fewer
rather than more students mastering English. It is simply unrealistic to expect that all students, or
even a large proportion of them, will master English within 2 years. And in cases where this
timetable is not achieved, the sole remedy is to cut off funds. The bill makes no provisions to
provide extra help to individual students who lack English proficiency after two years. Nor does
it provide a mechanism or resources to strengthen local programs that do not meet the two year
standard.

        The proposed state block grant would replace the existing discretionary grant program
that targets funds to the local school systems with the greatest need and highest quality proposals.
 There would be no formula for allocating funds to local school districts within each state./Un"d"er
this arrangement, funding would be less effectively targeted to communities with the grta'test
need, especially large cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Chicago. These
communities generally receive less than their fair share of funds in other programs (e.g., Goals
2000 and the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund) that allow states to distribute funds on a
discretionary rather than formula basis. In addition, the bill lacks maintenance of effort and
supplement-not-supplant provisions to prevent States and school districts from substituting
federal funds for state and local funds.

         The Riggs bill is likely to exacerbate the current shortage of qualified bilingual education
and ESL teachers nationwide. It would eliminate the professional development program which
helps strengthen the skills of existing teachers and train new ESL and bilingual education
teachers. In contrast to your FY 1999 proposal to double funding for teacher training, this bill
would limit state use of funds for teacher training and force teacher training to compete for funds
for service delivery at the local level.

        Finally, the civil rights provisions could effectively end--or at least seriously delay--
enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as it applies to the education of
language minority children, through the use of voluntary compliance agreements. The use of
compliance agreements is one of OCR's most important (and, by far, the most commonly used)
enforcement tools regarding the provision of appropriate educational programs for such children.
  Title VI, itself, requires OCR to attempt to resolve all compliance problems under it, including
those relating to the education of language minority children, through voluntary meaRS before
employing other, 'more adversarial, means, such as funding terminations--preceded by
administrative litigation--and referral to the Department of Justice for court litigation. If H.R.
3892 were enacted, OCR enforcement of Title VI as it applies to the education of language
minority children would necessarily have to rely far more on litigation than it currently does, and
States and school districts would necessarily endure far more costly and time-consuming

                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
private parties, as well, because States and school districts would no longer be ably to rely on
voluntary agreements with OCR as evidence of their compliance with Title VI.

II.     Congressional Outlook and Strategy

       The bill was reported out of subcommittee on a party-line vote. We expect the bill to be
taken up at full committee shortly after recess, on either June 4 or June 11. We expect
Democrats will remain unifonnly opposed to the bill at committee.

         The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is adamantly opposed to the Riggs bill. Shortly
before subcommittee mark-up they met with Secretary Riley and pressed him very hard for a veto
threat from the Administration. While Secretary Riley would in fact recommend a veto of this
bill, he told the Caucus that a veto threat would need to be accompanied by an alternative bill, in
order to reinforce the Administration's principles for strengthening bilingual education
articulated in his statement opposing the Unz Initiative, and to provide cover to Democrats
voting against Riggs. However, Caucus members are also finnly opposed to the introduction of
any altemative bill, and we will have difficult gaining strong Democratic support for our
alternative over the opposition of the CHe. They prefer to delay consideration of changes in the
program until next year's scheduled reauthorization. In addition, they are not comfortable with
the prospect of translating our 3-year goal for students to become proficient in English into
legislation. For subcommittee mark-up, the CHC preferred that we stay silent on the bill rather
than signalling opposition short of a veto threat, or coupling a veto threat with an altemative bill.
 We did not comment on the bill before subcommittee mark up, but will need to take a position
before full committee.

       We have been working with Mr. Gephardt's office to gauge the bill's prospects on the
House floor. However, few members beyond the subcommittee and the Hispanic Caucus have
focused on it, so it is difficult to predict how this will play out. While the civil rights provisions
may help keep Democrats together, we expect that many conservative Democrats, particularly
those without sizeable Hispanic constituencies, will find it difficult to oppose this legislation,
especially in the wake of the anticipated Unz vote, without some alternative to vote for.

        There is no indication at present that the Senate Education and Labor Committee intends
to take up the Riggs bill. While there is always a chance of a floor amendment, we think the
odds that such a move would succeed are quite slim. Thus, it is very unlikely that a bill to
overhaul bilingual education will pass the Congress this session.

        Our primary objective therefore is to oppose Riggs while avoiding the appearance of
defending the status quo. We also have an opportunity to set the stage for the reauthorization of
the bilingual education progam in the next Congress, if we can effectively advocate for our own
refonn approach without splitting Democrats on the issue. Our effectiveness toward these ends
depends in part our ability to gain Hispanic Caucus support for our alternative. This in tum will


                                                  3


                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
the extent to which the Caucus continues to want a strong veto threat on this bill, and our
willingness to condition a veto threat on CHC support for our alternative legislation.
        To accomplish our objectives, we will stay in close touch with the CHC and with Mr.
Gephardt's office, and are planning the following steps:

      Prepare an alternative legislative proposal. The Education Department is drafting
       legislation, in the form of amendments to the existing bilingual education program, based
       on the principles articulated by Secretary Riley's statement of opposition to Unz. While
       the legislation can be ready shortly, we have not yet determined the best time to introduce
       the bill. As indicated above; if an alternative were introduced at committee mark-up next
       week, we could not count on broad Democratic support due to CHC opposition. We
       believe the situation could well change when the bill comes to the floor, when many
       Demcrats may feel the need for an alterntive to vote for in order to vote against Riggs. If
       this situation materializes, we believe the Hispanic Caucus will likely change its position
       and support our alternative. If not, we would again face the prospect of offering a bill
       that is opposed by a significant number of Democrats, and would recommend against
       taking this step.

      Continue to link the possibility of a veto threat to support for our alternative
       proposal, at least through full committee mark-up. In our conversations with the
       Hispanic Caucus leading up to the full committee mark-up, we will continue to take the
       position that we cannot issue a veto threat unless we also put our alternative on the table,
       with their support. In the short run, the most likely result of this approach is that we
       indicate our "strong opposition" to the Riggs bill before mark-up, rather than issueing a
       veto threat, though the outcome of the Unz vote could affect how caucus members view
       the value of an alternative bill, even before the mark-up. When the bill goes to the floor
       we will be able to better guage the desirability of a veto threat and alternative legislation,
       and will reassess our strategy accordingly.


                                                                                        .
       Consider nonlegislative steps to highlight your committment to reforming bilingual
       education. In order to ensure that your opposition to Riggs is not equated with a defense
       of the status quo, we are exploring several steps you could take to underscore your
       committment to reform. One would be to issue a directive to the Education Department
       or NPR, to identify models of effective approaches to helping kids become proficient in
       English within your 3-year goal. A second approach would be to begin to reframe the
       debate over bilingual education. In addition to stressing the necessity ofLEP kids
       becoming proficient in English within 3 years, you could also call for efforts to help more
       native English speakers become proficient in a second language, in order to be
       competitive in the global economy. In California, each of the gubernatorial candiates has
       taken this approach, stressing the value of all students leaving school fluent in English
       and another language.

      Veto Threat for Full Committee. Secretary Riley will send a letter just before mark-up,
       indicating that he will recommend a veto if this bill comes to you. This would be a strong
       signal that would help hold the Democrats together in committee and on the floor. The
       rationale for the veto would stress our problems with the civil rights enforcement
       provisions, but would also raise our objections to the programmatic features of the bill.
       The veto threat would be coupled with a reiteration of the priniciples for how to
       strengthen bilingual ed you approved in the context of the decision to oppose Unz, and an
       indication that Administration will develop legislation fully in accord with these
       principles, without specifying when such legislation would be transmitted. The letter
       could also highlight your budget comittment to bilingual education, including particularly
       teacher training.
