                                  February 1997



Q:   YOUR MEDICARE PLAN SCORES $82 BILLION INSTEAD OF $100 BILLION
     OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. WILL YOU SUBMIT ADDITIONAL
     PROPOSALS TO ACHIEVE $100 BILLION SCORING OFF OF THE CBO
     BASELINE?

A:       We believe that the track record of our actuaries on estimates over the last five
          years validates our position that our Medicare plan will achieve $100 billion in
          savings. Our estimates for the balanced budget are based on conservative, time-
          proven projections that have been more accurate then CBO for 4 straight years.


Q:   HAVING SAID THAT, WILL YOU SUBMIT ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS TO
     ACHIEVE $100 BILLION SO YOU CAN BACKUP YOU R CLAIM THAT YOU
     WILL MEET THE REPUBLICANS HALFWAY?

A:       Again, we believe our numbers do that now. Our technical analysts will continue
          to work with CBO to see if further clarifications of our current policy will close
          the gap on scorable savings. It is premature to speculate about what, if any,
          revisions will be necessary until that process is complete.


Q:   YOU HA VE INCLUDED A HOME HEALTH CARE TRANSFER GIMMICK IN THE
     BUDGET. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY DEFEND IT?

A:       Let's be clear: our savings of $138 billion in Medicare over 6 years ($100 billion
          over 5 years) does not include the home health care transfer from Part A to Part B
          of the program. The $138 billion is the net reduction of Medicare spending
          relative to the budget baseline -- and thus is the amount by which our Medicare
          changes contribute to deficit reduction. The transfer does not contribute to the
          $252 net deficit reduction in our package.

         The policy you mentioned was in our budget last year, and it was in the House
          Republican budget in 1995 that every Republican in the House voted for.

         Shifting long-term home health visits (other than the first 100 visits following a
          hospitalization) away from Part A of the Medicare program makes sense because
          home health care has increasingly become a chronic care benefit not linked to
          hospitalization. It was also the established policy prior to the 1980s. And it
          protects the Medicare Trust Fund until 2007, while not imposing harmful cuts on
          hospitals or other priorities, or excessive burdens on beneficiaries.
                                                      Automated Records ManagementSystem
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
     been hospitalized, home health care has increasingly become a chronic care benefi~ not
     linked to hospitalization. Our proposal restores the original split ofhome health care
     benefits so that the first 100 home health visits following a 3-day hospitalization would be
     reimbursed by Part A and all other visits -- including those not following hospitalizadon -
     - would be reimbursed by Part B.]


Q:   FOLLOW: IF THE HOME HEALTH TRANSFER IS NOT A GIMMICK, THEN WHY
     DON'T YOU INCLUDE IT AS PART OF THE PART B PREMIUM?

A:          We have always been concerned about out-of-pocket costs for Medicare
             beneficiaries. Older Americans spend, on average, 20 percent of their income on
             health care and three-fourths have incomes lower than $25,000. We have to be
           . careful that as we reform the Medicare program, we do not place undue burden
             on lower-income seniors.


Q.   WHY ARE YOU MANAGED CARE CUTS SO DEEP? AREN'T THESE CUTS GOING
     TO DISCOURAGE BENEFICIARIES FROM GOING INTO MANAGED CARE AND
     FORCE PLANS TO CUT BACK ON BENEFITS?

A.         There is no reason to believe that these modest cuts will cause managed care plans
            to have to cut back in benefits, nor will they hurt plans with large numbers of
            managed care enrollees. The Medicare Trust Fund is actually losing money on the
            increasing numbers of beneficiaries enrolling in managed care.

           Every credible study has confirmed that we are significantly overpaying Medicare
            managed care (Congressional Budget Office analysis, the General Accounting
            Office, the Prospective Payment Review Commission study, and the Mathematica
            Research Study done for the Health Care Financing Administration). In fact,
            these experts claim that we overcompensate managed care far beyond what our
            proposal suggests.

           Finally, our proposal does not even implement this reform until 2000, giving
            managed care plans more than enough time to prepare for this change.


Q.   YOUR MEDICARE PROPOSAL CONTAINS MOSTLY CUTS ON PROVIDERS AND
     MANAGED CARE. DON'T YOU THINK WE NEED REAL STRUCTURAL
     MEDICARE REFORM?

A.         Absolutely. My budget takes important steps to modernize Medicare and bring it
                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


         Establishing new private plans -- including Preferred Provider Organizations and
          Provider Sponsored Organizations -- available to seniors and people with
          disabilities.

         Establishing market-oriented purchasing for Medicare including the new prospective
          payment systems for home health care, nursing home care, and outpatient hospital
          services, as well as competitive bidding authority and the use of centers of
          excellence to improve quality and cut back on costs.

         Adding new Medigap protections to make it possible for beneficiaries to switch
                                                                              back from a

Q.   DO YOU SUPPORT THE MEDICARE COMMISSION PROPOSED BY SENATORS
     ROTH AND MOYNIHAN?

A.       First, I want to praise Chairman Roth and Ranking Member Moynihan for
          working together -- on a bipartisan basis -- to propose the creation of a
                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
          efforts reflect a bipartisan spirit which we believe is critical to ensure the success of
          any process designed to address this important issue.

        No one is more committed than I am to seeking a bipartisan process to find long
         term solutions to Medicare. But my more immediate focus is reaching a
         bipartisan agreement on a balanced budget that extends the life of the Medicare
         Trust Fund in the near term. We have an historic opportunity to balance the
         budget. We should not let it pass.

        As I have repeatedly said, we will need a bipartisan process to address the long-
         term financing issues facing Medicare, and I look forward to working with both
         parties to develop the best possible process.


Q.   DOESN'T YOUR BUDGET CREATE $60 BILLION IN NEW ENTITLEMENTS?

A.      No. My budget actually saves $121 billion in entitlement spending over the next
         5 years.

        We are proposing some new additions to our health care programs, but they are
         aimed at reducing the number of uninsured Americans and are not open-ended
         entitlements. For example:



         -- Our program to provide health insurance for workers between jobs is capped.
         The program is structured as a grants program to States. While there are
         provisions to help States that have unanticipated increases in unemployment, there
         is an overall Federal cap on spending that cannot be brcached. Moreover, the
         program is sunsetted after 4 years.

         -- There are no new entitlements in children's health as well. The children's
         health initiative provides States with grants that, by law, will not exceed $750
         million in each year.

        Weare also proposing some changes to the welfare reform legislation that was
         enacted last year, but our purpose is to fix unnecessary and damaging provisions
         in that legislation -- involving legal immigrants and Food Stamp recipients. We
         do not view these changes as new spending or new entitlements.

        It is ironic that we are sometimes criticized for phasing out new proposals -- such
         as school construction -- and simultaneously for creating permanent new
         mandatory spending programs. Our phase-outs are designed to allow an
         evaluation of how well the new programs are working -- and we have been careful
         to avoid creating permanent new entitlements without knowing the effects.
                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
,




    Q.   WHY ARE YOU CUTTING THE MEDICAID AND MEDICARE PROGRAMS IN
         ORDER TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH?

    A.       We believe that we can constrain Medicare and Medicaid growth while still
              preserving the guarantee of high quality care for the millions of Americans who
              depend on these programs. Cost-effective approaches to expanding coverage, in
              the context of a balanced budget, should be a high-priority investment for this
              nation.


    Q.   WHY IS THE ADMINISTRATION ACTING SO HAPHAZARDLY ON QUALITY
         ISSUES. FIRST IT WAS DRIVE-THROUGH-DELIVERIES, THEN MASTECTOMIES,
         NOW GAG RULES. DO YOU HA VE A STRATEGY IN THIS AREA?

    A.       Yes, we do have a strategy. We believe that we have taken some important steps
              in areas where there have been troubling reports about the lack of high-quality
              medicine. When there are egregious examples of bureaucratic interference with
              the practice of high-quality medicine, we will not hesitate to act. However, I have
              announced plans to create an Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and
              Quality in the Health Care Industry. That panel, which will be named shortly,
              will help us to develop a broader framework on how we should address concerns
              about quality in a more comprehensive manner.

    Q.   WHAT IS THE STATUS OF YOUR QUALITY COMMISSION?

    A.       I expect to make an announcement about the members and charge of this
              commission sometime in March.

    Q.   DO YOU SUPPORT THE KENNEDY-DINGELL BILL ON CONSUMER RIGHTS?

    A.       We just received the bill and have not yet had time to review the details.
              However, we believe that Congressman Dingell and Senator Kennedy are making
              an important contribution to the discussion about quality. We look forward to
              working with them as well as other Democrats and Republicans on this important
              Issue.

                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
