MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                    Bruce Reed
                         Mike Cohen

SUBJECT:                 ESEA Reauthorization Proposal

       We have been working with the First Lady's office, OMB, the Vice President's office and
the Education Department to develop the strongest possible proposal to reauthorize the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, with the objective of transmitting it to Congress by
March 1. While there is still much to be done to shape and finalize this proposal, we have made
progress in addressing some of the most significant issues. (Although Secretary Riley has not
reviewed our suggestions in detail, Deputy Secretary Smith has been very closely involved in the
process.) This memo looks at how the 1994 refonns are working, where they are falling short,
and what improvements we are considering. We are planning to meet with you in early January.

I. Progress Report on the 1994 Reauthorization and Goals 2000

       Our reauthorization proposal will build on the framework for federal aid to elementary
and secondary education established in Goals 2000 and the Improving America's Schools Act,
the 1994 reauthorization of ESEA. In principle, both of these Acts overhauled federal
elementary and secondary education programs by:

      Insisting that every state set challenging academic students that all students are expected
       to reach. Goals 2000 required states to set academic standards for all students and
       develop assessments aligned to those standards. Title I of ESE A built on this requirement
       by mandating that states use these standards for disadvantaged students, thus ending the
       practice of setting lower expectations for low-income students.

      Providing schools, school districts, and states with the flexibility to determine how best to
       educate students to meet high standards. Goals 2000 provided states and districts with
       tremendous flexibility in how funds could be used, and for the first time allowed the
       Secretary of Education to waive federal requirements if they impeded state or local
       refonn efforts. ESEA reduced regulations, paperwork, and reporting requirements;
       launched your initiative to establish 3,000 charter schools; and pennitted high-poverty
       schools (with 50% or more students eligible for Title I) to combine funds from separate
       streams and use them to improve the whole school.

      Holding schools accountable for the results they achieve, rather than for compliance with


                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion



             rules and regulations. Title 1 now requires states to set annual goals for each school and
             district relating to the number of students who must reach academic standards; to report
             progress annually for each school (disaggregating data by demographic subgroups); and
             to intervene in schools that fail to make adequate progress.

             These reforms have sparked considerable state and local education reform activity. There
      is, however, still much more to be done to achieve significant improvement in elementary and
      secondary education, especially in high-poverty schools. The key lessons from the
      implementation of Goals 2000, ESEA, and related state and local reforms include:

            Standards-based education reform works. A recent Rand study of education reform in
             North Carolina and Texas -- the two states with the best track record of improving
             achievement generally and closing achievement gaps between minority and white
             students -- shows that a sustained, statewide approach of raising academic standards,
             providing schools with the flexibility and tools they need, targeting resources for extra
             help to low-performing students and schools, and holding schools accountable for results
             produces results, particularly for disadvantaged students. Other studies also have shown
             that states and school districts -- including urban school districts like Philadelphia,
             Boston, San Francisco, and Chicago -- that have adopted similar approaches have shown
             significant gains in reading and math. This data indicate that our overall strategy is
             sound. Ifwe maintain the recent direction of federal education policy while intensifying
             our efforts, we can improve elementary and secondary education across the nation.

           States have adopted policies effecting standards-based education reform, but these
            policies do not go far enough. Forty-eight states have set new, more challenging
            academic standards, and most states are working to develop or adopt new assessments
            aligned with these standards. Fewer states, however, have adopted accountability systems
            along with the standards. Only 25 states provide for intervention in low-performing
            schools, as required by Title 1. In addition, only 17 states provide extra help, such as
            summer school or tutoring, for students who do not meet the standards, and only five
            states require students to demonstrate they have met the standards as a condition for
            promotion.

           Implementation of state policies providing for standards, assessments, and accountability
            leaves room for improvement. Title 1 includes a series of deadlines for implementing
            state policies on standards, assessments, and accountability. Although not all of the
            implementation deadlines have been reached, it is already clear that many states are not
            on track to meet them. In addition, some states are failing to implement these policies as
            envisioned. For example, some states have evaded the full extent of their responsibility
            to set goals for "adequate yearly progress" for students and schools. And although half
            the states have policies that provide for some kind of intervention in low-performing
            schools, many have shown themselves unable or unwilling to take the actions necessary
            to tum around these schools so they provide an acceptable education.


                                                     2



                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion




              Improvements in the quality of teachers and teaching are urgently needed. Governor
               Hunt's National Commission on Teaching and America's Future has underscored the
               difficulty of recruiting and retaining talented and well-prepared teachers, especially in
               schools with the most disadvantaged students. About 50,000 teachers each year enter the
               profession with emergency or substandard licenses. Nearly one quarter of secondary
               school teachers lack even a minor in their main teaching field, and in schools with the
               highest minority enrollment, students have less than a 50% chance of having a math or
               science teacher with a license and degree in the field. On average, 22% of new teachers
               leave the field within three years, and in urban areas 30-50% leave within five years.
               Paraprofessionals are widely and increasingly used to provide instruction to low-
               achieving students in Title 1 schools, with as many as 20% of Title 1 instructional aides
               providing instruction without a teacher's supervision. By one estimate, instructional aides
               account for roughly half (67,000) of the entire Title 1 instructional workforce, and Title 1
               aides are being hired at twice the rate of Title 1 certified teachers.

               The Eisenhower professional development program, the main federal program to improve
               teacher quality (Goals 2000 and Title 1 also provide some funds for this purpose), has
               failed to improve the situation in any significant way. Recent evaluation data suggest that
               in many districts, the Eisenhower program funds activities of limited effectiveness. And
               even where the activities are effective, the program often fails to fund them at an adequate
               level. The Higher Education Act you signed last year includes a new program to provide
               scholarships to highly qualified individuals who commit to teaching in high-poverty
               schools, but the current appropriation is sufficient for only about 1,400 of these
               scholarships.

        II. Major Changes to ESEA

                 Our budget contains a number of initiatives to expand educational opportunity in the
        elementary and secondary grades: school modernization, class size reduction, after-school
        funding connected to social promotions policy, and an increase in Title 1 funding for the specific
        purpose of intervening in low-performing schools. Our ESEA reauthorization can build on these
        initiatives by insisting on what the studies suggest we most need: accountability -- for students,
        teachers, and low-performing schools. With this Congress, we may not be able to enact every
        ESEA reform we want, but we can put forward a bold vision of the future of school reform.

                 We recommend a new set of accountability requirements as a condition for any state or
        district to receive any ESEA funds (not just Title 1). States and school districts would be
        required to produce annual school report cards, end social promotions, intervene in the lowest
        performing schools, and end the use of unqualified teachers. Taken together, these new
        requirements represent a fundamental change in federal aid to elementary and secondary
        education. For the first time, the federal government would link investment in state and local
        education systems with their commitment to take the steps necessary to enable all students,


                                                        3


                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
way for the federal government to help students is to insist that states and local school districts
live up to their responsibilities, rather than simply attempting to compensate for their failure to
do so.

        Along with the investments in your budget, this approach is intended to help close the
opportunity gap by lifting achievement in low-performing schools and making sure that
disadvantaged students are not left behind. We hope the approach would be compelling enough
to unite Congressional Democrats, the education community and the public, as well as to counter
an expected Republican push for vouchers and block grants.

         A. Annual School Report Cards. Our proposal would require annual report cards,
easily understood by and widely distributed to parents and the public, for each school, school
district, and state. The report cards would include information on student achievement, teacher
quality, school safety, and class size. Where appropriate, the data collected and published --
especially on student achievement -- would be broken down by demographic subgroups, to allow
a greater focus on the gaps between minority and majority, low-income and more advantaged
students.

        B. Ending Social Promotions. Our proposal would require states and districts
participating in ESEA to adopt policies that (1) require students to meet academic performance
standards at key transition points in elementary and middle school and for high school
graduation; (2) use objective measures -- i.e., tests valid for these purposes -- to make an initial
determination if a student has met the standards; and (3) permit (or conceivably, require) other,
non-objective factors, including teacher judgment, to enter into a final determination as to
whether the student has met the standards. States and school districts would have to show how
they will help students meet promotion standards by (1) strengthening learning opportunities in
the classroom with steps such as clear grade-by-grade standards, small classes with well prepared
teachers, high quality professional development, and the use of proven instructional practices; (2)
 identifying students who need help at the earliest possible moment; (3) providing extended
learning time, including after-school and summer school, for students who need extra help; and
(4) providing an effective remedial plan for students who do not meet the standards on time, so
that they do not repeat the same unsuccessful experiences. The proposal would phase in this
requirement over five years; design the requirement to fit state governance systems (allowing
"local control" states to delegate responsibilities to the local school district); and base the
requirement on state or local rather than national standards. The Secretary would review and
approve each state's plan, with continued funding conditional on adequate annual progress ii
implementing the plan.

        To reinforce this requirement and encourage local school systems to address it even
before the enactment of ESEA, your FY2000 budget contains a $400 million increase in funding
for the 21 51 Century Learning Center program, half of which will be reserved for after-school and
summer school programs in school districts implementing policies to end social promotions.


                                                 4


                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
districts participating in ESEA to phase out the use of unqualified teachers over five years. In
particular, states and school districts would have to end the use of (1) teachers with emergency
rather than full certification; (2) secondary school teachers teaching "out of field" -- i.e., teaching
subjects for which they lack an academic major or minor; and (3) instructional aides serving as
lead instructors. Ending these practices is particularly important for high-poverty schools, where
the practices are most prevalent. States also would have to adopt teacher competency tests for
new teachers, including tests of subject-matter expertise for secondary school teachers. States
and school districts would be able to use funds from a number of ESE A programs, including
Title 1, bilingual education, and a new grant program focused in part on teacher quality, to help
meet these requirements.

       In addition, we are working with the Education Department to fashion a requirement for
states and school districts to deal with low-performing teachers. We are exploring a number of
approaches, including (1) requiring periodic recertification of teachers, and (2) requiring school
districts to adopt procedures to identify low-performing teachers, provide them with needed help,
and remove them fairly and quickly if they do not improve. We will work closely with the NEA
and AFT over the coming weeks to try and fashion a provision that will meet our objectives
while addressing their concerns.

        D. Accountability Fund for Title 1 Schools. We recommend significantly
strengthening accountability requirements in Title 1 so as to require and adequately fund
immediate and significant state and local intervention in the lowest performing schools.
Because the schools of greatest concern are invariably Title 1 schools and because Title 1 already
contains certain accountability provisions, we believe we should incorporate these provisions
into Title 1, rather than imposing a broader ESEA requirement.                             .

        Our proposal would retain current provisions for states to adopt performance standards
and assessments by 2001. In addition, it would strengthen the current provisions in Title 1
relating to low-performing schools by: (1) requiring the immediate public identification of and
intervention in the lowest performing schools in each state -- i.e., schools with very low levels of
achievement that have made little or no improvement over the previous three years; (2) setting
aside 2.5% of Title 1 funds to support aggressive intervention in these schools, including an
external assessment of each school's needs and the implementation of needed improvements
(such as addressing school safety and security needs, providing better teacher training, acquiring
up-to-date textbooks, technology, and curriculum materials, and extending learning time to help
students catch up academically); and (3) requiring states to provide recognition or rewards to
Title 1 schools showing the greatest improvements.

       To increase the appeal of this approach, your FY2000 budget contains a significant
increase in Title 1 funding, of which $200 million is specifically dedicated to this initiative.

            III.   Other Changes in ESEA

                    A. Charter Schools and Public School Choice. Earlier this fall you signed the Charter
            Schools Expansion Act of 1998, which strengthened incentives for states to (1) increase the
            number of high-quality charter schools, (2) strengthen accountability for charter schools, (3)
            maximize flexibility for charter schools, and (4) provide charter schools with their proper share
            of federal program funds. We believe, along with most in Congress, that no further changes
            relating to charter schools are needed in the ESEA reauthorization process.

                    We do recommend, however, proposing new authority in ESEA to enable the Education
            Department to support other, new approaches to expanding public school choice. At present, the
            Department has authority only to support specific approaches to choice, such as intra-district
            magnet schools in the context of desegregation efforts, and (as of last year) high schools on
            community college campuses. We will propose a new competitive grants program that will give
            the Education Department the ability to support a much wider range of choice approaches,
            including district-wide public school choice systems, interdistrict magnet schools and other
            interdistrict approaches, work-site schools, schools-within-schools, and post-secondary
            enrollment options.

                   As a first step in this direction, your FY2000 budget proposal will contain funds and
            necessary authorizing language for three specific choice initiatives: $10 million in grants to
            school districts to establish work-site schools; $10 million to support interdistrict magnet
            schools; and (as already authorized) $10 million to establish high schools on community college
            campuses.

                    B. Bilingual Education. We recommend changes to the Title VII Bilingual Education
            program and to Title 1 (which serves more than 1.1 million LEP students) consistent with
            statements you and Secretary Riley made in opposing California's Unz Initiative. These
            statements called for (1) expanding the flexibility given to local communities to select the
            programs they believe will best educate LEP students; (2) making sure teachers are well trained'
            to teach LEP students; and (3) strengthening accountability for programs serving LEP students by
            including a goal that all LEP students reach English proficiency within three years.

                     To expand local flexibility and parental choice, we would remove the Title VII provision
            in current law that limits expenditures on English-language (rather than bilingual) programs to
            25% of the funds available. We also would require parental approval for participation in any
            program funded under Title VII. To improve teacher quality, we would phase in a requirement
            that schools receiving Title 1 funds provide LEP students with appropriately trained teachers.
            We also would strengthen the teacher training provisions in Title VII by giving funding priority
            to school districts and institutions of higher education that have implemented proven programs to
            hire, train, and support new ESL and bilingual teachers.

                   In Title 1, we would require that LEP students be included in the assessment and


                                                            6


                                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
instruction and, after three years of schooling in the United States, in English. We would require
schools to disaggregate data, so that they would report -- and be accountable for -- both the
academic achievement and the English language proficiency ofLEP students. We also would
require schools receiving Title I funds to provide alternative instructional strategies for LEP
students who do not make adequate progress in English proficiency after three years. Finally,
we would cut offTitl~ VII funding to a program after three years ifit could not show that
students made significant gains in both English and academic subjects.

        C. Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. As you announced at the White House
Conference on School Safety, we would significantly overhaul the Safe and Drug Free Schools
Program to improve its effectiveness at promoting drug-free, safe, and disciplined learning
environments. Our proposal would accomplish this by (1) requiring states to allocate funds to
local school districts on a competitive basis, with funds going to the districts with the greatest
need and highest quality proposals; (2) requiring local school districts receiving program funds to
develop and implement a rigorous, comprehensive approach to drug and violence prevention
based on proven practices; (3) requiring every school district receiving funds to have a full-time
program coordinator; and (4) requiring all schools to issue report cards that include data on
crime, disorder, and substance abuse.

         D. Class Size Reduction. We would include authorization for our Class Size Reduction
initiative in our ESEA package, since the provisions in last year's Omnibus Appropriations Act
provide funding and authority for only one year. Although we do not expect Congress to enact
the ESEA reauthorization this year, we believe that transmitting authorization legislation will
strengthen our ability to fight for additional funds for class size reduction in the FY2000
appropriations bill. . Unlike the provision enacted last year, our original proposal required local
school districts to provide matching funds (an average of 20%, with a sliding scale based on
poverty levels). We intend to include the matching requirement in our ESEA authorizing
proposal, so that we can reach our goal of providing 100,000 teachers within 7 years. In all other
respects, our proposal would reflect the agreement reached with Republicans last year, which
itself was fully consistent with our original proposal.

       E. School Modernization. We also intend to include our school modernization
proposal, with only minor changes from the one introduced last year, in our ESEA package.

         F. Ed-Flex. Our proposal to expand Ed-Flex (which gives states the authority to waive
many statutory and regulatory requirements in ESEA) to all 50 states died last year, caught
between Democrats who opposed granting greater flexibility and conservative Republicans who
insisted on a more sweeping block grant proposal. Governors of both parties aggressively
promoted Ed-Flex until the very end of the session, and Governor Carper has indicated that the
NGA will take up the cause again next year. Although we believe we should continue to support
some version of Ed-Flex, we will need to think carefully about the scope of the proposal. We
think it would be a mistake to allow states to waive the social promotion, teacher quality, and

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
class size to 18 in the early grades.

         G. Preschool Education. Our ESEA proposal would retain provisions in current law
allowing the use of Title 1 funds for pre-school, and would expand the Even Start Family
Literacy program to reach greater numbers of children and adults. We also would strengthen the
quality of pre-school programs and enhance school readiness by providing funds to local school
districts, on a competitive basis, to (1) work with Head Start and other pre-school programs to
identify the basic language and literacy skills that children need when they enter school and to
design a curriculum to help students acquire these skills; and (2) provide professional
development for child care providers and other providers of early childhood services to help
children build these basic language and literacy skills.

IV. The future of Goals 2000 and continuing support for standards-based reform.

        Goals 2000 has been the flagship Administration initiative promoting standards-based
refonn, and recent studies show that it has been successful. We do not believe we should let the
program expire simply because of the political opposition it faces in Congress. At the same time,
we do not believe it is wise -- either for substantive or for political reasons -- to submit a
proposal that simply extends the current program. We are instead looking for a way to advance
standards-based refonn in a somewhat different fonn -- a kind of second-generation proposal that
will reflect the current state of the standards movement.

        Most educators agree that while states have made significant gains in developing
standards, they still face great challenges in actually putting those standards into place in the
classroom. To meet these challenges, schools must have talented and well-prepared teachers,
who themselves have the tools - curriculum materials, instructional approaches, technology,
and the like - to engage all students in learning to higher standards.

        Several currently existing fonnula grant programs - Goals 2000, the Eisenhower
Professional Development program, and the Title VI Block Grant -- could contribute to this
objective. We are considering a number of approaches involving these programs, including
proposals to consolidate some or all of them into a larger program, which would be designed to
help move standards into the classroom and would have a strong focus on improving teacher
quality. Such a proposal effectively would create a "responsible block grant," with clear
purposes and accountability. Some Congressional Democrats -- including Senator Kennedy --
are also looking at this approach, in part because it would respond to the Republican push for
block grants and in part because it would create a large funding stream to address issues of
teacher quality. We still have much work to do on this issue, and we will outline more concrete
options in a subsequent memo.
