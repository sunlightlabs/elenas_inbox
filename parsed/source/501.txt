MEMORANDUM FOR ALL HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

        Since I signed the historic welfare reform law, I have urged businesses, non-profit
organizations, and religious groups across the nation to help make its promise of opportunity real
by offering jobs to welfare recipients. We are making great progress, but there is more to do.
And today, I take action to ensure that the federal government, in its role as employer, contributes
to the greatest extent possible to this national effort.

        I therefore direct each of you, as head of an agency or department, to use all available
hiring authorities to hire people off the welfare rolls into job positions in the government.

        In particular, I direct you to expand the use of the Worker-Trainee Program and other
excepted service hiring authorities. The Worker-Trainee Program allows agencies to quickly and
easily hire low-skilled persons for up to four years, with the ability to convert the appointment to
career status if the employee has performed satisfactorily. Though recently underutilized, the
program allows agencies to bypass the normal complex hiring procedures of the federal
government to bring people into the most junior grades of the workforce.

       I further direct you, in recognition of the different characteristics of the various agencies'
workforces, to prepare an individualized plan for hiring welfare recipients and to submit that plan
to me within 30 days. This plan should have three principal components.

      The plan should contain a survey of the agency indicating where -- in what components of
       the agency and in what particular positions -- the agency can most easily hire welfare
       recipients. The agency should conduct this survey in consultation with Federal Executive
       Boards and Federal Exec4tive Associations across the country.

      The plan should describe in detail how the agency intends to find qualified welfare
       recipients to place in these positions. The agency should include within this description a
       proposed outreach program to bring federal job opportunities to the attention of welfare
       offices, employment offices, nonprofit organizations, and others that work with the
       welfare population on a regular basis.

      The plan should describe in detail how the agency will ensure that welfare recipients,
       once hired, perform well and keep their jobs. The agency should include in this aspect of
       the plan proposals for training and/or mentoring programs.

       I expect each agency head to report to me about his or her plan at a special cabinet
meeting called for that purpose. Following this meeting, I also expect monthly reports on
implementation.

       To ensure deep and continuing involvement in this issue by the White House, I ask the
Vice President to take on the project of overseeing this effort. Based on his expertise in federal

                                                         AutollUlted Records M~ftA_

        workplace issues, he will assist all agencies in effecting their commitments.

                Finally, I direct appropriate agencies to take three steps that will assist all low-income
        federal employees, whether or not former welfare recipients.

              I direct each agency head to notify all employees eligible for the Earned Income Tax
               Credit (EITC) of both their eligibility and their ability to receive EITC monies each
               month in their paychecks. Currently, not all agencies inform qualifying employees of
               their eligibility and options for payment.
              I direct the General Services Administration (GSA) to issue within 30 days guidelines
               regarding use ofthe Federal Fare Subsidy Program, including the option to offer fare
               subsidies based on the employee's income. This option, which most agencies do not now
               realize they have, will enable more agencies to participate in the Fare Subsidy Program.

              I direct the GSA, after consultation with all federal agencies, to report back to me within
               30 days on plans to assist low-income federal workers in finding affordable child care.
               This report shall include information on agency-sponsored child care centers and agency
               contracts with local child care resource and referral services, as well as recommendations
               on any appropriate expansion of these arrangements to provide assistance to low-income
               federal workers.
