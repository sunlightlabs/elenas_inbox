                                    5/16/97; 2:20 p.m.

   The Labor Department has concluded that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) applies
    to welfare recipients in workfare or other subsidized employment programs in the same
    way as that law applies to all other employees.

   This means that many, ifnot most, welfare recipients in these programs will receive at
    least the minimum wage for their work activities.

   Welfare recipients in these programs will not have to be paid the minimum wage if they
    fall within the FLSA's exception for "trainees." Some states will probably try to structure
    their workfare programs so that recipients fall within the "trainee" exception.

   In most cases in which the minimum wage is required, both cash assistance and food
    stamps will count toward the minimum wage. The Department of Agriculture will take
    necessary administrative action to ensure that food stamps can be counted to the greatest
    degree possible.

   This will not affect the work requirements of the welfare law. States will still be able to
    meet those requirements, by placing people in private sector jobs (where the minimum
    wage already applies) and in workfare programs. With both cash assistance and food
    stamps counting toward the minimum wage, very few states will have to increase their
    assistance payments. In fact, every state but one (Mississippi) can comply with the
    welfare law's current work requirements (now 20 hours per week for a welfare recipient)
    and pay minimum wage without increasing their current benefit level.

   Far from undermining the welfare law, paying welfare recipients the minimum wage
    required by the law promotes the goals of welfare reform by giving people the ability to
    support their families and break the cycle of dependency.

   The Labor Department will provide guidance within the next week or two on the specifics
    of this policy and will engage in extensive consultation with states on how to apply this
    policy with the least disruption.

   The Treasury Department is still exploring how the tax laws apply to welfare recipients in
    workfare programs. We hope to be able to give states an answer to that question very
    shortly.

Question:   Won't this end welfare reform as we know it by making work more expensive?

Answer:     Not at all. With both T ANF and food stamps counting toward the minimum
            wage, every state except Mississippi will be able to give welfare recipients
            workfare slots for 20 hours each week (the welfare law's current work
            requirement) without raising their benefit levels. And of course states should be
            trying to place welfare recipients in private sector jobs where the minimum wage
            already applies.


Question:   Are most welfare recipients who are working going to be considered
            "employees"?

Answer:     Most welfare recipients participating in the work activities described in the new
            welfare law probably will count as "employees," entitled to the minimum wage,
            under the FLSA. But some individuals, engaged in such activities as job search,
            vocational education, and secondary school, may count as "trainees" instead. The
            Labor Department will advise states on how the FLSA applies to particular
            programs ~nd individuals engaged in them.


Question:   What's the difference between a trainee and a worker under FLSA?

Answer:     An individual is in training if:
                  Training is similar to that given in a vocational school;
                  Training is for the benefit of the trainee;
                  Trainees do not displace regular workers;
                  The employer derives no immediate advantage from the trainees'
                   activities;
                  Trainees are not entitled to a job after training is completed; or
                  The employer and trainee understand that the trainee is not paid.


Question:   Can Food Stamps count as wages?

Answer:     We believe that through waivers or other mechanisms such as the Simplified Food
            Program option now in law, states will be able to count food stamps toward the
            minimum wage for all those required to work under the new welfare law.

     Question:   Does this mean welfare recipients in workfare and other subsidized employment
                 programs can unionize?

     Answer:     No -- that is a different question entirely_ Whether and when workers can
                 unionize is a function of the National Labor Relations Act. The National Labor
                 Relations'Board, an independent entity that administers that Act, has not ruled on
                 the unionization question.


     Question:   Would the Administration support or oppose legislation to exempt welfare
                 recipients from the minimum wage laws?

     Answer:     We would oppose legislation that flatly exempts welfare recipients from the
                 minimum wage law. The Administration believes that people who work should
                 be paid at least the minimum wage.


     Question:   Would you oppose any legislation addressing this issue?

     Answer:     Not necessarily, but any legislation would have to be consistent with our support
                 for the minimum wage. In determining how the minimum wage law applies to
                 workfare, the Administration has had to address a host of technical issues that
                 Congress did not deal with in passing the welfare law. If Congress wants to
                 address these issues, the Administration will consider the proposals carefully. But
                 any legislation must reflect the Administration's position that people who work
                 should be paid at least the minimum wage.
