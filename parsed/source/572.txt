MEMORANDUM FOR SYLVIA MATHEWS AND DON BAER

FROM:                     BRUCE REED
                          ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:                  IDEAS


Health and Safety

Patients' Bill of Rights/Quality Commission: The counsel's office is almost done vetting our
nominations for the Quality Commission, which will be charged with developing a Patients' Bill
of Rights. Announcement of the Commission can be combined with the release ofa HHS
regulation that would guarantee an expedited appeal whenever a plan proposes to deny care that a
Medicare patient believes is urgently needed.

Medicare fraud legislation: We have finalized and are ready to announce a new and very good
package of Medicare fraud and abuse initiatives. We can unveil this package during the
President's trip to Florida -- or if it doesn't fit there, we can look for another opportunity to make
the announcement. At the same time, we can underscore our recent successes in prosecuting
fraudulent health care providers.

Medical records privacy: We are working with HHS to develop legislation to ensure
appropriate privacy protections for medical records. The subject is complex, but we have the
discussions on a fast track. We are aiming to have legislation ready within the month.

Business endorsement of kids' coverage: We are working on an event at which important
representatives ofthe business community endorse our proposal to extend health care coverage
for children. We think we can have this event ready sometime in April.

Executive order on displaced workers: We are exploring whether we have legal authority to
issue an executive order granting six months of health care coverage to displaced federal workers
(thus mirroring our budget proposal). We should know within a week or so whether this action is
doable.

Classified research with human subjects: In response to recommendations of the President's
Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, we have prepared (1) an Executive
Order strengthening protections for human subj ects of secret research; and (2) legislation
expanding compensation for Cold War-era uranium miners. With one week's notice, we can be


                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

ready to announce these policies and release a summary report detailing the Administration's full
response to the Committee's 18 recommendations.

Tobacco Advertising: We are reviewing a proposal for the President to take action responding
to tobacco companies' use of the internet and other fora to get around our tobacco regulation.
We could use "Kick Butts" day to announce this proposal, but we should first get DOJ assurance
that this proposal does not compromise our efforts to defend our tobacco regulation in court.

Seat Belt Study: The Department of Transportation will give the President a report in a week or
so on ways to increase seat belt use. DOT's report is likely to include ideas for presidential
challenges to states and business groups, as well as a proposal (consistent with our budget) to
offer financial incentives to states to improve and enforce seat belt laws. We can release the
report when the President meets with Big 3 auto executives. (It is possible that we could
announce at the same event a bigger safety initiative: the addition of language to our NEXTEA
proposal sanctioning states that don't have tough seatbelt laws. Secretary Slater is currently
considering whether to support sending this language to Congress.)

Aggressive drivers/driver emergency number: DOT is working on a package of proposals to
deal with aggressive drivers; we expect to get the package within 10 days. But DOT thinks the
package will seem skimpy and that it may provoke safety advocates to say that the real problem
is the speed limit. DOT has suggested as an alternative an action creating a uniform emergency
number for cellular phones. DOT thinks such an action can be ready by May.

Children's Health EO: The DPC, NEC, CEQ, and OSTP are working on an executive order
designed to ensure that the federal government considers the special needs of children when
taking regulatory action. The executive order requires every agency to determine whether a
regulation may impose disproportionate risks on children and, if so, to evaluate the specific
effects of the regulation on children. Several agencies have raised serious last-minute objections,
but we are hoping that we can work these out in the next few weeks.

Education

Testing in military schools: Scheduled for tomorrow.

School construction event. Scheduled for this Friday.

Teachers package. We discussed unveiling this package during our trip to North Carolina, but
decided not to do so. The President would call on state legislatures around the country to enact
major pay incentives for master teachers; explain how our proposed budget will help set a new
national standard of excellence in teaching; and issue a number of invitations and challenges.

State School Officer Endorsements: We are lining up endorsements for next Monday's
meeting with Chief State School Officers. We'll know by the end of the week where we stand.



                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

California Endorsement of Testing Plan: California's superintendent, Delaine Eastin, is
prepared to endorse our testing proposal, and a group of Silicon Valley high-tech executives are
prepared to do so as well. We could do a good event during the President's visit March 24.
California's endorsement is very important, since the state has 10-15% of the country's
schoolchildren.

Advisory Panel for Education Tests: The Education Department is thinking about the
appropriate structure and composition of a panel of teachers and other trusted educators to advise
on the development of our 4th and 8th grade tests. (The Department may decide to use an
existing, non-governmental group to perform this function.) We expect a decision in a few
weeks.

Teacher of the Year. The President will meet with the Teacher of the Year and other
outstanding teachers at the White House on April 15. He may be able to announce that the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards has selected additional master teachers.

Rollout of America Reads and Hope Scholarship. The President can announce the transmittal
of these two pieces of legislation.

Roundtable on Standards. The President could participate in a session with teachers, students,
parents, and others to explain the standards associated with his 4th and 8th grade tests. The
roundtable would demonstrate with concrete examples the kind of student work -- and the kind
of teaching -- that reflects high standards.

Agency sponsorship of charter schools: We can set a process in motion for federal agencies --
for example, NASA or the NSF -- to sponsor charter schools in partnership with teams of
teachers. We should keep this project small at the start and focus it on DC. It will probably take
us three or four months to be ready to announce the first sponsorship.

Incentives for engineering: We are currently exploring whether we can take executive action
(or should propose legislation) providing monetary incentives for students to take engineering
courses. We wiII know more within a week.

Welfare

Welfare-to-Work Transportation Plan: We announced today our Access to Jobs proposal,
which would allocate $100 milIion ofISTEA funding to improve transportation systems so that
welfare recipients and other low·income workers could get to work more easily. We are .
currently exploring whether we can take an executive action that would call further attention to
these efforts. We should know in a week or two.

Child Support: We can announce new child support enforcement numbers, along with the
submission of a new HHS report on child support enforcement and our submission of legislation


                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

(previously announced) to make it a felony to cross state lines to evade child support obligations.

Statutory Rape/Teen Pregnancy Prevention: DOJ should be ready sometime in April to
rele"ase a report on statutory rape and its relation to teen pregnancy rates. We could do a radio
address timed to coincide with the release of this report, discussing strategies to enforce statutory
rape laws and decrease teen pregnancies.

Internet in welfare offices: We are currently exploring ways to increase the access of welfare
offices around the country to internet, with its wide range of job databanks. We may ask Eli
Segal's organization to play some role in this effort. We will have a proposal within a week or
two.

Crime and Drugs

Hard Liquor Advertising. For years, the hard liquor industry has voluntarily agreed not to
show liquor ads on TV. Some companies have now broken that agreement. In furtherance of his
National Drug Control Strategy roll-out, the President could send a letter to the FCC requesting
that they consider restrictions on hard liquor advertising on television during certain time
periods.

Sex Offender Registry. The President could visit the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children in Arlington, Virginia where he would take a tour of facility and announce
that the interim National Sex Offender Registration system -- which he directed the Attorney
General to develop in the June 21, 1996 Radio Address -- is now up and running. He also would
announce that he is signing an Executive Order instructing the Attorney General and the
Secretary of Defense to ensure that sex offenders released from Federal and Military prisons are
listed in the national registry.

National Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The President's FY 98 Budget Submission includes
$175 million for a national anti-drug media campaign directed towards our youth. We will not be
able to expend any funds on this initiative until we enact the appropriation bill, but ONDCP can
expend discretionary funds in its FY 97 budget to begin producing anti-drug ads. At a Rose
Garden event, the President could kick off his Administration's anti-drug media campaign with
one of the celebrities who has committed to appear in an ad. The President could also release a
letter that he is sending to every network issuing his challenge that they match our contribution
and begin dedicating more air time to anti-drug ads. ONDCP is currently reaching out to
celebrities and sports figures such as Michael Jordan, Grant Hill, and Tiger Woods to tape anti-
drug ads, and this event should be ready sometime in April.

Anti-Gang Prosecutor Event. The cornerstone of the President's Anti-Gang and Youth
Violence Strategy is a $200 million anti-gang prosecution grant program. The President could
meet with prosecutors from across the country in the Oval Office where they would thank him
for his strong support in fighting gangs. The prosecutors -- Republican and Democrat -- would



                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                                                          5

     urge Congress to move quickly to pass the President's bill. We recommend April for this event.

     After-school initiative event. To highlight his new after-schools initiatives in the Anti-Gang
     Bill, the President could visit a successful after-school program and meet with the kids helped by
     the program. That day, he also would announce that HHS is providing several million dollars in
     grants from its FY 97 appropriation for new after-school programs across the country. This event
     should occur after the anti-gang event described above.

     Victims Constitutional Amendment. In June 1996, the President announced his support for a
     constitutional amendment for victims rights -- to guarantee victims the right to be notified, to
     receive restitution, receive reasonable protection measures, and to be heard at sentencing and
     parole hearings. At a White House event, the President could: (1) urge Congress to pass the
     Amendment quickly; (2) receive a report from the Attorney General -- in response to his June
     25, 1996 Directive -- outlining measures taken by the Justice Department to increase and
     improve Federal services and protections for victims of crime; (3) announce the creation of a
     Federal victim notification system; and (4) announce additional funding from the Victims Crime
     Fund -- which is larger than ever before -- that will be provided to victims services and shelters
     throughout the country. This event could occur on April 19, the third anniversary of the
     Oklahoma City bombing or during April 14-18, which is National Crime Victims Week.

     Nanny checks: We could introduce legislation prepared by the Justice Department that would
     facilitate criminal checks for non-criminal purposes -- for example, a check on a potential nanny
     or schoolbus driver. But we oversold the Oprah bill a couple of years ago as a solution to this
     problem; if we do another big event, we will have to admit that our purported solution didn't do
     much of anything.

     Family

     Family leave executive order: We think we have legal authority to issue an executive order
     granting federal employees the additional family leave provided in our legislative proposal. We
     will have a final answer on this proposal within the week.

     Child care centers: Ideas proposed to us last week on child care would be either ineffectual or
     prohibitively expensive. We are continuing to look for sensible policy initiatives.

     Service Summit

     Scholars' Program: We announced last year a $1,000 scholarship for high school students who
     have performed outstanding service, with the federal government putting up $500 and a
     community or service organization (e.g., Lions, Elks, Kiwanis, Moose) putting up the rest. We
     can be ready any time to do an event inviting high schools that have obtained matching funds to
     submit names of candidates for the scholarship (perhaps in conjunction with a letter from the
     President to every high school principal).


                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                                                             6

          Commitments/Adopt-a-School: We could announce "commitments" from the federal
          government to the service summit -- proposals for how the federal government can support
          service and voluntarism to help youth. We could be ready to make such announcements in 2-3
          weeks if necessary. One possible commitment would involve agencies adopting schools --
          offering literacy services, donating computers, doing career days, etc.

          Environment (see also CEQ memo)

          Brownfields: The EPA wants to rollout an expansion of the existing Brownfields pilot program
          in about two months. The Administration will also resubmit legislation creating a new tax
          incentive and grant program to encourage the redevelopment of Brownfields.

          Right-to-know law: EPA should be ready in about two months to issue a rule extending
          disclosure obligations under the right-to-know law to a number of additional industries --
          probably including mining, hazardous waste handlers, and utilities.

          Safe water regulations: EPA will propose regulations to require water utilities to provide
          information to consumers about what is in tap water. The proposal will not be ready until
          September or so.




                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
