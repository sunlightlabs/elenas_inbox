Question:   Are you going to submit additional Medicare savings so that your Medicare
            plan will contain $100 billion in savings over five years?

Answer:     Our actuaries believe that our current Medicare proposal does save $100 billion
            over five years. And, over the last four years, our actuaries have been more
            accurate in their budget estimates than the Congressional Budget Office.
            Moreover, just last week we sent our detailed language over to CBO. We believe
            that these additional details will help eliminate some of the current discrepancies
            between our actuaries' scoring of our Medicare proposal and CBO scoring. If any
            scoring differences still remain after CBO has had a chance to review all of our
            statutory language, we will make a determination as to whether any revisions in
            our proposal are warranted.


Question:   In your February budget release you said the 5-year Medicare savings were
            $100 billion. There are now reports that it is $106 billion over five years,
            according to your actuaries. How do you account for these differences?

Answer:     As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was scoring our Medicare proposals,
            they requested that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide
            clarifications on the intent of our savings proposals. After providing them with
            this information, we asked OMB to determine how these clarifications changed
            the scoring of our Medicare package on our baseline. When they did, OMB
            determined that the provisions would score about $106 billion in savings off of
            our baseline. (None of the clarifications involved beneficiary savings.)

            CBO continues to score our proposals to save about $82 billion off of their
            baseline. We hope that further clarification of our policy will close the gap
            between how CBO ($82 billion) and OMB ($106 billion) score the very same
            policy.


Question:   Do you plan to eliminate any of the new benefit improvements in your
            Medicare plan?

Answer:     While everything will clearly be "on the table" in our budget discussions, we are
            extremely sensitive about making any changes to the important beneficiary
            improvements in our Medicare plan. Over three quarters of Medicare
            beneficiaries earn less than $25,000 per year. Improving benefits and fixing flaws
            in the program which place undue costs on this vulnerable population is a high
            priority for this Administration. We look forward to continuing to work with both
            Republicans and Democrats in Congress on passing a balanced budget which will


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion




                  strengthen and improve the Medicare program.


      Question:   Your proposal to lower out-of-pocket costs for outpatient department (OPD)
                  services costs almost 50 billion over ten years. How do you justify the costs of
                  this proposal?

      Answer:     Our OPD policy simply returns the benefit to the original intent of the
                  program. This policy is in no way a new entitlement. Under current law,
                  Medicare asks beneficiaries to pay 20 percent copayments for Medicare services.
                  An anomaly in outpatient payment methodologies has allowed hospitals to
                  indirectly cost shift to beneficiaries. As a result, beneficiary copayments are now
                  averaging almost 50 percent. The President's proposal simply restores the
                  copayment to 20 percent -- similar to all other Part B services.

                  The current 50 percent coinsurance costs are significant for Medicare
                  benefi.ciaries. Over three quarters of Medicare beneficiaries earn less than
                  $25,000 per year. Those without Medigap insurance or other secondary insurance
                  simply cannot afford the huge unexpected bills they receive for OPD services.
                  Those with Medigap coverage have seen their premiums increase as a result of
                  this anomaly. It is only fair that this benefit, like all other Part B services, have a
                  20 percent coinsurance.

                  Our OPD policies achieve savings. Reducing the coinsurance to 20 percent is
                  only one part of our proposal to improve OPDs. The President's budget also
                  shifts OPDs to a prospective payment system which will provide financial
                  incentives for hospital to reduce costs and simplify payments, achieving at least
                  $19 billion in savings over the next ten years.


      Question:   Why are the costs in your OPD proposal backended? Aren't you just
                  playing political games to balance the budget in 2002?

      Answer:     The cost of buying down the OPD copayment is split between hospitals and the
                  Federal govenm1ent. We felt that an immediate move to a 20 percent copayment
                  might create difficult transitions for hospitals who will already be targeted for
                  reductions in payments from other policies. Having said this, we are more than
                  willing to discuss alternative ways to address this problem.




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dwnp Conversion




     Question:   Your Medicare proposal contains mostly cuts on providers and managed
                 care. Don't you think we need real structural Medicare reform?

     Answer:     Absolutely. My budget takes important steps to modernize Medicare and
                 bring it into the 21st century through a number of structural reforms
                 including

                      Establishing new private plans -- including Preferred Provider
                       Organizations and Provider Sponsored Organizations -- available to
                       seniors and people with disabilities.
                      Establishing market-oriented purchasing for Medicare including the new
                       prospective payment systems for home health care, nursing home care, and
                       outpatient hospital services, as well as competitive bidding authority and
                       the use of centers of excellence to improve quality and cut back on costs.

                      Adding new Medigap protections to make it possible for beneficiaries to
                                      switch back from a managed care plan to traditional
                                      Medicare without being underwritten by insurers for private
                                      supplemental insurance coverage. This should encourage
                                      more beneficiaries to opt for managed care because it
                                      addresses the fear that such a choice would lock them in
                                      forever.


     Question:   Do you support the Medicare Commission proposed by Senators Roth and
                 Moynihan?

                      First, I want to praise Chairman Roth and Ranking Member
                       Moynihan for working together -- on a bipartisan basis -- to propose
                       the creation of a commission to address the long-term financing issues
                       that face Medicare. Their efforts reflect a bipartisan spirit which we
                       believe is critical to ensure the success of any process designed to
                       address this important issue.

                      No one is more committed than I am to seeking a bipartisan process to
                       find long term solutions to Medicare. But my more immediate focus is
                       reaching a bipartisan agreement on a balanced budget that extends
                       the life of the Medicare Trust Fund in the near term. We have an
                       historic opportunity to balance the budget. We should not let it pass.

                      As I have repeatedly said, we will need a bipartisan process to address the
                       long-term financing issues facing Medicare, and I look forward to working
                       with both parties to develop the best possible process.

Question:   What will this commission hope to accomplish?

Answer:     The President is calling on the commission to develop a "consumer bill of rights."
             He wants it to particularly focus on consumer appeals and grievance rights. He
            has also asked the Commission to address other issues including assuring:

               First, that health care professionals are free to provide the best medical advice
               possible;

               Second, that their providers are not subject to inappropriate financial
               incentives to limit care;

               Third, that our sickest and most vulnerable patients (frequently the elderly and
               people with disabilities) are receiving the best medical care for their unique
               needs;

               Fourth, that consumers have access to simple and fair procedures for resolving
               health care coverage dispute plans;

               And fifth, and perhaps most important, that consumers have basic information
               about their rights and responsibilities, about the benefits plans offer, about
               how to access the care they need, and about the quality of their providers and
               their health plan.


Question:   Will the patient bill of rights be mandated on states and private health plans?

Answer:     No. The Commission will develop a model Bill of Rights that states, health
            care plans, health care providers, associations, and others can use to guide
            their own efforts. States have already been quite active in this area and the
            model should help them in future efforts. Many health plans and health care
            professionals have adopted a form of a bill of rights and this should assist
            them as well.


Question:   Is this an "anti-managed care" commission?

Answer:     Absolutely not. Quality and consumer rights are issues that transcend all
            models of care. We need to address those issues in a comprehensive manner
            so that no matter what kind of insurance plan Americans join, they will
            know that the care they receive is of the highest quality and their rights as




                                                               Automated Records Management System

Question:   Won't the commission serve to delay quality legislative initiatives including
            those that even the President has advocated? Isn't the commission going to
            compete with these initiatives?

Answer:     This commission will complement, not compete with, legislation in the
            Congress that has broad-based support. The President will continue to
            support legislation in this area that has already received bipartisan support
            (e.g., barring gag rules, requiring 48-hour stays for women who have
            mastectomies). But this is just a start, we must go beyond these reforms to
            take a comprehensive look at the quality of care and how we can assure it.
            The Commission will work on building the consensus for more far-reaching
            reforms.


Question:   Doesn't this commission just serve as a mechanism to implement more
            government regulation in our health care system?

Answer:     Not at all. The Commission has been given the charge of examining whether
            our rapidly changing health care system is still providing high quality care
            for all Americans and to ensure that consumers themselves have adequate
            grievances and appeals processes. Its focus is to help create consensus among
            the private and public sectors in how best to proceed. As such, its
            recommendations mayor may not suggest additional Federal oversight
            activities, and it is just as likely as not that it will recommend no new major
            Federal role.


Question:   Doesn't this commission just a reward for campaign contributors and
            Washington-insiders who know little about what Americans in our health
            care system experience?

Answer:     Absolutely not. By any measure, these commission members are extremely
            well respected experts who have broad and different experiences in the
            health care system. They have expertise on a range of health care issues
            including the unique challenges facing rural and urban communities,
            children, women, older Americans, minorities, people with disabilities,
            mental illness and AIDS, as well as issues regarding privacy rights and
            ethics. They come from all parts of the country and reflect the diverse
            population in this country.

Answer:       The Commission will cost an estimated $1.8 million over the next year and be
              paid for by the Department of Health and Human Services. The members of
              the Commission will not be paid.




            WELFARE REFORM: FOOD STAMP WORK REQUIREMENT

Question:     Under the new welfare law, states began to cut off food stamps for
              non-disabled adults who aren't working after three months of
              benefits. Why does the Administration want to soften these
              provisions?

Answer:      I strongly support work requirements. But the.welfare law's harsh and
             unreasonable time limit of 3 months in 36 cuts off people who want to work but
             can't find jobs. In my budget, I proposed an alternative: a real and tough work
             requirement without arbitrary cut-offs.

             Under my proposal, those who refused to work or refused to take advantage of a
             work opportunity would face tough new penalties. We would limit food stamps to
             6 months out of 12. This policy would encourage work while giving those out of
             work the transitory help they need to get back on their feet. We proposed new
             funding and a wage supplementation option to expand the number of work slots
             available to this group by nearly 400,000 over five years. I am looking forward to
             working with Congress to enact this sensible proposal.

Background:

     As of March 1, states began to cut off food stamp benefits for people who have not met
      the new work requirement in the welfare law.

     Under the law, able-bodied childless adults between the ages of 18-50 are not permitted
      to get food stamps for more than 3 months in a 3-year period, unless they are working at
      least 20 hours a week.

     USDA can waive the work requirement in cities or counties with high unemployment. To
      date, USDA has granted waivers to 36 states that exempt specified counties or cities with
      high unemployment.

     Despite these exemptions, approximately 500,000 individuals will lose their food
      stamp eligibility in FY98 due to this provision. Under the Administration's
      proposal, approximately 35,000 individuals would lose eligibility in FY98. Unlike

                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
individuals who are unwilling to work and to play by the rules.

Question:    Immigrants shouldn't be coming to the U.S. to get on welfare. Why
             is the Administration making restoration of these benefits a priority?

Or alternative question:

            Around the country, hundreds of thousands of frightened, elderly
            legal immigrants are scrambling to become citizens and avert a cut-
            off of their SSI and Medicaid benefits. What is the Administration
            doing about this?

Answer:     I believe that legal immigrants should have the same opportunity, and
            bear the same responsibility, as other members of our society. The
            welfare law denies most legal immigrants access to fundamental safety
            net programs unless they become citizens -- even though they are in the
            U.S. legally, are working and paying taxes and are responsible members
            of our communities. My Administration has always supported making
            individuals who encourage their relatives to emigrate to the United States
            resp~nsible for the immigrant's well being. However, as a nation, we
            should not turn our backs on anyone who has lost their ability to earn a
            living due to injury, disease, or illness.

            Consequently, my budget proposes to make legal immigrants who
            become disabled after entering the United States eligible for SSI and
            Medicaid.

            My budget would also provide poor immigrant children the same Medicaid
            health care coverage low-income citizen children receive.

            The United States admits refugees and asylees into this country on a
            humanitarian basis. My budget proposes to lengthen the five-year
            exemption for refugees from the ban from five to seven years in order to
            give this group adequate time to naturalize.

            Finally, the law denies food stamps to most legal immigrants. My budget
            would delay the cutoffs from April 1, 1997 to August, 1997 in order to give
            immigrants more time to naturalize.




                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

Question:   You say you are ready to work with Congress to fix the immigrant and food
            stamp parts of the welfare law, but the Republican leadership says the bill is
            fine as it is. Even some Democrats are saying the law shouldn't be changed
            until we have had a chance to see how it works. Doesn't this mean your
            proposals have no chance of being enacted?

Answer:     I think it is very significant that the nation's Governors are now on record as
            recognizing that the cuts in benefits to legal immigrants are too harsh and need to
            be addressed -- even though their final resolution was softened at the last minute
            at the request of the Congressional leadership.

            As the new welfare law is being implemented, the Governors are gaining a new
            appreciation of some parts of the bill that I have had a problem with from the
            beginning -- those parts that are not related to putting people to work. This is
            particularly true of those Governors in states with large numbers of legal
            immigrants. They are now looking more carefully at their state budgets and the
            fact that many legal immigrants who are disabled, many in nursing homes, will
            lose their SSI and Medicaid over the summer. In addition to noting that these
            provisions are unfair, they can see the potential costs to their own state budgets if
            they make the decision to ameliorate those cuts.

            I think that, over time, more and more people will come to see the harm that these
            provisions could do to hard-working people who came to this country and,
            through no fault of their own, became disabled and could no longer support their
            families.

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

DISPLACEMENT

Question:   Aren't you concerned that welfare recipients will displace hardworking Americans --
            people who played by the rules and never relied on welfare? Recent stories in The
            Washington Post and The New York Times have provided anecdotal evidence that
            welfare recipients are taking jobs from the working poor.

Answer.     Let me note that the welfare reform law that I signed prohibits worker
            disp lacement. Welfare reform programs cannot place welfare recipients in job
            openings created by company firings or layoffs (section 407(f) of the law) ..
            Welfare recipients can, however, be placed in jobs that are vacant for reasons
            other than firings or layoffs.

            I believe that the growing economy will create enough jobs to meet my goal of
            putting one million welfare recipients to work by the year 2000 without displacing
            other workers. Remember, we've created 12 million new jobs over the last four
            years. Unemployment has dropped to 5.2 percent, as was announced on Friday.

            I recognize that we should give some extra help to communities where it will be
            harder for welfare recipients to find jobs. That's why I've proposed in my budget
            a $3 billion Welfare-to-Work Jobs Challenge fund which states and cities could
            use to create job opportunities for welfare recipients.


MINIMUM WAGE

Question:   Some say displacement will happen because welfare recipients are allowed to
            work without being covered by the minimum wage law and the various
            protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Is this true?

Answer:     Agency lawyers are in the course of examining to what extent the Fair Labor
            Standards Act applies to welfare to work programs. We expect to have an answer
            shortly, but do not have one at this time.

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

        PRIVATIZING WELFARE

        Question:   Are you planning to let Texas privatize welfare? I understand you met with                 labol

        Answer:     No decision has been made on the Texas request. It is a complicated issue
                    involving both Medicaid and Food Stamps. The agencies are working as hard as
                    they can to examine all of the relevant issues, and we hope to get the State of
                    Texas their answer soon. I can tell you this: my Administration has fought hard to
                    preserve federal guarantees for both Food Stamps and Medicaid and we don't
                    intend to undermine them now. Regarding the meeting I had with labor leaders on
                    March 28th -- it was a broad discussion of budget and welfare to work issues.

        Question:   Governor Bush is, in effect, calling Secretary Shalala a liar for' not making a
                    decision by Aprill, as she had promised.

        Answer:     He knows better than that. The Administration gets a lot of waiver requests from
                    the states. The agencies conduct a routine review process for each ofthem.
                    Because this is a complicated issue, the review has been lengthy, probably a little
                    more than we expected. But the agencies are working to provide Texas with a
                    response as soon as possible.

        PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS

        Question:   What are you doing to encourage private companies to hire welfare
                    recipients without displacing current workers?

        Answer:     The $3 billion Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge I propose in my budget could be
                    used by cities and states to provide subsidies and other incentives for private
                    businesses to add welfare recipients to their workforce. Complementing this
                    initiative is the enhanced and expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit that I also
                    propose in my budget. First, the WOTC would be enhanced for long-term welfare
                    recipients. This credit would allow employers who hire welfare recipients to claim
                    a 50 percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid to that person for two
                    years. Wages may include the cost of training, health insurance, and day care.
                    Second, the WOTC would be expanded to make a new population -- 18-50
                    year olds made ineligible for food stamps under the new welfare law --
                    eligible for the existing base credit.

                           In addition to my legislative proposals, I am reaching out to employers
                    large and small to challenge them to hire welfare recipients. I met in the White
                    House with a group of 14 CEOs interested in helping people move from welfare
                    to work. Then, during the State of the Union Address, I announced commitments
                    from five of these companies -- Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United
                    Airlines. I hope to be announcing commitments from even more companies soon.

                                                                                  H~x-P\llllp Conversion

Question:   What has the White House done to encourage federal government hiring of
            welfare recipie.nts?

Answer:     Most of the jobs required to make welfare refonn succeed will come from the
            private sector. But I believe that the Federal Government, as the Nation's largest
            employer, should contribute to this critical national effort. That's why on March
            8th, I directed the head of each federal agency and department to use all available
            hiring authorities to hire people off the welfare rolls into available job positions in
            the Government. To underscore the importance of this issue to the White House, I
            appointed Vice President Gore to oversee this effort.

            I have called a Cabinet meeting for this Thursday, April 10th, to meet face to face
            with the members of my .Cabinet to discuss how each agency intends to recruit,
            hire, and retain qualified welfare recipients.

Question:   Will the White House hire any welfare recipients?

Answer:     I expect the Executive Office of the President, like any other agency, to produce a
            detailed plan to assist in this effort and I would fully expect them to plan to hire
            welfare recipients.

                                              NEEDLE EXCHANGE

             Question:   Will you work to lift the ban on federal funding of needle exchange programs?

             Answer:     Not at this time. As you know, the congressional ban remains in effect until the
                         Secretary ofHHS can certify that needle programs reduce the transmission of
                         AIDS and that such programs do not encourage illicit drug use. The scientific
                         studies done so far provide strong evidence that needle exchange programs reduce
                         HIV transmission, but they don't offer sufficient evidence of the effect of these
                         programs on illicit drug use. We strongly support continued study of this question
                         so we can know whether needle exchange programs in fact encourage drug use.
                         In the meantime, local communities remain free, as they should, to establish and
                         support needle exchange programs if they choose to do so.

                                   PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION

      Question:   Didn't you base your veto of the partial-birth abortion bill on false information--
                  i.e., that this procedure is performed only on a few hundred women in desperate
                  circumstances?

      Answer:     No. I based my veto on the fact that there are a small group of women in
                  desperate circumstances who need this procedure in order to save their lives or
                  prevent serious injury to their health. I've never said that these are the only
                  circumstances in which the procedure is used. Indeed, I've acknowledged that
                  there are cases where the procedure is not necessary for life or serious health
                  reasons -- and I've made very clear that I would sign legislation banning the
                  procedure in those cases.


      Question:   If Congress were to add a health exception to the partial birth bill you vetoed last
                  year, that bill would prohibit all partial birth abortions -- including pre-viability
                  partial birth abortions -- that aren't done for life or serious health reasons. Are
                  you really saying that you would sign a bill of that kind -- a bill that prohibited a
                  particular procedure (except if done for life or serious health reasons) in the pre-
                  viability period?

      Answer:     I have made very clear my condition for signing the partial birth bill. I told
                  Congress that I would sign the bill ifit protected women who needed the
                  procedure to save their lives or avert serious harm to their health. I implored
                  Congress to send me such a bill. I continue to take that position. If Congress adds
                  a provision to the bill that protects women who need the procedure for life or
                  serious health reasons, I will sign that bill.
