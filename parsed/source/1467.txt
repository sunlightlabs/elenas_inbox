 CHILD TAX CREDIT

                                         A Fact Sheet
                                          July 10, 1997

The President's child tax credit includes the following features:

Age:
       Covers children under 17 through 2002.
       After 2002, covers children under 19.


Amount per-child:
       $400 in 1998
       $500 in 1999 and then indexed for inflation.


Income Limits:
       Phased out for families with incomes between $60,000 and $75,000 until 2000.

       After 2000, the phase-out range is raised to between $80,000 and $100,000 and then
        indexed for inflation.


Refundability to Cover Out-of-Pocket Income and Payroll Taxes:
       Working families who payout of pocket federal taxes would benefit from the child tax
        credit. The child tax credit is calculated before the EITe and will be partially refundable.
         A family will get a child credit for their income taxes plus the extent to which their out-
        of-pocket (employee share) payroll taxes exceed their EITe.


Savings Incentive Feature:
       Taxpayers who are entitled to a child credit would have the opportunity to contribute
        their child tax credit plus an additional $500 per-child each year to a Kidsave Account
        for the child's education, first time home purchase, or the taxpayer's retirement.
        Earnings would accumulate tax-free in the account and no taxes would be due upon
        withdrawal for these purposes.


Cost:
       $70.2 billion over 1997-2002.

       $176.1 billion over 1997-2007.

       $22.0 billion in 2007.

                       Play by the Rules Deserve a Tax Cut Too

Compared to the President's proposal, the Senate bill denies the child credit to 3.8 million families who
make less than $30,000. The House bill denies the child tax credit to 4.8 million of these families. The
President strongly believes families who work hard, pay taxes, and play by the rules deserve a tax cut
too.                                                      .

Examples of working families who receive a tax cut under President Clinton's plan but are
shortchanged by Congressional plans:



Example #1: A Family Like Police Officer Daniel Mercado's
Consider a family like Police Officer Daniel Mercado's of Savannah, Georgia. A family like his with
two parents, four children, and an income of $26,000 would receive a $],238 child tax credit under
President Clinton's proposal, but would not receive a child tax credit under the House or Senate bills.

         Federal Tax Situation Before Any Child Tax Credit/I:
         Income taxes owed before EITC                                         $285
         Payroll taxes (just employee share)                                  $1,989

         Federal out-of-pocket taxes owed before EITC                         $2,674

         Employer share of payroll taxes                                      $1,989

         Federal taxes before ErTC                                            $4,663
         Benefit from EITC                                                    $1,036




                                              President Clinton's          House Bill                Senate Bill
                                                   Proposal
              Child Tax Credit for
              family with two                        $1,238                     $0                        $0
              parents and four kids
              and income of $26,000



Notes:
I:       Source: U.S. Department of Treasury. Assumes 1999 tax parameters.
2:       Estimate calculated from Congressional Budget Office Data. CBO estimates that in 1998, families with incomes
         between $20,000 and $30,000 would pay 1.54 percent of their income in federal excise taxes.




                                                                  Automated Records Management System

Consider a family like Michelle Orticke's, a receptionist from Springfield, Virginia. A family like hers
with a mother and two children and an income of$24,000 would receive a $1,000 child tax credit
under President's Clinton's proposal. A family like this one would receive a smaller $651 child tax
credit under the Senate bill and would receive no child tax credit under the House bill.

Using the Treasury individual income tax model, an estimate was generated for the aggregate numbers
of taxpayers in 1998 with Adjusted Gross Income below $30,000 who receive the child tax credit under
President Clinton's proposal but not under the House and Senate bills. These aggregates were
distributed across states in proportion to the fraction ofEITC recipients nationwide in 1995 with
incomes between $15,000 and $30,000 who reside in the particular state. EITC recipients with incomes
between $15,000 and $30,000 form the group primarily affected by the differences in the child tax
credit proposals.
