                             The Commerce Committee Manager's Package
                               will Dramatically Reduce Youth Smoking

      The Commerce Committee manager's package contains significant improvements over the
      underlying bill which will help to reduce youth smoking and to protect the public health. With
      these improvements, the bill meets each of the President's principles for comprehensive tobacco
      legislation. The improvements include:

      Tougher Lookback Surcharges:

             The manager's amendment contains an uncapped company-specific surcharge of$I,OOO
              per youth smoker for every youth smoker by which the company misses its youth
              smoking targets. This surcharge represents twice the lifetime profits that a company
              earns from any youth smoker. The companies will not be able to pass these company-
              specific surcharges onto price, because any price differential between companies will
            , dramatically affect their share of the adult market.

             At the levels specified in the manager's amendment, company specific surcharges will
             reduce profits by $640 million for every 10 points. The Treasury Department and OMB
             estimate that a 20-point miss in 2003 would represent one-third of total industry profits.
             By affecting their bottom line in this dramatic fashion, the company-specific surcharges
             in the manager's amendment will provide a significant incentive for tobacco companies
             to change their behavior and reduce sales to children.

            The manager's package also raises the cap on industry-wide lookback surcharges from
             $3.5 billion per year to $4 billion per year. The Treasury Department and OMB estimate
             that if targets are not met and the full $4 billion industry-wide surcharge is levied, the
             price of a pack of cigarettes will rise by about 35 cents.

      Enhanced Environmental Tobacco Smoke Protections:

            The manager's package provides that a state can opt out of the national environmental
             tobacco smoke standard only if the state is able to demonstrate to OSHA that it has an
             ETS standard at least as protective of the public's health.

      Spending:

            The manager's package contains key provisions to fund important public health
             programs, health research, and assistance for farmers. It also provides funding to states to
             be used for a variety of programs, including child care.

            Approximately 22 percent of expected revenues from the legislation will go to fund
             research at Nlli, CDC, and AHCPR. Another 22 percent will fund smoking cessation
             programs, prevention and education programs, international tobacco control efforts, and a
             variety of enforcement efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize smuggling

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                           2

           and crack down on retailers who sell tobacco products to children. All proceeds from
           lookback penalties will go to prevention and education programs.

          Forty percent of expected revenues will go to states, with half unrestricted and half to be
           used for designated purposes -- the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the Safe
           and Dmg-Free Schools Program, Eisenhower Grants, child welfare programs (Title IV-
           B), the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Title V Program, Substance Abuse grant
           programs, and a limited match for the Children's Health Insurance Program. This entire
           list is directed at the health and well-being of children and families most in need of
           assistance.

          The remainder of expected revenues from the legislation will go to protect tobacco
           farmers and to provide assistance to their communities, through the mechanisms of the
           LEAF Act.

         Excess revenues will go to the Medicare program.

    Improved Liability Provisions:

         The manager's package ensures that the bill's liability provisions (i.e., the settlement of
          state lawsuits and the annual damages cap) apply only to companies that agree to accept
          sweeping advertising restrictions and to comply with important provisions of the law (i.e.,
          lookbacks and annual payments), even if those provisions are invalidated by the courts.

         The manager's package raises the annual liability cap from $6.5 to $8 billion (indexed for
          inflation), the same amount as the cap in the Chafee-Harkin bill. It also removes liability
          protections for parent companies and affiliates; ensures that the industry's attorneys wilI
          be subject to suit as under current law; and allows plaintiffs claiming injury from disease
          to use evidence of addiction in their lawsuits.

         The manager's package strengthens the provisions in the bill that link liability protections
          to the achievement of youth smoking targets. Under the amended legislation, a company
          that misses its targets by 20 percent or more has the burden of showing both that it did not
          engage in affirmative misconduct and that it used best efforts to reduce youth smoking in
          order to escape the loss of liability protections.

    Elimination of Antitrust Exemption:

         The manager's package eliminates the blanket antitmst exemption contained in the
          underlying bill, which was not necessary to achieve the goals of the legislation and could
          have had anticompetitive effects.

     Stronger Anti-Smuggling Provisions:

          The manager's amendment will strengthen the anti-smuggling provisions in the bill, so as
           to prevent the emergence of contraband markets. The bill, as amended, will create a
           "closed distribution system" for tobacco products so that only licensed entities can sell or
           buy products; it will provide states with resources to establish or improve retail licensing
           systems; it will require manufacturers to mark packages for export to prevent their
           diversion; and it will establish and enforce strong penalties for violations. A very similar
           system has worked to control smuggling of alcoholic beverages for over sixty years.
